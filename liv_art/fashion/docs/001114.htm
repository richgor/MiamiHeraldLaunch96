<P>

   <LI> DKNY at home: Donna Karan is going to try her hand at blankets, sheets, towels, china and eventually furniture, in her first collection for the home, due next year.<P>

   The designer, whose apparel, accessories and cosmetics empire racked up $550 million in revenues last year, follows in the well-heeled footsteps of Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, banking on her name to sell chic sheets as well as sexy black power suits.<P>

   <LI> Galliano's jewelry line: Designer John Galliano has introduced a signature collection of jewelry and accessories, more than 100 pieces reflecting the Native American theme of his fall clothing and accessory line. There are the theatrical pieces one would expect from Galliano, like crocodile-stamped handbags trimmed in silver and a five-strand silver and rhinestone necklace, about $2,000 wholesale (likely twice that in stores). But gold or silver-plated pewter signet rings, hair ornaments, pendants on leather thongs, tie bars and earrings will retail for $100 to $300. Several items are adorned with a lion, Galliano's signature crest.<P>

   <LI> Keepers of the flame: Zippo lighters have become a fashion statement. You saw John Travolta lighting up with one in Pulp Fiction. They were hailed ``Cool Stuff'' in Entertainment Weekly's ``Cool Issue.'' And the many designer models are very big among collectors. An official of the Bradford, Pa.-based company says: ``There's something very appealing about the shape, the feel, the click of a Zippo lighter.''<P>

   <LI> Shoe news: The hot new spring shoe is the open-toed mule, sometimes called the slide. It most often sits on a chunky heel no more than two inches high, just like the pump.<P>

   Neiman Marcus has slides by Via Spiga in fuchsia or lime suede, or in black patent ($130); Saks Fifth Avenue has slides by Atelier Mercadal in snakeskin ($185); by DKNY in black or brown leather with a flat heel ($145); Bloomingdale's has Unisa's multistrap slide in black, pewter or gold ($64), and Unlisted's cutout slide in black or brown ($48).<P>

    <LI> It's in the jeans: So you think it's just women who bring a whole rack full of clothes into the dressing room? When it comes to finding the right pair of jeans, men will practically try on everything in the store, says a survey sponsored by the VF Corp., owner of such brands as Lee, Wrangler and Riders. Seventy-four percent of men vs. 53 percent of women admit to trying on up to four pairs at a time, and 5 percent of men vs. 3 percent of women confess they've tried on more than 20 pairs at a time.<P>
