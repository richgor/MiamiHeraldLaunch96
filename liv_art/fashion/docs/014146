<m0>   Lay it on thick with mother nature, a gift collection that includes a spray cologne, hand cream and a book titled<m0> the philosophy of love.<m0> Heavy on stylish packaging and lower case letters, each item has a philosophy-lite message printed on it.<ep>
  The fragrance is called ``grace.'' On its package: ``how you climb up the mountain is just as important as how you get down the mountain . . . ''<ep>
  And the box that everything comes in: ``a mother loves us in a way that only nature understands. like nature, she is forever giving, asking for nothing in return.''<ep>

<m0>   We're so cool (--) South Florida, that is. Put our name on merchandise and, hey, we'll bite. The latest in local cachet ranges from $5-a-bottle nail lacquer to (--) <m0>yikes <m0>(--) $2,500 jeans. Oh, but they've got 14K gold buttons with palm trees.<ep>
   Can't spare the two-plus grand? The sterling silver version of Denimwear by Dorethea of Palm Beach goes for $500.<ep>
   Don't despair if you've got a single-digit budget. If we believe In Style magazine, Sharon Stone's makeup artist gives a thumbs up to OPI's Caribbean Collection of oh-so-cleverly named nail lacquers. Among the 12 hues are How to Jamaica Million (pearl) and Ponce de Lilac (lavender).<ep>
   Also, for local flavor, we have: Moon Over Miami (pale blue), South Beach Blush (pink) and Florida Key Lime Pie. <m1><ep>

   Created by The Lane Co., the box measures 9 by 4 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches.<ep>
   <m0>Price: <m0>$29.95, includes shipping and handling.<ep>
