essimism is the fashion among haute architects these days.<P>

   No one cares about design anymore, they complain, least of all developers. Moreover, the very promise of architecture has been called into question: The pessimists believe that modern cities simply have become too big, too sprawling and too chaotic to be tamed through mere design.<P>

   ``We were making sand castles,'' writes Rem Koolhaas, possibly the world's hippest and most influential architect. ``Now we swim in the sand that swept them away.''<P>

   Even in South Florida, architects sometimes speak as if design had become a guerrilla campaign. These architects, for example, no longer refer to their work as ``buildings'' or ``projects,'' but instead talk of them as ``interventions.''<P>

   But do not despair. This region is blessed with at least a few ``interventionists'' who, despite small budgets, manage to hold on to the bigger ambitions of Architecture. With a handful of relatively small projects -- lifeguard stands, a Metromover sculpture, neighborhood entrance gates -- they have exerted a powerful pull on what South Florida looks like. Why is this happening here? Maybe it's because South Florida cities are so young, unburdened by the weight of centuries. Whatever the case, the work of the following trio is some cause for optimism:<P>

WILLIAM LANE<BR>
Beach Populist<BR>
 The person who answers the office door is Joe, a twenty-something who until recently was a waiter at Lucky Cheng's, the drag queen restaurant.<P>

   A bull terrier named Buster follows at his heels.<P>

   Then, from amid a cluster of paper-strewn tables, over by the mattress on the floor where he sleeps, there appears William Lane, the abashed architect of what may be the most admired new buildings in South Beach.<P>

   All he has done, really, is design five lifeguard stands. But those five must rank among the most photographed ever. They have popped up in fashion magazines (draped with models), on the front of The New York Times travel section, in Buick commercials and in the film The Birdcage. Even haughty Architecture magazine weighed in:<P>

   ``Some of the most memorable new oceanfront buildings in South Beach are also the smallest . . . life guard stations.''<P>

   Lane is 40, but -- maybe it's the shaved head and goatee -- he looks younger. In New York, where he attended Cooper-Union in the late '70s, he was an East Village club creature. Today, he still looks the part.<P>

   ``Isn't that too much?'' he'll ask often, pointing out office decorations with Dadaesque glee. There is, for example, a picture of Alfred E. Neuman, the giddy moron who is the face of Mad Magazine, and then a statue of a Hindu god, and then a kitschy six-foot metal sculpture of the Eiffel Tower, which Lane rescued from the now-defunct La Extravaganza beauty salon nearby.<P>

   There is also, of course, Joe, the draftsman who works for Lane. A young architect, Joe began his South Florida career not at Lane's office but at Lucky Cheng's: He needed work. (Joe's account of his interview there: ``I said, `Do you need anybody?' She said, `Yeah. Do you do drag?' I said, `Well, no, not really.' She said, `Well, do you want to do lunch?' I said `OK.' But I wore pants.'')<P>

   Lane asks again: ``Isn't that too much?''<P>

   Usually soft-spoken and droll, Lane hardly seems an agitator. But he is, or must have been, because without his persistence, the lifeguard stands never would have been built.<P>

   Initially, Miami Beach bureaucrats simply wanted new lifeguard stands, not an architectural adventure.<P>

   Lane asked several developers to pitch in for the cost. None did. Then he asked for the city to help. Officials balked, then relented. Today, the stands have proved a touristic boon to the city. Lane asked for no money for his work.<P>

   What he has designed for the beach are as playful and vivid as Saturday morning cartoons. But the stands speak to a broader adult audience, trafficking in the flighty media chatter of the global village, all images uprooted, intertwined and retransmitted.<P>

   There is, for example, the lifeguard stand at Sixth Street that Lane has dubbed Mayan Radio Shinto Style,  an ecstatic blend of Maya temples, Shinto architecture and airport towers.<P>

   The others are The Wave,  a distillation of radio waves and hotel entry canopies; Jetson's Tower,  a collaboration with Kenny Scharf, which draws on sci-fi imagery; Purple Mobile Home with Fuselage,  a play on the imagery of trailers, jets and Cadillac fins; and finally, Boomerang Putting Green,  a take on painter Joan Mir&oacute;, Formica patterns and miniature golf.<P>

   Like some other architects who dabble freely in local color and flamboyance, Lane wonders: Will anyone take me seriously?<P>

   ``You know, a lot of people find Miami architecture, starting with Arquitectonica and Morris Lapidus, to be too pop and too image-conscious to be sophisticated,'' Lane says. ``Sophistication to some people means anything that is obscure. Obviously, I think that's wrong.''<P>

   He describes the stands as image-conscious architecture for an image-conscious place.<P>

   ``South Beach is a place where everyone is so body-conscious, so fashion-conscious,'' Lane said. ``I mean, people are always asking, `What's the latest nose ring? What's the latest tattoo?' These designs respond to that.''<P>

   Lane arrived in Miami Beach four years ago, after jobs in New York and the Virgin Islands.<P>

   Most of his work thus far has been on South Beach. He designed the curvaceous maple interior, for example, at the Ann Turk store and the hole-in-the-wall riff at Brandt's Break, a pool hall, both on Washington Avenue. His next project will be the renovation of La Govacha, a West Dade salsa club he will redo, in his words, as ``Tiki huts meet Deconstructivism.''<P>

ROSARIO MARQUARDT<BR>
And ROBERTO BEHAR<BR>
Magicians of Landscape<BR>
  <P>

   Maybe you have seen this couple. They motor around South Florida in their white Cherokee on weekends, cruising aimlessly, peering through the windshield ``just looking at everything.'' And imagining something more.<P>

   If you see them, you remember them.<P>

   She is tall and reserved and when she was a kid in Argentina the other kids called her ``Olivia,'' the Spanish name for Popeye's girlfriend Olive Oyl.<P>

   He is short, gregarious, balding.<P>

   They both wear Panama hats.<P>

   Together, Rosario Marquardt and Roberto Behar have dreamed some dreams for Miami, sketched them together, inking in small notebooks architectural fantasies that ordinarily should be dismissed as impossible.<P>

   Impossible _ except that one of those dreams came to fruition last week.<P>

   Workers finished construction on a towering red M, a mysterious initial on a formerly anonymous stretch of downtown, a monument as tall as a four-story building and as red as a candied apple.<P>

   ``The M stands for Miami and Metromover,'' Roberto begins to explain.<P>

   ``Or for mother,'' she adds.<P>

   `Yes, you see, we would like it to generate as many meanings as possible,'' Roberto continues. ``You know, it could stand for `meaning,' too.''<P>

   The couple is talking in the living room of their small house on Jefferson Avenue in South Beach, a place crammed with books -- novels, histories and outsized art tomes. The walls are hung with Rosario's paintings, richly-coloredportraits taken from Latin American history: saints, conquistadors, Eva Per&oacute;n, tango icon Carlos Gardel.<P>

   The history that brought Roberto and Rosario to this home in South Florida is, in part, a sad one, and one that looms as unreal as the M.<P>

   Foes of the Argentine dictatorships of the 1970s, the couple wrote and distributed thousands of anti-dictatorship pamphlets, running them off from a mimeograph machine hidden beneath Roberto's drawing table. The couple left the country after Rosario's sister was killed and her brother jailed.<P>

   ``It was the most tragic time,'' Rosario says today. ``It felt like living in a dead country.''<P>

   Since then, they ``have fallen in love with Miami,'' and the past seems to have disappeared in the couple's buoyant outlook, for they are both deliriously optimistic about the possibilities here.<P>

   ``Rome is 2,700 years old, but Miami -- Miami is just 100!'' Roberto is fond of saying. ``We are here at the beginning.''<P>

   What makes the M really remarkable is the way it reclaims a virtually abandoned piece of downtown.<P>

   Located on the north side of the Miami River where Metromover crosses, the site once had the feeling of a piece of land left over after the city was built, pinched as it is between a highway overpass, the elevated Metromover tracks and the river. The M changed the place from one that most people drove by -- and never really saw -- into a place that can never be forgotten.<P>

   The duo was chosen to design the $85,000 project for Metromover by the Art in Public Places program.<P>

   ``At first, when we saw the site, we said, 'Oh no,' '' Rosario explains, dropping her face into her palms.<P>

   ``So the first thing we decided was not to do something cute or pretty,'' Roberto adds. ``We needed to intervene, not just at the Metromover stop, but into its surroundings.''<P>

   Once the couple had settled on the idea of something colossal (``we have always been interested in the idea of the colossal in the American experience,'' Roberto says), the M shape took form in Roberto's notebook while he was repeating the word Metromover over and over to himself.<P>

   ``Then it just seemed that the M fit perfectly,'' Rosario said.<P>

    The couple's impact on South Florida is unlikely to end with the M. They have at least two other schemes fully sketched, ready to present to whoever can bring them to life.<P>

   The more probable of the two is a proposal to paint several Metromover cars in dense tropical foliage. <P>

   And then there is the really big idea.<P>

   The couple proposes to carve Flagler Island -- the one in Biscayne Bay with the obelisk -- into a star, forming a beacon to visitors arriving in Miami by plane. The island would be planted as a tropical garden which the public could reach via a short ferry.<P>

   ``It will become known as `The Star of Miami.' '' Roberto predicts. ``Like the Statue of Liberty in New York, it could be the one landmark everyone remembers.''<P>

   No word yet from the city of Miami Beach, which owns the island. In fact, most bureaucrats have never heard of the idea. The couple, after all, has yet to present it. Its cost is not known.<P>

   Says Roberto: ``Now maybe that we have finished the M, people will listen to us.''<BR>
ANTHONY ABBATE<BR>
Homegrown Idealist<BR>
<P>

   A clamor arose for drastic measures. Some residents of Victoria Park proposed planting a forest of stop signs. Others demanded blockading streets. All the while, the growth of downtown Fort Lauderdale was threatening to transform the neighborhood's quiet residential streets into anonymous thoroughfares.<P>

   Enter Anthony Abbate, architect.<P>

   The Victoria Park dilemma provided yet another perfect role for Abbate, a 38-year-old do-gooder eager to use architecture to make his hometown a better place. Since returning to Fort Lauderdale in 1982, Abbate has immersed himself in local issues time and again, designing homes for Habitat for Humanity, setting up a homeowners' hotline after Hurricane Andrew and helping reform Broward's art in public places program.<P>

   The Victoria Park story is typical of Abbate, who is an idealist but not a revolutionary: He has the patience to move one step at a time. In Victoria Park, Abbate spurned the stop signs as impractical; then he deemed the street blockades anti-social.<P>

   His solution: Narrow neighborhood streets at six key entrances, reducing lane widths from 16 feet to 10 feet. Replace the asphalt at the entrances with brick pavers. Erect entrance gates that remind drivers they are cutting through a neighborhood.<P>

   ``The brick pavers will be bumpier and noisier to the drivers,'' Abbate explains. ``That, along with narrowing the travel lanes, will slow people down. No one will confuse the streets in Victoria Park for a highway.''<P>

   The $20,000 entrances, consisting of steel gates and concrete pillars topped with bronze planters, will be paid for by the city and the neighborhood. Construction is expected this summer.<P>

   It is in such small gestures that designers today must seek maximum effect. Look at the homes Abbate designed for Habitat. While limited to ``an ordinary-looking house'' (to avoid stigmatizing the low-income residents), Abbate added front porches to his design, believing that these will make streets feel more friendly.<P>

   Or look at the wooden chairs placed on the sidewalk -- almost like sculpture -- in front of the J. Miles store on Las Olas Boulevard downtown. Though not often used, the chairs declared to passersby -- even before Las Olas became fashionable again -- that neighborhood sidewalks were fit for hanging out.<P>

   ``When I got out of school, I honestly believed that we have control over what we build,'' Abbate said. ``Then I started working. And I realized how marginalized the role of architects had become.''<P>

   In fact, experience has led Abbate to become a developer. He is currently acquiring financing for two townhomes he designed for Fort Lauderdale's Colee Hammock neighborhood.<P>

   ``Good design doesn't always pay,'' Abbate says, ``but being a developer does. Unfortunately, more and more, good design has to come from the heart.''
