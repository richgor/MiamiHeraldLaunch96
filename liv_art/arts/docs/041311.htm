GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE: Jackie Hinchey-Sipes.
<!-- start headlines -->
<H2>Principal's career ends with a big bang</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

   Retirement doesn't get any sweeter than that of Jackie Hinchey-Sipes, 61, principal of Dade's Design and Architecture High School.<P>

   Five years after winning a unanimous vote from the Dade County School Board to create the institution, she has won not only a Redbook award for having one of the nation's best high schools but also the U.S. Department of Education's Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award.<P>

   On May 30-31, she'll be off to the White House to collect accolades from President Clinton.<P>

   ``It's been the most rewarding 32 years anyone could have had,'' she says. It has also been an aging process. <P>

   Principals aren't supposed to teach; they miss too many administrative meetings. Hinchey-Sipes taught.<P>

   A school's hierarchy normally requires an assistant principal; Hinchey-Sipes wanted a ``lead team'' so DASH could benefit from ``all kinds of expertise, not just mine.''<P>

   Most schools require only 24 credits to graduate; DASH requires 32.<P>

 And ``we teach eight periods, though we're only paid to teach six.''<P>

   Bob Thomas, region director of the school system's District Four, is Hinchey-Sipes' direct boss.<P>

   ``The administration of that school, and the progress it has made in addressing youngsters who are talented in those arts, is excellent,'' he said.<P>

   He was noncommittal on a successor, though. Mary Hartley, Hinchey-Sipes' assistant ``is certainly so  ready'' to fill her shoes and has the institutional memory necessary for such tasks, says Betsy Kaplan, former school board chair. But the rules 'n' regs of the Pentagon-like school system say Hartley needs three years under her belt as an assistant principal; because of DASH's initial ``lead team'' approach, she has only two. (Exceptions do take place. Ellery Brown, principal of New World School of the Arts, was in the same boat.)<P>

   On May 18, there's a 7 p.m. open house at DASH to christen a new gallery and gym space. After that, at about 9 p.m., champagne corks will fly, and Hinchey-Sipes' colleagues will raise a last toast to a leader who did it her way.<BR>

   When pianist Raul DiBlasio tickled the ivories for 2,000 minglers at the Superintendent's Ball Saturday night, he did so without charge. His fee was waived by Estefan Enterprises (Gloria and Emilio), which books his dates, says Jerry Morgan, spokesman for Dade County Public Schools, which booked Miami Beach Convention Center for the annual ball.<P>

   The fund-raising goal: $1 million. Proceeds go to scholarships.<P>

   <P>

   At the Florida Grand Opera:<P>

   Charles Caine, costume designer for 15 years, made such an impression on Ariadne auf Naxos  soprano Deborah Voigt that she asked him to design something for her to wear to New York's April 27 megaconcert/gala for James Levine's 25th anniversary gala as artistic director of the Metropolitan Opera.<P>

   He stitched up a dark Mediterranean-blue underdress and, over that, put a sheer silk fitted caftan sewn with sparkles. TV cameras apparently loved it. <P>

   Caine, who also served 15 years as the Met's costume designer before arriving in Miami, next will stitch up costumes for the opera's Young Artists when they perform Julius Caesar  at Miami Beach's Colony Theater Friday through May 12, and at the Broward Performing Arts Center's Amaturo Theater May 14-16. <P>

   <LI><BR>
<P>

  Karl Hesser, who has been discovering and nurturing singers for years, has been promoted to director of artistic administration, where he'll oversee one-third of the opera's $6.9 million budget. He'll continue to recommend casting and negotiate with singers' agents. Wife Debra is the opera's official photographer.<P>

   <LI><BR>
<P>

   Joseph Illick, the opera's former artistic consultant, is the proud new pop of Eric, born Monday in Santa Fe, N.M. Singer-wife Virginia Browning gave birth at home.<P>

   Illick, who sold his Key Biscayne home a couple of years after Hurricane Andrew, is artistic director of both the Lake George Opera in New York and the Shreveport Opera is Louisiana.<P>

 Olga Garay, cultural affairs director of Miami-Dade Community College's Wolfson campus, will participate in a new two-year initiative to develop systems to disseminate information about a variety of issues in the field of international presenting.<P>

   Funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts, the program will involve administrators from the International Society of Performing Arts Administrators, the Brooklyn Academy, the Japan-American Cultural and Community Center and Dance Theater Workshop.<P>

<P>

  On Friday, the new pavilion at the south end of Miami's Bayfront Park -- site of the old bandshell where Cesar Lamonaca led concerts decades ago -- will be officially named the Tina Hills Pavilion.<P>

   Hills has been a member of the Bayfront Park Management Trust since 1987, and, in the words of Trust member Ruth Greenfield, ``the true conscience of the park.''<P>

   Cocktails and laudatories start at 6:30 p.m. Reservations are required; call (305) 358-7550 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays.<P>

<BR>

<P>

   For the Bakehouse Art Complex's Second Sunday Open House May 12, Suzanne Delehanty, director of Miami's Center for the Fine Arts, is juror and judge in a show of members' work.<P>

   Doors will be open 1-5 p.m. Admission is free. Parking is in an enclosed lot at 561 NW 32nd St., Miami. Call (305) 576-2828 for details.<P>

    Spotted a few days ago at South Beach's China Grill: Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft, he the director of Blazing Saddles  and Young Frankenstein  and producer of The Elephant Man,  she the memorable star of The Graduate,  The Turning Point  and Agnes of God.<P>

   Brooks let it be known he wanted no onions at his table, promptly spilled San Pellegrino all over himself and pronounced himself ``a klutz.''
