<m0>(box)<m0> <m0>Dan Marino's Sports Bar and Grill, <m0>CocoWalk, 3015 Grand Ave., Coconut Grove; Ladies Night, Tuesday; Dart Competitions, Wednesday; College Night, Thursday; 567-0013.<m0> <m0><ep>
  Named after the Miami Dolphins' last great hope, this sports bar and restaurant is one of several sports celebrity-themed haunts to pop up around South Florida. Although the baby-faced quarterback hosted his pregame TV chatter, <m0>The Dan Marino Show<m0>, from the Weston Hills Country Club last season, that hasn't stopped sports fans and curious tourists from stopping by.<ep>
  During the week, Marino's attracts an upwardly mobile, tie-and-suspenders crowd who come for the free hot buffet and happy hour specials. The restaurant offers the usual sports bar appetizers and entrees, from buffalo wings to pasta dishes, with indoor and outdoor dining. The main bar is flanked by four pool tables, where several overhead TVs blare ESPN. There's also a large game room and two other bars. When the Panthers and Heat play, it's difficult to find a vacant stool or table.<ep>
   Thursday nights give way to a tan, cruisey crowd from the nearby University of Miami, lured by thrifty drink specials ($3 shots, $2 domestic beers) and loud, pop and alternative music. Suggested pick-up lines to try: ``What's your major?'' and ``Heard the new Collective Soul?''<ep>
