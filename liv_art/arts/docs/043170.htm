and Laura Esterman -- transcending a soporific script to give galvanizing performances in Ladies in Retirement? Or a ferocious Kenneth Mars bombastically driving Lucky -- and the rest of an otherwise star-crossed production -- in Waiting for Godot?<P>

   Counterbalancing those great moments, we would like to forget the largely humorless failings of Rafael V. Blanco's original Encore Room play Mama's Last Waltz, the casting deficiencies (a luminous Stephanie Douglas excepted) of the stunningly produced but distinctly disappointing Cole Porter musical You Never Know, the vapid trifle that was Radio Days, the almost-there quality of Evelyn Mayerson's sporadically engaging Marjory Stoneman Douglas portrait in the playhouse-commissioned Marjory.<P>

   Even Mittelman is willing to nitpick with ``20-20 hindsight.'' He would have insisted on chopping the three-hour Ladies in Retirement script. He would have used older actors, to emphasize how the characters made the same mistakes over and over, in You Never Know. He would have tried to have a couple more weeks of rehearsal on Samuel Beckett's fascinating, alienating Godot  ``so we could have coped with just how big a mountain it is.''<P>

   For all that, he said, ``It felt like a very rich season.''<P>

   And it was.<BR>
Death of a Salesman, was impeccably done. The other (Godot) was dogged by so much misfortune -- flawed direction, less-than-effective casting of the leads, illness, injury, the defection of two actors -- that Mittelman now calls it ``the French play,'' a reference to the theatrical superstition that leads actors to call Macbeth  ``the Scottish play,'' lest horrible luck befall them.<P>

   He got the rights to a hot-from-Off-Broadway property (Death Defying Acts), and instantly gave his audiences a well-produced contemporary play with edge and humor. He did the right thing in commissioning a play about a bigger-than-life South Florida personality (Marjory), and in continuing to nurture the play-writing career of Blanco, the theater's longtime stage manager. Though I'd argue that a number of other South Florida playwrights are at least as deserving of such support. In bringing Holbrook, Harris, Brennan, Esterman, Mars and Klein to the theater, he allowed us to savor the work of some of our country's finest actors.<P>

  The 1996-97 season is to include the British reworking of Jean Cocteau's Indiscretions, a revival of Edward Albee's take-no-prisoners Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?  and a pair of world premieres (the musical Palm Beach and the comedy The Bench). Still, you never know exactly what you'll get at the Grove or most other theaters 'til you're in the thick of a season, and I am concerned.<P>

<BR>

<P>

   I still think that Mittelman isn't using enough South Florida-based actors. True, the locals were used exclusively in the smaller Encore Room space, and they had small supporting roles in Death of a Salesman (which toured after it left the Grove) and larger parts in Death Defying Acts. But it's still true that the South Florida-based actor who's worked the most at the Grove in significant roles is Judith Delgado, the theater's director of education (and Mittelman's former wife). If there were a vast qualitative difference between the actors Mittelman brings in from New York and Los Angeles and the ones who have built their careers here, the Grove's casting bias would make sense. But there isn't, and it doesn't.<P>

   I worry that, despite an annual budget of nearly $4 million, Mittelman may be doing too much production-shopping and not generating enough great stuff on his own main stage. Ladies in Retirement  was the brainchild of Harris and director Charles Nelson Reilly. Radio Gals  ran at several other theaters first. Salesman  was done previously, by Holbrook and director Gerald Freedman, in Cleveland. You Never Know  began at New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse. It's certainly not uncommon for regional theaters like the Grove to co-produce with other regionals or to pick up their shows, but great regionals create a fair share of their own exciting productions.<P>

   I wonder why the plays of Nilo Cruz, Eduardo Machado and Maria Irene Fornes, the top of the crop of Cuban-American playwrights, haven't been done at the Grove. Mittelman keeps saying he needs a third theater, with seating in the 200-to-300 range, to do more ``ethnically driven and cutting-edge'' work. Whether he gets that space or not, he could be doing the scripts by the aforementioned writers in the Encore Room.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   For all that, I have company as I look back on '95-96 at the Grove with more satisfaction than not. Subscriptions increased by 10 percent for this season, and renewals for next year have already passed 50 percent -- the strongest renewal rate in five years. Sales of the Flex Pass, a kind of mini-subscription allowing the theatergoer to choose any six of the theater's eight plays, are up 40 percent.<P>

   And wonderful theater can translate into wonderful box office: Single-ticket sales for Death of a Salesman led the lineup at $127,000, Death Defying Acts (which has been extended twice, through May 19) did $79,500 during its regular three-week run. (Conversely, ``the French play'' sold just $17,500 worth of single tickets, and one irate man wrote Mittelman to say that Godot was the worst thing he'd seen in 76 years.)<P>

   Is this season a happy anomaly, or does it signal an artistic tide change at the Grove? Let's hope Mittelman has learned from this year: You don't have to pander to prosper.
