   Though its Tony Awards are a half-century old this year, Broadway cast a vote for youth and exuberance on Monday when the Pulitzer Prize-winning Rent and the ode-to-tap musical Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk got 10 and nine nominations respectively to lead all shows in the race for the 50th annual Tonys.<P>

   The awards, which will be presented June 2 from 9 to 11 a.m. on CBS (channels 4 and 12) in ceremonies hosted by nominee Nathan Lane, pit Rent (by 35-year-old Jonathan Larson, who died the night before the lionized show's first preview Off-Broadway) against Noise/Funk (a musical that didn't even exist on its first day of rehearsal at Off-Broadway's Public Theater last August) in five categories: best musical, best book, best score, best actor in a musical and best lighting design.<P>

   The deeper question, of course, is whether hidebound Broadway will actually give these noisy, revitalizing, transferred-from-downtown upstarts awards as well as nominations. Though it's true that the Tonys are reaching out to younger theater fans with a World Wide Web site (<a href="http://www.tonys.org">http://www.tonys.org</a>), the awards themselves are voted on by 720 theater folk and journalists, many of whom are older -- way, way older -- than the target audiences for Rent and Noise/Funk.<P>

 <BR>
<BR>

  The rest of the competition for best musical consists of two productions that are no longer running, Chronicle of a Death Foretold and Swinging on a Star. Snubbed though eligible in that category were three musicals based on movies: Big, Victor/Victoria and State Fair.<P>

   Rent, as it happens, is not the only Pulitzer-winning script in competi<BR>
<BR>
tion.<P>

   The Steppenwolf Theater production of Sam Shepard's Buried Child -- winner of 1979's drama Pulitzer -- was substantially rewritten by Shepard and is up for the best play Tony and four others; in fact, it was done Off-Broadway in 1978, and the new version represents Shepard's Broadway debut. Its strongest competition is from Terrence McNally's Master Class, followed by August Wilson's Seven Guitars (which led all plays with eight nominations) and David Hare's now-closed Racing Demon.<P>

 <BR>
  The Lincoln Center Theater production of Edward Albee's 1966 Pulitzer-winning A Delicate Balance, with seven nominations, is the hot contender for best revival of a play. Two British productions -- the Peter Hall-directed An Ideal Husband and the Royal Shakespeare Company's A Midsummer Night's Dream -- as well as the National Actors Theatre's heralded Inherit the Wind are also nominated.<P>

   Despite the glowing reviews for A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, that musical revival got just four nominations (including the one predicted for star Nathan Lane before the show ever opened) vs. eight for the sumptuous revival of The King and I. Their competition, long since vanished from Broadway, is Company and Hello, Dolly!<P>

   Hot individual contenders are Victor/Victoria star Julie Andrews, who has never won a Tony but is widely considered a lock for best actress in a musical; Savion Glover, up for best actor in a musical but the likely winner of the best choreographer Tony (since the best actor honor has been all but given to Lane); and Zoe Caldwell, a best actress in a play nominee for her mesmerizing Maria Callas in Master Class.
