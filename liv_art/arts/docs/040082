   NEW YORK (--) With apologies to Stephen Sondheim, a slight rewrite of <m0>Comedy Tonight<m0>, the opening number from this season's boisterous Broadway revival of <m0>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum<m0>: <m1> <m0>Something appealing/nothing appalling/something for everyone/a comedy (or musical or play or revival) tonight!<m0><ep>
   And it's true: <m1> <m0>Who can remember a better Broadway spring, an end-of-season so varied and so loaded with shows genuinely worth seeing?<ep>
   Here, nine of your best choices if the island of Manhattan is in your travel plans.<ep>
  (box) <m0>Rent<m0>, Nederlander Theater, 208 W. 41st St.; $30-$67.50; (212) 921-8000: <m1> <m0>Both the tragedy and triumph of the season, <m0>Rent <m0>lost its dazzlingly talented creator Jonathan Larson, who died the night before its first preview Off-Broadway, only to be hailed as the greatest merging of rock and theater since <m0>Hair<m0>. <m1> <m0>Which it is.<ep>
   Making a triumphant move from downtown to midtown's funk-enhanced Nederlander Theatre, <m0>Rent <m0>is a roiling '90s take on <m0>La Boheme<m0>, with head-miked junkies, musicians, arty types and the AIDS-afflicted standing in (--) with swagger, style and heart-rending pathos (--) for Puccini's bohemians. <m1> <m0>Larson's melodically haunting, life-affirming songs; his soap opera's worth of interwoven stories; the ambitious richness of <m0>Rent<m0>; the sorrow of an exciting new voice too soon stilled: <m1> <m0>It all makes <m0>Rent <m0>the stuff of legend. <ep>
  (box) <m0>Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk<m0>, Ambassador Theatre, <m1> <m0>219 W. 49th St.; $20-$67.50; (800) 432-7250: <m1> <m0>It's a miracle, really: <m1> <m0>From a first rehearsal in which nothing but ideas and concept existed, <m0>Noise/Funk <m0>evolved into an explosive, stylish meditation on the rhythms (--) in song, words, percussion and movement (--) that have sustained African Americans from slave days to the edge of the millennium.<ep>
   This transferred Public Theater production, inventively sculpted by director George C. Wolfe, is driven by the ferocious talent of tap star (and choreographer) Savion Glover; by dancers who are, to a man, individualistically intriguing; by former Times Square bucket drummers who get thunder from pots, pans and each other; by the sensuous singing of composer Ann Duquesnay; and, in the smartest change for Broadway, by the ferociously poetic performance of Tony Award-winner Jeffrey Wright. <m0>Noise/Funk <m0>audiences don't give standing ovations: They <m0>scream <m0>them.<ep>
  (box) <m0>Seven Guitars<m0>, Walter Kerr Theater, 219 W. 48th St.; $15-$60; (800) 432-7250: <m1> <m0>The sixth in August Wilson's cycle of plays about African Americans in each decade of the 20th Century, <m0>Seven Guitars <m0>is laced with otherworldly spirits, betrayal, lust and loss. <m1> <m0>Each of the seven characters in this end-of-the-'40s piece has a distinctive, memorable voice conveyed through the author's extraordinary, street-smart poetry. <m1> <m0>Wilson creates a world and envelops you in it. Surrender is total and deliciously entertaining.<ep>
  (box) <m0>Buried Child<m0>, Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 W. 47th St.; $42.50-$45; (800) 432-7250: <m1> <m0>Sam Shepard's families have dark, sick secrets (--) perhaps none more ominous and obvious than the one nourishing a backyard bumper crop in <m0>Buried Child<m0>. <m1> <m0>This revised, revitalized 1979 Pulitzer winner has all the thrilling hallmarks of a Steppenwolf production: <m1> <m0>Crystalline, insightful direction by Gary Sinise; vibrant, infinitely detailed performances by Lois Smith (wait 'til you see her transformation!), by the whiskey-throated James Gammon, by a haunted Terry Kinney and a frightening Leo Burmester; and the omnipresent edge that keeps pulling you, hypnotically, toward the stage.<ep>
   <m0>(box)<m0> A Delicate Balance<m0>, Plymouth Theater, 236 W. 45th St.; $35-$45; (800) 432-7250: <m1>  <m0>Another odd family, more poetic language, women with wicked tongues (--) what could it be but an Edward Albee play? <m1> <m0>This 1966 Pulitzer Prize winner mixes mystery (upper-class neighbors driven to seek refuge from an unnamed terror), manipulation (Rosemary Harris as a commandingly elegant matron who orchestrates the lives of one and all), denial (Elaine Stritch, brilliant as a constant drinker who eschews the tag ``alcoholic'') and ludicrousness (Mary Beth Hurt as a four-times-wed daughter returning to the nest, tantrums included, yet again) in an irresistible, impeccable excursion into the lives of those we would not be.<ep>
  (box) <m0>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum<m0>, St. James Theater, 246 W. 44th St.; $25-$70; (800) 432-7250: <m1> <m0>Yet another grand outing by director Jerry Zaks' unofficial comedy rep troupe (--) Nathan Lane (he of the worried countenance and hilarious delivery), Lewis Stadlen, Ernie Sabella and Mark Linn-Baker (--) this <m0>Forum <m0>revival is more cartoonish than stylish, more obvious than hilarious. <m1> <m0>Though it's hurt by some bad casting, watching Lane as the scheming Pseudolus is a treat everyone ought to have.<ep>
  (box) <m0>The King and I<m0>, Neil Simon Theater, 250 W. 52nd St.; $25-$75; (800) 755-4000: <m1> <m0>Lou Diamond Phillips following in Yul Brynner's bare footsteps? <m1> <m0>It may strike you as a puzzlement, but believe it: <m1> <m0>His virile, commanding performance as the king of Siam in this sumptuous Rodgers and Hammerstein revival was strong enough to earn Phillips a Tony nod as best actor in a musical. <m1> <m0>A visual feast in tones of shimmering gold and fiery orange, this unexpectedly glorious <m0>King and I <m0>also boasts a powerful yet carefully calibrated performance from Tony nominee Donna Murphy as Anna; spine-tinglingly beautiful singing from Joohee Choi as Tuptim and Taewon Kim as Lady Thiang; Lar Lubovitch's wonderful recreation of Jerome Robbins' <m0>Small House of Uncle Thomas <m0>ballet; and every scripted delight this wonderful, moving musical can provide when done in top form. <m1> <m0>As it is here.<ep>
  (box) <m0>Big<m0>, Shubert Theater, 225 W. 44th St.; $42.50-$70; (800) 432-7250: <m1> <m0>Some would disagree, but I think <m0>Big <m0>(--) dissed heartily during its out-of-town tryout (--) is the season's comeback kid. <m1> <m0>No, its Richard Maltby Jr.-David Shire score isn't the greatest. <m1> <m0>But Susan Stroman's fabulously imaginative choreography (danced frighteningly well by a chorus of kids), Daniel Jenkins' captivating performance as the instantly grown-up Josh Baskin (as engaging as Tom Hanks was in the movie version) and Patrick Levis' alluring young Josh, all help to make <m0>Big <m0>a far better, fresher family show than any Broadway has seen since <m0>Annie<m0>.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Master Class<m0>, Golden Theater, 252 W. 45th St.; $32.50-$45; (800) 432-7250: <m1> <m0>Master Class<m0>, Terrence McNally's adoring ode to opera diva Maria Callas, is a deliberately distorted and highly entertaining meditation on the sometimes terrible price of fame.<ep>
   A proud, insightful, callous Callas rules the class that provides the play's structure. <m1> <m0>Three students are put to comic, moving and intensely dramatic use. <m1> <m0>Tony nominee Zoe Caldwell is combustible throughout. <m1> <m0>In her lusty, sorrowful performance, the soprano known as ``La Divina'' lives again.<ep>
