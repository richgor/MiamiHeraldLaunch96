   It's a little like Home Depot meets Stonehenge.<P>

   It's a cluster of 60 whirling metal balls mounted on 60 galvanized metal fence posts, sunk into the ground in two concentric circles. The posts are six and eight feet tall. Slightly taller posts hold shiny aluminum pinwheels, marking the circles at points north, south, east and west.<P>

    Since mid-March, Susan Banks, a professor at the New World School of the Arts, and South Florida artist Jack Lembeck have worked with a dozen New World students to make Windscape, a public art installation covering nearly 6,500 square feet at the southern end of Bayfront Park.<P>

   The piece, which will remain standing for eight days, was finished Thursday night, just in time for ceremonies naming the park's amphitheater the Tina Hills Pavilion, in honor of arts supporter and park-board member Tina Hills.<P>

    The metal balls, actually turbines most often seen on rooftops and used for ventilating homes, shimmer in the noonday sun with lollipop colors: cherry, lemon, lime, blueberry.<P>

    Twirling in the stiff breeze, the turbines change color every second, so unlike the stern gray skyscrapers rising up behind them. Playful with a purpose, they celebrate one of the most powerful parts of South Florida's environment: the winds that have guided travelers here for centuries, those gusty currents that can soothe or sear our daily life.<P>

    The pavilion is permanent, but the art will come and go, just like the wind. You can see Windscape through May 18, when the park hosts a festival, ``Windscapes and Landscapes: A Celebration of Multicultural Miami.'' The free festival celebrates the Dade County Schools' Diversity Week, with musical performances and art activities for children.<P>

    The festival, like Windscape itself, honors those diverse, kaleidoscopic energies that make up the creative process. And that's partly why the art here is momentary and mercurial, made with materials easy to take down.<P>

     ``Jack and Susan and I had talked about doing public art in the park,'' says Tim Schmand, grants coordinator for the trust. ``I like the temporary nature, because we get to explore the process and involve students so that they can see what `real artists' do when they make art.''<P>

   The project, commissioned by the Bayfront Park Management Trust, was supported by a $3,600 arts and education grant from the State of Florida's division of cultural affairs. Metro-Dade Cultural Affairs kicked in $3,000 for the May 18 event, and an anonymous donor, Schmand says, ``stepped in with a sizable check to extend the installation,'' originally planned for only two days.<P>

    ``Miami is a perfect place for public art,'' says Banks. The climate makes the outdoors always available, and ``there are a lot of areas where public art could make the downtown area come alive,'' says Banks, who worked with Lembeck, her students and local businesses a year ago to create Brittle Star Park, a lively piece of landscaping, murals and sculpture on a previously empty lot on Northeast Second Avenue. ``Art can do that because it opens up a new point of view.''<P>

    Glen Ramgoolan agrees. His company, Glen's Tents, Tables & Rentals Inc., lent the fence posts and installed them. When he first saw all the parts to Windscape, he says, ``I thought it was crazy. But now I have to eat my words. It's beautiful.''
