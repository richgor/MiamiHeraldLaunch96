TODAY<BR>
<P>

   <LI> Anything this spiny and beady-eyed has got  to be a delicacy. We're referring to crawfish, the creepy crustaceans that have earned their own festival. The fourth annual Cajun/Zydeco Crawfish Festival features a pig roast, a crawfish boil, Cajun and Creole food, children's activities and live music by headliners the Iguanas, among others. Crawfish-eating contests will be held at 5 p.m. Saturday and 5:30 p.m. Sunday. Festival hours are 5:30 p.m.-midnight tonight, 11:30 a.m.-midnight Saturday, 11:30 a.m.-8 p.m. Sunday at Mills Pond Park, 2201 Powerline Rd. (Northwest Ninth Avenue), Fort Lauderdale. Here's a concert schedule: Waylon Thibodeaux (7 tonight) and Steve Riley & the Mamou Boys (10 tonight); Gumbo Boogie Band (noon and 10 p.m. Saturday), Bourbon Street Jazz Band (2:30 p.m. Saturday), Bruce Daigrepont Cajun Band (6 p.m. Saturday), Wayne Toups & Zydecajun (10:30 p.m. Saturday); Gumbo Boogie Band (1:30 p.m. Sunday), Geno Delafose & French Rockin' Boogie (2 p.m. Sunday), Bourbon Street Jazz Band (3:30 p.m. Sunday), The Iguanas (4 p.m. Sunday), Beausoleil (6 p.m. Sunday). Admission is $5 a day (in advance), $7 a day at the gate (free for kids 12 and under). Parking is $3 a car per day. Call 761-5934.<P>

  <LI> ``Of all the people that got fired from the post office and came back to shoot the post office up, how many of them were black or Mexican?'' asks comedian Carlos Mencia. ``None. White people when you snap, you go too far.'' Mencia, host of HBO's Loco Slam specials, performs his ethnic-couched comedy at the Comedy Zone this weekend. Show times are 8, 10 and midnight tonight, Saturday and 10 p.m. Sunday at the Comedy Zone, 1121 Washington Ave., Miami Beach. Tickets are $15. Call 672-4788.<P>

     <LI> If you missed last year's Faith Healer, the Carbonell award-winning drama about a traveling Irish charlatan and the people whose lives he touches, the luck of the Irish is with ye. The New World Repertory Company revives its production at 8 tonight through May 19. Show times are 8 p.m. Thursday, Friday and Saturday and 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at the New World School of the Arts, Louise O. Gerrits Theater, 25 NE Second St., Miami. Tickets are $16 for adults; $8 students/senior citizens. Call 237-7635. <P>

 SATURDAY<P>

<LI> Alternative rockers Spacehog will perform tracks from their hit CD Resident Alien with opening act Marry Me Jane, the band fronted by breathy-voiced Amanda Kravat, whose yearning melodies and acoustic guitars adorn the soundtrack for the Sarah Jessica Parker comedy If Lucy Fell. (Think Lisa Loeb meets Jewel.) Showtime is at 8 p.m. Saturday at The Edge, 200 W. Broward Blvd., Fort Lauderdale. Tickets are $10. Call Ticketmaster.<P>

  <LI> Freddick Bratcher and Company will perform popular works from past dance performances, including Deghettorized Boho Hip Hop, Play It Loose  and Wheel Game.

For information, call 537-3410, the center box office at 929-8175 or Ticketmaster.<P>

   <LI> The Shell Air and Sea Show promises enough jets and high-tech war toys to invade a nearby dictatorship (we won't mention which one). Here's what to expect: Fokker DR-1 triplane, U.S. Navy Blue Angels aerobatics team and Seal assault team, U.S. Army Golden Knights parachute team, U.S. Coast Guard air/sea rescue demonstration, U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jet, U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcat, and U.S. Air Force B-2 Stealth Bomber and F-117 Stealth Fighter, Blackhawk Troop Transport helicopter and B-52 Stratofortress and more.

The Shell Air and Sea Show Display Village runs from 9 a.m.-5 p.m., featuring Nerveless Nocks Swaypole Act, civilian and military land and marine vehicles, civic, government, military and corporate displays, along the beach north of East Sunrise Boulevard. Free shuttle service will be provided from 8 a.m.-11 p.m. Saturday and 8 a.m.-6 p.m. Sunday from Holiday Park, Sunrise Boulevard at U.S. 1, and the downtown parking garages, Southeast Second Street at Second Avenue, Fort Lauderdale. Call (954) 527-5600 ext. 88. See page 27G.<P>

THE REST OF THE WEEK<P>

   <LI> What becomes a country crooner most? Apparently, a showbiz name. Kentucky crooner Wynonna, (Wynonna, Tell Me Why) wasn't always a Judd. She used to go by the moniker Christina Ciminella. But whatever you call her, the country chanteuser makes the South Florida circuit this weekend. See her at 8 p.m. Wednesday-Thursday at the Sunrise Musical Theatre, 5555 NW 95th Ave., Sunrise. Tickets are $32.75, $27.75, $19.75. Call (954) 741-7300.<P>

   <LI> It's a dance thing: The world-renowned Dance Theatre of Harlem performs two programs of different ballets, including Signs and Wonders, choreographed to traditional African music and The Prodigal Son, by George Balanchine. Signs and Wonders, The Prodigal Son and Dougla will be performed at 8 p.m. Thursday and 8 p.m. May 18. Concerto in F, Medea and Firebird will be performed at 8 p.m. May 17 and 2 p.m. May 18 at the Jackie Gleason Theater, 1700 Washington Ave., Miami Beach. Tickets are $15 to $50. Call Ticketmaster.<P>
