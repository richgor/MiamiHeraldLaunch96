<m0>I<m2><ql>
<m1> <m0>can't recall feeling this way for a long time, so I might as well confess: I enjoyed going to the Coconut Grove Playhouse this season.<ep>
   Anyone who's followed The Herald's ongoing commentary about Florida's largest regional theater may need smelling salts after reading the previous paragraph. Over the course of Producing Artistic Director Arnold Mittelman's 11-year tenure, we've cajoled, we've suggested, we've prodded, we've complained (--) and, boy, have we criticized.<ep>
   But, looking back at the Grove's 1995-96 season, you have to celebrate the theater's artistic gains. Even as you ask for more.<ep>

Loman's fruitless trips in the theater's incandescent production of Arthur Miller's <m0>Death of a Salesman<m0>? <m1><styl>mugl,0<ql>
Klein<ue5><ql>
<m0>Or Lauren Klein, in the theater's current production of <m0>Death Defying Acts<m0>, as a burned-out hooker clinging tenuously to life via a suicide hotline? Or three brilliant actresses (--) Julie Harris, Eileen Brennan <m4>Klein<m2><ql>
<m0>and Laura Esterman (--) transcending a soporific script to give galvanizing performances in <m0>Ladies in Retirement<m0>? Or a ferocious Kenneth Mars bombastically driving Lucky (--) and the rest of an otherwise star-crossed production (--) in <m0>Waiting for Godot<m0>?<ep>
   Counterbalancing those great moments, we would like to forget the largely humorless failings of Rafael V. Blanco's original Encore Room play <m0>Mama's Last Waltz<m0>, the casting deficiencies (a luminous Stephanie Douglas excepted) of the stunningly produced but distinctly disappointing Cole Porter musical <m0>You Never Know<m0>, the vapid trifle that was <m0>Radio Days<m0>, the almost-there quality of Evelyn Mayerson's sporadically engaging Marjory Stoneman Douglas portrait in the playhouse-commissioned <m0>Marjory<m0>.<ep>
   Even Mittelman is willing to nitpick with ``20-20 hindsight.'' He would have insisted on chopping the three-hour <m0>Ladies in Retirement <m0>script. He would have used older actors, to emphasize how the characters made the same mistakes over and over, in <m0>You Never Know<m0>. He would have tried to have a couple more weeks of rehearsal on Samuel Beckett's fascinating, alienating <m0>Godot  <m0>``so we could have coped with just how big a mountain it is.''<ep>
   For all that, he said, ``It felt like a very rich season.''<ep>
   And it was.<ql>
<m1>A few classics<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Mittelman gave us a couple of classic plays. One, <m0>Death of a Salesman<m0>, was impeccably done. The other (<m0>Godot<m0>) was dogged by so much misfortune (--) flawed direction, less-than-effective casting of the leads, illness, injury, the defection of two actors (--) that Mittelman now calls it ``the French play,'' a reference to the theatrical superstition that leads actors to call <m0>Macbeth  <m0>``the Scottish play,'' lest horrible luck befall them.<ep>
   He got the rights to a hot-from-Off-Broadway property (<m0>Death Defying Acts<m0>), and instantly gave his audiences a well-produced contemporary play with edge and humor. He did the right thing in commissioning a play about a bigger-than-life South Florida personality (<m0>Marjory<m0>), and in continuing to nurture the play-writing career of Blanco, the theater's longtime stage manager. Though I'd argue that a number of other South Florida playwrights are at least as deserving of such support. In bringing Holbrook, Harris, Brennan, Esterman, Mars and Klein to the theater, he allowed us to savor the work of some of our country's finest actors.<ep>
  The 1996-97 season is to include the British reworking of Jean Cocteau's <m0>Indiscretions<m0>, a revival of Edward Albee's take-no-prisoners <m0>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?  <m0>and a pair of world premieres (the musical <m0>Palm Beach<m0> and the comedy <m0>The Bench<m0>). Still, you never know <m0>exactly <m0>what you'll get at the Grove or most other theaters 'til you're in the thick of a season, and I am concerned.<ep>
 <m1>A lack of local presence<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   I still think that Mittelman isn't using enough South Florida-based actors. True, the locals were used exclusively in the smaller Encore Room space, and they had small supporting roles in <m0>Death of a Salesman <m0>(which toured after it left the Grove) and larger parts in <m0>Death Defying Acts<m0>. <m1> <m0>But it's still true that the South Florida-based actor who's worked the most at the Grove in significant roles is Judith Delgado, the theater's director of education (and Mittelman's former wife). If there were a vast qualitative difference between the actors Mittelman brings in from New York and Los Angeles and the ones who have built their careers here, the Grove's casting bias would make sense. But there isn't, and it doesn't.<ep>
   I worry that, despite an annual budget of nearly $4 million, Mittelman may be doing too much production-shopping and not generating enough great stuff on his own main stage. <m0>Ladies in Retirement  <m0>was the brainchild of Harris and director Charles Nelson Reilly. <m0>Radio Gals  <m0>ran at several other theaters first. <m0>Salesman  <m0>was done previously, by Holbrook and director Gerald Freedman, in Cleveland. <m0>You Never Know  <m0>began at New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse. It's certainly not uncommon for regional theaters like the Grove to co-produce with other regionals or to pick up their shows, but great regionals create a fair share of their own exciting productions.<ep>
   I wonder why the plays of Nilo Cruz, Eduardo Machado and Maria Irene Fornes, the top of the crop of Cuban-American playwrights, haven't been done at the Grove. Mittelman keeps saying he needs a third theater, with seating in the 200-to-300 range, to do more ``ethnically driven and cutting-edge'' work. Whether he gets that space or not, he could be doing the scripts by the aforementioned writers in the Encore Room.<ql>
<m1>Strong box office<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   For all that, I have company as I look back on '95-96 at the Grove with more satisfaction than not. Subscriptions increased by 10 percent for this season, and renewals for next year have already passed 50 percent (--) the strongest renewal rate in five years. Sales of the Flex Pass, a kind of mini-subscription allowing the theatergoer to choose any six of the theater's eight plays, are up 40 percent.<ep>
   And wonderful theater <m0>can <m0>translate into wonderful box office: Single-ticket sales for <m0>Death of a Salesman <m0>led the lineup at $127,000, <m0>Death Defying Acts <m0>(which has been extended twice, through May 19) did $79,500 during its regular three-week run. (Conversely, ``the French play'' sold just $17,500 worth of single tickets, and one irate man wrote Mittelman to say that <m0>Godot <m0>was the worst thing he'd seen in 76 years.)<ep>
   Is this season a happy anomaly, or does it signal an artistic tide change at the Grove? <m1> <m0>Let's hope Mittelman has learned from this year: You don't have to pander to prosper.<ep>
