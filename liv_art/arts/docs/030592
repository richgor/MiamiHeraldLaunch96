<m0>  Just when things were starting to get a bit dull, South Beach masterminds have risen to the occasion, introducing a new round of nocturnal options for glampires with so much time on their hands.<ep>
   The biggest news of the week is that <m0>Glam Slam<m0> (--) the exceedingly grand South Beach club that was closed by the state in January after a police raid (--) looks like it will reopen soon. We can't tell you how psyched we are. <m0>Warsaw <m0>and <m0>Les Bains <m0>owner <m0>Yves Dilena <m0>says he is quietly taking over management of the three-story Art Deco-era club as soon as the state reinstates the liquor license; the target is Memorial Day.<ep>
   Still owned by rock star <m0>Prince<m0>, <m0>Glam Slam<m0> will focus on live entertainment, including an as-yet-unbooked concert by the newly wed musician, says Yves. In the works for Saturday is a gay night, says GM <m1> <m0>Maxwell Blandford<m0>, who, along with fellow GM <m0>Gary Santis<m0>, Yves and new promotions specialist <m0>Kevin Crawford<m0> (from the club's previous management group) will form the team. ``People will be happy to see the Beach back to the way it was,'' says Yves. We couldn't agree more.<ep>
    More changes for <m0>Rocket<m0>, a club whose identity has been in a state of constant flux since it opened in August of last year. ``The straights thought it was gay and the gays thought it was straight,'' says one source who doesn't wish to go on the record. While the club never achieved great popularity as either, the new management team has decided to be a little of each (--) a totally mixed environment, if that is possible. The new name is <m0>Planet X<m0>; the first installment of parties will be this weekend with <m0>Unleashed<m0>, two underground parties tonight <m1> <m0>and Saturday starting at midnight.<ep>
   <m0>Liquid<m0>, a club whose obscene popularity has yet to abate, had such success with last Tuesday's cocktail soiree for the <m0>Billboard Latin <m1> <m0>Music Conference<m0> hosted by gorgeous <m0>Sofia Vergara<m0> for new Latin talent <m0>Lina Santiago <m0>(--) that it has decided to start a weekly equivalent. Called <m0>Bomba <m0>(literally, ``bomb'' en espanol), the new live Latin music night will debut on Thursday, May 23, which is also the birthday of <m0>Ingrid Casares<m0>, VGP (Very Glamorous Person) and partner of Liquid. The special talent for the night, which we are definitely not at liberty to discuss, is muy caliente, trust us.<ep>
   <m0>Meet Me in Miami<m0>, the one-stop club gear shop, will be opening a <m1> <m0>branch in downtown Miami. ``I think downtown's ready for something outrageous,'' says the prophetic <m0>Debbie O.<m0>, owner/designer of the company. Look for Meet Me's trademark outrageousness to open on West Flagler next to the <m0>Wild Pair<m0>, everyone's favorite cheap shoe store. The building, which used to house <m0>Ultra Fabrics<m0>, is the coolest around (--) upstairs tenants include hip artists <m0>Carlos Betancourt<m0> and <m0>Pablo Soria<m0>.<ep>
   <m0>Events of the week<ep>
<m0>   Lots of dizzying parties (--) too many, in fact. Everyone you talk to is, like, when will it start slowing down? Among last week's fun fetes: 1) the Billboard music award after-party at <m0>Starfish <m0>(reopened for the occasion), where the overflowing crowd danced atop tables till 4 a.m., on a school night; 2) Wednesday's weekly party mayhem at the <m0>Forge<m0>, where celebrants included actors <m0>John Enos<m0> and (girlfriend) <m0>Traci Lords<m0>, plus visiting Chicago Bulls stars <m0>Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman<m0> and <m0>John Salley<m0>; 3) <m0>the Church<m0>'s third-year anniversary party at <m0>Groove Jet<m0>, which was converted into the <m0>Night of the Pharoahs<m0>, complete with 10-foot sphinxes, a thick haze of Egyptian musk incense and gold and green lame(acu) covering almost every available crevice; by 2:30 a.m. the crowd had swollen to 1,000, red-lighting the ever-conscientious fire marshal; 4) the grand opening party of the Hollywood location of the South Beach-based <m0>Post Edge<m0>, a video post-production company, where locals included the Beach Convention Center's <m0>Bob Papke <m0>and the New World Symphony's <m0>Lisa Reeves<m0>; 5) birthday celebrations for <m0>Details, Details<m0>' <m0>Norma Jean Abraham<m0> at the <m0>Delano <m0>(where all guests at the Sunday brunch were asked to wear white, making some of us look angelic, others merely like Delano staff) and at <m0>Bash<m0>; and 6) <m0>UFA's Godparent House<m0> luncheon at the <m0>Doral Ocean Beach Resort<m0>, where Saks Bal Harbour presented Venezuelan designer <m0>Angel Sanchez<m0>'s fall collection and legendary model <m0>Carmen <m0>was guest of honor; what's really beautiful is that 600 people, under the tireless efforts of UFA chairman <m0>Al Evans<m0>, raised $400,000 to combat AIDS.<ep>
More of everything next week. Peace.<ep>
