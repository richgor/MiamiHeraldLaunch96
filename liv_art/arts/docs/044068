   Though its Tony Awards are a half-century old this year, Broadway cast a vote for youth and exuberance on Monday when the Pulitzer Prize-winning <m0>Rent <m0>and the ode-to-tap musical <m0>Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk <m0>got 10 and nine nominations respectively to lead all shows in the race for the 50th annual Tonys.<ep>
   The awards, which will be presented June 2 from 9 to 11 a.m. on CBS (channels 4 and 12) in ceremonies hosted by nominee Nathan Lane, pit <m0>Rent <m0>(by 35-year-old Jonathan Larson, who died the night before the lionized show's first preview Off-Broadway) against <m0>Noise/Funk <m0>(a musical that <m1> <m0>didn't even exist on its first day of rehearsal at Off-Broadway's Public Theater last August) in five categories: <m1> <m0>best musical, best book, best score, best actor in a musical and best lighting design.<ep>
   The deeper question, of course, is whether hidebound Broadway will actually give these noisy, revitalizing, transferred-from-downtown upstarts awards as well as nominations. <m1> <m0>Though it's true that the Tonys are reaching out to younger theater fans with a World Wide Web site (<m0>http://www.tonys.org<m0>), the awards themselves are voted on by 720 theater folk and journalists, many of whom are older (--) way, way older (--) than the target audiences for <m0>Rent <m0>and <m0>Noise/Funk<m0>.<ep>
 <m1><styl>cxon<ql>
<m2> <m2><ql>
<m0>  The rest of the competition for best musical consists of two productions that are no longer running, <m0>Chronicle of a Death Foretold <m0>and <m0>Swinging on a Star<m0>. <m1> <m0>Snubbed though eligible in that category were three musicals based on movies: <m1> <m0>Big<m0>, <m0>Victor/Victoria <m0>and <m0>State Fair<m0>.<ep>
   <m0>Rent<m0>, as it happens, is not the only Pulitzer-winning script in competi<ju>

   The Steppenwolf Theater production of Sam Shepard's <m0>Buried Child <m0>(--) winner of 1979's drama Pulitzer (--) was substantially rewritten by Shepard and is up for the best play Tony and four others; in fact, it was done Off-Broadway in 1978, and the new version represents Shepard's Broadway debut. <m1> <m0>Its strongest competition is from Terrence McNally's <m0>Master Class<m0>, followed by August Wilson's <m0>Seven Guitars <m0>(which led all plays with eight nominations) and David Hare's now-closed <m0>Racing Demon<m0>.<ep>
 <m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<m0>  The Lincoln Center Theater production of Edward Albee's 1966 Pulitzer-winning <m0>A Delicate Balance<m0>, with seven nominations, is the hot contender for best revival of a play. <m1> <m0>Two British productions (--) the Peter Hall-directed <m0>An Ideal Husband <m0>and the Royal Shakespeare Company's <m0>A Midsummer Night's Dream <m0>(--) as well as the National Actors Theatre's heralded <m0>Inherit the Wind <m0>are also nominated.<ep>
   Despite the glowing reviews for <m0>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum<m0>, that musical revival got just four nominations (including the one predicted for star Nathan Lane before the show ever opened) vs. eight for the sumptuous revival of <m0>The King and I<m0>. <m1> <m0>Their competition, long since vanished from Broadway, is <m0>Company <m0>and <m0>Hello, Dolly!<m0><ep>
   Hot individual contenders are <m0>Victor/Victoria <m0>star Julie Andrews, who has never won a Tony but is widely considered a lock for best actress in a musical; Savion Glover, up for best actor in a musical but the likely winner of the best choreographer Tony (since the best actor honor has been all but given to Lane); and Zoe Caldwell, a best actress in a play nominee for her mesmerizing Maria Callas in <m0>Master Class<m0>.<ep>
