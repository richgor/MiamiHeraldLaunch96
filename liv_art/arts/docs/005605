<m0>t's getting increasingly difficult to remember that South Florida was once considered a ``cultural wasteland.'' Consider this typical weekend for classical music buffs: Friday night, while James Judd and the Florida Philharmonic played a superbly etched Mozart <m0>Paris<m0> Symphony and a revealing Bartok <m0>Concerto for Orchestra<m0> at Gusman Center, across town Michael Tilson Thomas and the New World Symphony revived Lukas Foss' 1986 <m0>Renaissance Concerto<m0> for Flute and Orchestra and Shostakovich's Eleventh Symphony (<m0>The Year 1905<m0>), repeated Saturday.<ep>
     The remarkable thing is how brilliant (--) technically and musically (--) both orchestras sounded, and how equally perceptive Judd and Thomas were as conductors. Judd's Bartok <m1> <m0>proved exceptional. The <m0>Concerto, <m1> <m0>often spun off by major American orchestras as a dazzling showpiece for glossy virtuosity, had the sort of technical fluency you take for granted because the music-making is so interesting. Judd put a lyric, human face on this score, emphasizing its pungent Hungarian folk flavor and piquant textures.<ep>
    The slow, melancholy opening for cellos, basses, then flute and trumpets was wonderfully drawn, and when the violins came in, Judd made sure they instantly projected the imperious upthrust Bartok indicated for contrast. Phrases and transitions had the articulation and flow of eloquent, not just logical, speech. The winds in the <m0>Game of Pairs <m0>carried on astute conversation, the bursts of humor in the brasses had edge and full impact, and in the mysterious sections (--) following Bartok's instructions to the letter (--) the eerie timpani evoked the subtlest beauty.<ep>
  Judd also captured the ``just'' tempos for the <m0>Paris<m0>, with its little ``all-together-now'' first movement, and delicately shaded and juxtaposed the pert wind and string writing. But in Bruch's G minor Violin Concerto, which Jaime Laredo was originally booked to play, he was handicapped by the substitute soloist, Sergiu Schwartz, whose ripe tone and romantic flair couldn't compensate for spotty bravura technique, a messy memory lapse and far too much smeared intonation. There is a higher standard for Bruch.<ep>
  There also is a lofty standard for Foss, but the New World Symphony met it with Catherine Ransom doing a silvery, round-toned job, whizzing through this marvelously evocative music, which celebrates the spirit of earlier times without abandoning our own. This is the masterly work of an extraordinary mind. Foss' first <m2><ql>

<m0>movement is especially lovely, with jaunty harpsichord and heraldic brass. But the whole abounds in echoes of Monteverdi, punctuations of Renaissance drum, even ``whiny'' antiphonal strings and flute heard from the balcony.<ep>
  Ransom, about to become a valuable addition to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, was a spotless soloist, and the New World and Thomas took a high-spirited approach to clarifying Foss' enchantingly quaint, imaginative revelries. <ep>
  What a terrific contrast to Shostakovich's Mussorgskyian Symphony No. 11. This music secretly commemorates the 1956 Hungarian uprising, though its program relates the work to a day in 1905 when a group of workers marched to the czar's palace with a plea for help and <m1> <m0>were shot down by the palace guard.<ep>
     Thomas managed an enormously difficult task (--) keeping this huge score's somber mood from turning audiences off. The graphic ``shooting'' sequence does threaten to degenerate into sheer noise, no matter how you conduct it, and it <m0>was<m0> loud and cinematic here. But Thomas couched it within the proportions and meaning of the work, and the dark, brooding expanse of the score was clearly projected without dragging. The orchestra played like a powerhouse. It was a fascinating finale to an often-fascinating New World season.<ep>

<m0>   As Houlihan & Dancers' performance Friday at the Colony <m1> <m0>worked its way back chronologically, starting with the still-in-progress <m0>Change of Heart <m0>and ending with 1991's <m0>Between Angels<m0>, it became clear how choreographer Gerri Houlihan has changed and grown.<ep>
  There are no valentines in <m0>Heart<m0>, which, despite ironic humor, is a darkly reflective piece. More and more, Houlihan allows each movement its own rhythm and character, creating a strange clarity and elegance. The dancers (--) Ken Benjamin, Bill Doolin, Gabrielle Malone, Walter McLean, Jennifer Nugent and Pamela Pietro (--) are excellent, dancing in silence or to readings of poetry and anatomy manuals, or to Oscar Dorta's pulsing score. (Eric Fliss did the dramatic lighting.) It's sometimes very funny. In <m0>Stress Test<m0>, the dancers twitch through an abbreviated nervous breakdown while a voice reads a questionnaire that goes from practical to philosophical. In <m0>Do You???<m0> Benjamin, McLean and Nugent create hilarious physical puns. A duet for Pietro (--) wonderful here (--) and Doolin is edgy and harshly passionate. <m0>Heart <m0>feels powerful and organic, as if Houlihan dug in and faced up to some lonely conclusions.<ep>
  In <m0>til the cows come home<m0>, Pietro and Nugent play with partnering; Pietro revolves with Nugent on her shoulder, they roll up each other's bodies, waddle side by side, interdependent, challenging, curiously intimate. Now that Malone is leaving to dance with Twyla Tharp, Houlihan might have to retire the 1994 <m0>Chimera (In Your Dreams)<m0>. It's hard to imagine anyone but Malone and Doolin in this emotionally delicate, sensual duet: She floats through it as naturally as dreaming, and she and Doolin move on the same impulse, as if they felt each other in their pores.<ep>
  The gamboling <m0>Between Angels<m0>, with its exuberant sweeping circles and its coy Botticelli nymph poses, looks a little simple and self-consciously constructed now. (Nikki Rollason and Kristin O'Neal joined the other dancers, and Nugent was beautiful in what used to be Elaine Wright's solo.) But it's still a lovely, engaging dance, and an audience favorite. You can see the roots of Houlihan's original voice (--) and how far she's come.<ep>

<m0>   If you had the patience of Job you had a great time at Steve Miller Band's Saturday night concert, the second of two well-attended shows at Sunrise Musical Theatre. It's not that Miller and his excellent six-piece band didn't deliver their hits of the '70s (--) they did, aided by a superb sound system. You just had to wait.<ep>
      Miller indulged in the blues (--) his own '60s tunes and woeful nods to T-Bone Walker, Elmore James and Billie Holiday. The blues are meant to be gritty and heartfelt. Miller's vanilla voice lacks the range to convey a tortured soul; his rendition of Holiday's <m0>God Bless the Child <m0>was wholly inappropriate. Fans (--) many less than half Miller's age (he's 52) (--) seemed restless. Applause was polite.<ep>
   There were more bugs. Miller announced early that since this is an election year he'd do political songs. He began with the Vietnam-era <m0>Livin' in the U.S.A. <m0>(1968) and stayed in that period for a couple of overworked songs. You could sense a workable theme developing: He could have <m1> <m0>used <m0>The Joker <m0>for the Nixon years, 1977's <m0>Swingtown <m0>for <m1> <m0>Carter; <m0>Abracadabra <m0>for Reagan. Instead, after introducing 1986's bluesy <m0>I Want to Make the World Turn Around<m0> by saying ``We'll snuggle up to the Iron Curtain,'' he quit the theme.<ep>
   After 90 minutes, Miller finally got to his niche: His mastery of catchy pop is unquestionable (--) plunky basslines, tight guitar riffs, witty lyrics, the almighty hook, then get out fast. Here, this material (--) <m0>Wide River<m0>,<m0> Jungle Love<m0>,<m0> Jet Airliner <m0>(--) sounded fuller than on record, and had fans excited (even for a tedious 15-minute version of <m0>Fly Like an Eagle<m0>,<m0> <m0>complete with a rap written by keyboardist Joseph Wooten).<ep>
   Miller is not startingly original, but as the second 90-minute set showed, he's a craftsman who can make the familiar feel fresh.<ep>

<m0>  It was perhaps inevitable that Friday's concert at the Jackie Gleason Theater, nominally a tribute to Brazilian popular music and Antonio Carlos Jobim, would turn into a celebration of the voice.<ep>
  It couldn't have been otherwise. Despite brief appearances by the great Israel ``Cachao'' Lopez (a token gesture) and guitarist Stanley Jordan (who played one piece, left with guitar trouble and did not return), given a cast of singers that included Dori and Danilo Caymmi, Leny Andrade, Ed Motta, Dutch singer Josee Konings and Daniel Jobim, the late composer's grandson, the spotlight was on singing.<ep>
  Talent was not the problem; lack of rehearsal was. <m1> <m0>The show played like a tease (--) moments of brilliance followed by miscues (--) leaving a feeling of wanting more from these artists, especially Dori Caymmi and Motta, but in a more solid context.<ep>
   With his warm, pillow-soft baritone and relaxed delivery, Dori Caymmi brought the best out of a strong house band that included guitarist Romero Lubambo, bassist Arthur Maia and veteran percussionist Cafe. Caymmi's compact set featuring the unannounced Konings, included classic songs and originals, vocalese, and a couple of Jobim standards.<ep>
   Daniel Jobim and Danilo Caymmi proved a mismatched pair that produced predictably uneven results. Jobim sang in a conspiratorial whisper (as in the classic <m0>Waters of March<m0>) and succeeded. Caymmi belted out songs and gestured as if in a Broadway show, and did not succeed.<ep>
  Motta, a singer with a Pavarotti physique, a marvelous caramel-toned baritone and soulful delivery, went from misery to exhilaration in minutes. He did stumble at the piano at his opening, then turned around and delivered a breathtaking version of Edu Lobo's ballad <m0>Beatriz<m0>, connecting the grit and power of gospel and the lyricism of the best Brazilian pop.<ep>
   Andrade, an underrated jazz singer, got to show off her impeccable diction and phrasing even as she flirted with overstatement.<ep>

<m0>  Aterciopelados, from Colombia; Fobia, from Mexico; and Heroes del Silencio, from Spain, shared the bill Thursday at the Cameo Theater and offered an intriguing and engaging glimpse into the diversity of rock en espan~ol.<ep>
  In the opening set, Aterciopelados moved with almost palpable relish from alternative rock to <m0>musica carrilera<m0> (a low-rent popular music style from Colombia) to rancheras to a sort of punk folk gumbo. The group seems to be aiming for an ambitious, delicate balance, tempering raw power with humor, adding social commentary to good-time music, cutting and pasting Anglo rock convention and indigenous Colombian rhythms, steadily developing a tight, solid group sound but preserving loose ends and rough edges.<ep>
  Fobia, featuring surprise guest guitarist Carlos Alomar of David Bowie fame, offered a tidier approach to mixing and matching styles, more professional and pop oriented, perhaps, yet just as hard-rocking. The quintet's music, less obviously localized than, say, Aterciopelados', sounds comfortably familiar yet fresh, full of catchy hooks but spiced with quirky bits of psychedelia, perhaps a hint of dancehall, a spoonful of Tejano.<ep>
  Heroes del Silencio, a metal band from Zaragoza, Spain, that has found a following throughout Europe, closed the show with a solid set. <m1> <m0>There is little original (--) or distinctly Latin (--) in what they do. For the most part, they follow headbanging convention, from stage dress to sound. And singer Enrique Bunbury, at a distance a Jim Morrison lookalike, sings in a sort of apocalyptic belting style that brings diminishing returns. Still, for those who wanted to hear metal with lyrics in Spanish, it worked.<ep>
