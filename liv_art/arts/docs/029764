<m0>   Ninety theater critics from around the country will descend on Miami Beach's Fontainebleau Hilton <m1> <m0>Hotel Tuesday through Sunday for the 20th annual American Theatre Critics Association convention.<ep>
   On the agenda:<ep>
   (box) Margo Jefferson, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for the New York Times, will give the annual Perspectives in Criticism lecture.<ep>
   (box) A panel discussing ``Touring Theater in the '90s (--) The Money, The Art, The Risk, The Rewards'' with Richard Kornberg, press agent for <m0>Rent,  <m0>New York's hottest show at the moment; Gary McAvey, who recently put a highly acclaimed <m0>Carousel  <m0>on tour; Manny Kladitis, producer of <m0>Hello, Dolly!,  <m0>which toured in '94 with Carol Channing; and Miles Wilkin, chairman of Pace Theatrical Group, the major force in touring theater in this country.<ep>
   (box) Robert Goulet, one of America's veteran touring stars, who'll be on hand for dinner Thursday to meet and greet.<ep>
    (box) A panel discussion on ``The Pleasure and Perils of Presenting Hispanic Theater,'' with Rafael de Acha, artistic director of Coral Gables' New Theater; Mario Ernesto Sa(acu)nchez, founder of Teatro Avante; Luis Santiero, playwright for <m0>Mixed Blessings;<m0>  J.D.  Steele, artistic director of the Bridge Theater, which presents Hispanic plays; and Norma Niurka, an entertainment writer for <m1> <m0>El Nuevo Herald. Given Miami's recent controversies involving freedom of expression, this could be an event to watch.<ep>
   Critics will also see world and Florida premieres, timed especially for their arrival.<ep>
   Among them:<ep>
   <m0>(box) Passage,  <m0>by playwright Loretta Greco, a Miami Southwest Senior High grad who is now associate artistic director of the Cleveland Play House in Ohio. Directed by John Rodaz of Miami Beach's Area Stage theater, it explores the experience of Cuban rafters (Greco conducted 200 interviews, some of them in Cuba) and touches on the downing of Brothers to the Rescue planes.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Schweitzer,  <m0>written by award-winning actor Bill Yule, who'll play Albert Schweitzer at the New Theatre.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Mating Habits of the Urban Mammal,  <m0>at the Gables' Actors' Playhouse.<ep>
