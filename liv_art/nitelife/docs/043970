<m0>    <m0>(box)<m0> <m0>Mombasa Bay: <m0>3051 NE 32nd Ave., Fort Lauderdale; 565-7441. Hours: 11:30 a.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday through Friday. 11:30 a.m. to 3 <m1> <m0>a.m. Saturday. Cover: Varies<ep>
    At Mombasa Bay, it's tough to tell the locals from the tourists. Everyone looks (and acts) like they're on <m1> <m0>vacation.<ep>
    On Sundays, the club's busiest night (ladies night), it's standing <m1> <m0>room only after 9 p.m., with the indoor restaurant packed with people jamming to house band RPI. A separate, but equally raucous, party takes place on the outdoor dock, brimming with folks showing off their weekend suntans, overused pick-up lines and snazzy boats.<ep>
    Under new ownership since January, the restaurant/bar has been infused with a much-needed dose of energy. And the music likely has something to do with the upsurge. Mombasa is the only bar in the neighborhood that offers <m1> <m0>reggae nightly. The lineup includes: Tisham (with Lee Milo) on Tuesdays (also ladies night), Broken Sound <m1> <m0>Wednesday through Friday and RPI Saturday through Monday (--) all beginning at 9:30 p.m.<ep>
    Rum runners, raspberry coladas and margaritas are the favorites at the island-themed Mombasa Bay, along with Caribbean-influenced treats such as calypso chicken, conch fritters and bay shrimp. If you ever wanted to go to Jamaica, <m1> <m0>take a trip to Mombasa Bay (--) in Fort Lauderdale.<ep>
