<m0>   <m0>(box) The Kitchen Club, <m0>3701 NE Second Ave, Miami. From 11:30 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays (DJ and dancing). Cover: $7; beer, $1. Call 754-0777.<ep>
   If you want to get out of the house, go to The Kitchen.<ep>
   For years, the club has been a gathering spot for South Florida youth, <m1> <m0>where they can rebel without a cause.<ep>
   The club has called Miami Beach and the Grove its home, but is now found in the heart of the Miami Design District in the former Fire and Ice space. <ep>
   Kitchen DJs churn out the latest in industrial, New Wave, retro and progressive. So you might hear some Ministry and a little nine inch nails, along with <m1> <m0>Jane's Addiction and the Ramones.<ep>
  The garb of choice is something in black (--) be it T-shirts and jeans, long coats or dresses.<m0> <m0>If you <m1> <m0>lose your companions, good luck finding them. The club's interior is just as dark as the clothes patrons wear.<ep>
   The dance floor, in a section appropriately enough dubbed The Dark Room, is <m1> <m0>in the back of the club. <m1> <m0>Strobe lights there might help you find that missing friend (--) or discover a new one.<ql>
