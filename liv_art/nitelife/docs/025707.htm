   Saturday: Set the alarm: Rose's hosts an afternoon Mad Matinee of five bands, from 3 p.m. Tonight's pick: ``Blowout: A Hair Raiser for AIDS'' at Amnesia, from 10 p.m., with actresses Marcia Cross and Kathleen Robertson, model Tyson Beckford and vocalists Treach, Lina Santiago and Nadine Renee. Synaesthesia retro dance party in the Red Room of Virtua Cafe.

   Sunday: Gospel Brunch with Maryel Epps at Astor Place; seatings at noon and 2 p.m.; Sunday Afro Noons at Swirl by Nicky & Sherry of Afro-Maintenance (big points for wearing your 'fro); and tea dance mayhem at Amnesia. Fresh: Tea dance with Albita at Yuca on the Beach, from 6 p.m. The best nocturnal choices include Top Secret espionage music night at 821, hosted by Andrew Price Summers; the Gothic-themed Church at Groove Jet (dress code tip: black lipstick and a cape always a good idea); laid-back acid jazz at Hercules at Lua; and boyworld fun at X-Tra Large, at Liquid (Marvella presents Girlesque at 2 a.m.).

   Monday: New: Back door Bamby at Lua, with DJ Gigi. Cozy Mondays at Berlin Bar, hosted by Brigitte Andrade (tonight: diva Maryel Epps). Drag at its dizzying best: Check out Kitty Meow, Steven Gomez and Santiago ``Go Go Snack'' Pazo's supper club hit at Caffe Torino. More drag: Bridgette Buttercup and Taffy Lynn host at Swirl. Foodies should book at Ernie, Larry and Shakira's bi-weekly Chef's Table night with Chef Johnny Vinczencz at Astor Place (coming April 29: your own Queen o' the Night dons apron and chef chapeau for a '60s Flower Power-themed meal; RSVP at 534-CHEF). Fat Black Pussycat at Liquid is too important to miss, even if you have a day job. At Society Hill, open mike night (``just like in your parents' garage,'' our invite reads). More open mike at Rose's.<P>

   Tuesday: New: Jazz by candlelight at hip eatery Lure on Lincoln Road, and Gay Stand-Up night at the Comedy Zone. Also new: Betty Ford Bingo at Swirl, hosted by Marvella.

   Wednesday: New 1) Blondes Doooo Shakespeare at the Comedy Zone, produced by Sherry Faith's Method Actor's Group, featuring a cameo by Adora; 2) For a Better World, a hip-hop and reggae night, at Society Hill; 3) Secret, a dinner-show event for women only, at Caffe Torino, from 8:30 p.m.; 4) Foundation at Groove Jet, serving up grassroots jazz, funk and hip-hop. Chanteuse Lola performs at Vecchia Brera (in the Betsy Ross Hotel), from 8:30 p.m. Just when you thought it was safe to be single, Caffe Torino unleashes Shelley Novak's South Beach Singled Out; showtime: 10 p.m. At Virtua Cafe, Voodoo Lounge, with surf, twist and rare grooves by DJ Shannon and Ken; plus: hand-rolled cigars and martinis! Scratch 'n' Dent night at Swirl, where Bridgette Buttercup is let loose at the turntable. Worldbeat night at Lua. Seventies disco night at the Space.<P>

   Thursday: Claudia Heimes hosts Brazilian Nights at Lua. JaMiyla and friends celebrate Ulypian Thursdays at the Marlin Bar, from 6 p.m. The notorious foam night has returned to Amnesia; dress down. Soul 'n' more at Mark Leventhal's Funkadelica, at Bar None.<P>
