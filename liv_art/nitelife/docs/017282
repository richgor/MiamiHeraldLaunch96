<m0>t's common practice on South Beach to identify new clubs, restaurants and shops by stating what they used to be. Among locals, it takes on gamelike dimensions, as in the conversation we recently had with fellow foodie Lee Schrager.<ep>
   <m0>We:<m0> Have you been to <m0>La Villa <m0>yet, that Mediterranean restaurant on the corner of Sixth and Washington that used to <m0>Villa Pascal<m0>?<ep>
   <m0>Lee<m0>: You mean Robert's place closed? Did you ever go when it was <m0>Greenwich Village<m0>? They've got the best tableside Caesar at their restaurant in Miami. Wasn't it also some French place that was open for a week?<ep>
   <m0>We<m0>: <m0>Le Sud<m0>.<ep>
   <m0>Lee<m0>: Do you remember when it was <m0>SoBe Rotisserie<m0>?<ep>
   <m0>We<m0>: Of course, and what about when it was <m0>760<m0>, a club space, right after <m0>SoBe Rotisserie<m0> closed?<ep>
   <m0>Lee<m0>: Wasn't it a fruit stand before that?<ep>
   <m0>We<m0>: I'm sure it was.<ep>
   We could go on and on, but <m1> <m0>due to space reasons, you're spared. Maybe one especially Gothiclike day when we're really bored we'll compile a list of South Beach establishments and their past lives. That and the South Beach Family Tree we've been mulling over. And rainy-day project No. 3, <m0>South Beach: The Movie,<m0> casting notorious locals in the various roles, all of which we get to make up. Thank goodness for all this great weather, right?<ep>
   Speaking of what things used to be, have you been to <m0>Pop<m0>, the fabulous new retro shop at 12th and Washington, right across from <m0>Ultraviolet<m0>, which used to be<m0> Meet Me in Miami<m0> (before Meet Me moved two spaces down the block), which used to be <m0>Baci di Roma<m0>, which used to be an antique mall of sorts for five minutes, which at one time used to be <m0>Kress 5 & 10<m0>?<ep>
  <m0>Pop<m0> is South Beach's new emporium of high kitsch, picking up where the much-loved <m0>Flashbacks<m0> closed shop a few storefronts away last October. Owned and operated by the admittedly eccentric young <m0>Harold Golen<m0>, a freelance designer and graduate of the University of Miami architecture school, Pop stocks a cozy assortment of vintage collectibles and toys, plus some new clothing from mod local designers. ``Tomorrowland meets '50s modern'' is how Golen describes his new retail funhouse, which is decorated with colorful, molecularesque objects covered in lots of glitter and things from Golen's house that no longer fit, such as a yellow, red and aqua <m0>Arquitectonica<m0>-designed dining room table. <m1>   <ep>
<m0>   We naturally gravitated toward the Barbie display corner, a cartoonish vanity area coated in (--) what else? (--) gold glitter. In addition to original <m0>Barbies, Kens, Midges<m0> and <m0>Skippers<m0>, Pop's got all the fun accessory items, including the original Barbie Vanity Set (three pieces of red-velvet-``upholstered'' furniture, a little tissue box, mirror, the requisite framed photo of Ken and one of Ken's jock trophies to reinforce Barbie's femininity). We very much like the fact that Pop maintains vampire hours (--) noon till 11 p.m. (--) seven days a week.<ep>
   In addition to Pop, a new Beach spot to investigate is <m0>Radiance<m0>, a center for yoga and the healing arts, at 435 Espan~ola Way, in the space that used to be the <m0>Scharf Schop<m0>. Artist <m0>Kenny Scharf<m0>'s wife <m0>Tereza <m0>is the quiet force behind Radiance, which offers classes in yoga, Pilates, Tai Chi and, occasionally, belly dancing. All the wild Scharf wall doodles are gone, replaced by tranquil deep purples and greens which, coincidentally, were all over the runways at the fall '96 collections in New York. <ep>
   There were a number of brilliant parties and events last week, including:<ep>
   (box) The Chanel reception to honor <m0>NFAA<m0>, the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts, a Miami-based national foundation that obtains funds for artistically gifted high school students. Held at one of North Bay Road's grand estates, the sweeping bayfront veranda at sunset was the best site for cocktails, ever. Lots of glamorous philanthropists checking out the Chanel Joaillerie displays.<ep>
   (box) Music impresario <m0>Desmond Child<m0>'s paella fest on La Gorce Island to honor legendary producers, including <m0>Tom Dowd, Phil Ramone <m0>and <m0>Nick Martinelli<m0>, in Miami for a NARAS (National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences) event. Roaming about the hacienda's Mexican-tiled courtyard were songwriter <m0>Mark Hudson<m0> (the former Hudson Brother wrote <m0>Aerosmith<m0>'s <m0>Livin' on the Edge<m0>), Aerosmith lead singer <m0>Steven Tyler<m0> with wife <m0>Theresa<m0> (Steven's currently recording in Miami, with September as the working release date for the new Aerosmith CD) and manager-to-the-stars <m0>C. Winston Simone<m0>, one of the last remaining straight men who prefers books to skiing and finds sports in general entirely overrated. This we admire.<ep>
   More fluff 'n' stuff next week. Peace.<ep>
