<m0>(box) Baja Beach Club, <m0>3015 Grand Ave. (Cocowalk), Coconut Grove. From 9 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. Wednesdays through Sundays; 445-5499. DJ and dancing. Cover varies. <ep>
   It's the party that never ended. Baja Beach Club serves up a Spring Break's worth of fun each night, year-round.<ep>
 Sorry, no pool or volleyball nets here. But night crawlers will find bikini-clad waitresses and brawny bartenders serving at a clubber's beck and call. <ep>
 DJs blast an eclectic mix of disco, hip-hop and techno tunes to collegians, dating couples and a crush of Yuppie singles who line up to rock and roll, drink and dance, and just party, party, party. Baja gets so jammed that the line starts at the door, spills down the staircase and stretches to the other side of Cocowalk. It looks like one giant conga line waiting to roll into motion.<ep>
   On Saturdays, Power 96 (WPOW 96.5 FM) stops by and broadcasts live from the club. Revelers hear tunes such as the Goodmen's <m0>Give it Up  <m0>or the Real McCoy's <m0>Automatic Lover.<m0>  <m1> <m0>You don't have to dance to have a good time.<ep>
 Baja houses everything from pool tables to video games. But people-watching seems to be the club's main sport, whether partiers are checking out the bar girls, the bar boys, the bartenders or the barflies.<ep>
