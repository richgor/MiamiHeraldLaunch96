<m0>      Gary's has most of what you would expect from a sports bar (--) pool tables, satellite television, dozens of domestic beers, live music, huge bars (--) but what makes it unusual is that it's tucked inside a large bowling alley (University Bowl). So if you get a midnight craving for beer and bowling, you can do both here.<ep>
        On Saturdays, crowds come to hearnationally known artists (granted, some are oldies), such as Survivor, Atlanta Rhythm Section, Flock of Seagulls.<ep>
        Other nightly lineups include karaoke on Mondays (bar tabs a prize), battle of the local bands on Wednesdays (four local bands compete), ladies night on Thursdays (ladies drink free from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.) and live music on Fridays (usually, local rock and alternative bands) and Saturdays.<ep>
      A smooth pair of legs can be a lucrative asset here. On Thursday nights, the woman who wins takes home $300. To make the evening appeal to both sexes, Gary's hot legs contest is followed by a male revue.<ep>
   If Davie is not in your usual destination, Gary's Sports Bar & Grille has a second spot at 2200 N. Federal Hwy. in Pompano Beach (954-782-6340). The Pompano Beach location also offers bowling, but venue varies from the Davie one.<ql>
