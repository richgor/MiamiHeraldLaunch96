E<BR>
veryone's so preoccupied with AIDS these days that we seem to have forgotten all about the prospect that used to terrify couples: What if you get pregnant? <P>

   Whether you've been seeing each other two weeks, two months or two years, a pregnancy can smother a courtship. It can lead to your relationship's destruction -- or it can help bring you closer.<P>

   ``Lynn,'' a 40-year-old senior financial analyst, had been seeing her boyfriend for two months when she got pregnant. When she told him, she got another shock. He told her he had a wife in the Dominican Republic.<P>

   ``My position was, `I'm too old for this bull,' '' she says. ``I had a good job, I had saved up money. I basically said I'd do it without him. So I got rid of him. I said I didn't want anything to do with him.''<P>

   So she and her parents now share the rearing of her son, who's 5 1/2 years old.<P>

   A relationship doesn't have to be the casualty of a pregnancy.<P>

   ``I use the expression, `Stay centered,' '' says Lani Kaskel, a marriage and family therapist in Kendall who sometimes deals with unexpected pregnancies. ``Think clearly about what each wants to do.''<P>

   Some couples decide to stay together and raise the baby. Some work together to arrange for an adoption. The first thought for many is abortion, but Kaskel tells women that's not a decision to be made under pressure.<P>

   ``When a woman has gone ahead and had an abortion at the insistence or persuasion of the male, oftentimes there's a lot of repercussions in terms of guilt, a sense of remorse, wishing she hadn't done that,'' Kaskel says.<P>

Taking sides<P>

   Whether to go ahead and have the child can be a powerful point of division. I know of one man who talked about suing his girlfriend because she had an abortion against his wishes. (They've since married and had children.) And sometimes men get angry because a woman refuses to have an abortion, believing she's trying to trap them.<P>

   Yes, there are misguided women who will use a pregnancy to try to force a commitment. And there are others who won't get an abortion because of their beliefs, or because they simply don't want to, say, because they hear their biological clock ticking.<P>

   Of course, just as women can feel helpless in a situation like this, so can men.<P>

   ``Once a woman is pregnant, it's out of your hands. Now, your whole life is in her hands, and there's nothing you can do about it,'' says ``Teighlor,'' 32, a Miami federal government employee.<P>

   He has a 3-year-old daughter with a Georgia woman with whom he had a fling while in school.<P>

   ``Believe me, I've kicked myself a million times. I've dealt with the issues: `What were you thinking?' My thing is that, when this first happened to me, there was no question about my responsibilities . . . I told her, `Whatever you need, let me know.' ''<P>

   Except getting married, he told her.<P>

   Is he a jerk? No. Maybe he's just a realist, having been divorced once.<P>

   Unless you have a strong foundation as a couple -- and you're not just infatuated or romanticizing the nobility of ``doing the right thing'' -- marriage should not  be an option for handling a pregnancy, says Kaskel.<P>

   ``Certainly, a couple wouldn't want to marry for the sake of having a baby,'' she says. ``They haven't begun to bond with one another.''<P>

Happily ever after?<BR>
   <P>

   That's something that ``Alexis,'' a 32-year-old writer who lives in South Dade, says she learned the hard way. When she got pregnant with her son, who's now 7, she decided to marry his father -- even though she'd broken off their engagement soon before she knew she was pregnant. They'd been seeing each other for a year.<P>

   ``He really wanted to be married and stay with me and work things out,'' Alexis says. ``I guess I believed if I did have the child, then it would bring out the best in the relationship and we'd both have something to work toward. People believe if you bring children into the relationship, it'll bring you closer, and it didn't work that way at all.''<P>

   The marriage fell apart when her son was almost 2. Then, the court battles began.<P>

   ``Do as much as you can to protect yourself,'' she says, ``because bringing a child into the world is a lot more difficult than I ever imagined it to be. If I could turn back time, I truly believe I would have waited and had a child with someone I had something stronger with.''<P>

   Sure, there are countless examples of couples who did marry after a pregnancy and things worked out fine. Chances are, those couples probably could have gotten married regardless.<P>

Decision is permanent<P>

   Even if you don't get married, the decision to have a child is permanent. You may not always be romantically involved, but you are that child's parents. Both of you. Always.<P>

   Teighlor says he knows he hasn't done everything he could do, but he's tried to be a father. He was there when his child was born. He sends mother and child a check every two weeks. He talks to his daughter on the phone. Still, when he asked to take her for a few days so she could meet her grandfather, her mother refused.<P>

   Eventually, he says, he'll have to go to court to fight for his rights as a father. He'll fight if he has to, he says, remembering how he never met his own father until he was 22.<P>

   A pregnancy is such an easy biological accident. How often does infatuation make us foolhardy? Or eagerness make us careless?<P>

   It only needs to happen once.
