e's Dr. Dad. His TV parenting programs and columns for Parents magazine and The New York Times have made him a household name.<P>

  ``What I do,'' Lawrence Kutner explains, ``I can't quite describe.'' Then he does: ``I try to help parents get inside their children's heads.''<P>

   He'll bring that philosophy with him Sunday as the keynote speaker at the Second Annual Parenting Conference at the Alper Jewish Community Center in Kendall. He'll also bring his new book, Your School-Age Child (William Morrow & Co., $20), the third entry in his four-part Parent & Child series. The book, writes Publishers Weekly, ``places him in the pantheon occupied by Spock, Brazelton and Leach.''<P>

   In his talks and in his writing, Kutner, 44, and father of a 6-year-old son, deals with a myriad of issues: from parents' frustrations to the reasons behind sibling rivalry and why a fear of monsters under the bed is a good sign. By using lots of anecdotes and simple advice -- give the child a spray bottle against monsters -- he navigates tough terrain. He believes a good parent must, above all, be educated to understand why a child behaves the way he does.<P>

  ``The parents who are the most frustrated, the most overwhelmed are the ones who don't understand the normal development of childhood. It's much easier to deal with a child once you understand why he's doing what he's doing,'' he adds.<P>

  Kutner's work is not a how-to manual. Rather, he offers parents an explanation that enhances their understanding of children's behavior. Primarily, he wants to prevent communication problems. He wants to assure parents they are not alone.<P>

  ``Parents should get their backs patted more. They should give themselves credit. You don't have to be perfect all the time,'' he explains.<P>

  Kutner's common sense advice is wonderfully quotable:<P>

  <LI> ``The ultimate goal of parenting is to change your line of business. It's not putting you out of business. You're still a parent when the child is 23, but you don't parent as if the child was 3.''<P>

  <LI> ``There's this spun-glass theory about childhood and about how children can be irreparably harmed. While there are some extremes, such as physical and sexual abuse, a child can usually recover from parents' mistakes. A friend says God gives every parent 20,000 mistakes before you need a refill. I agree.''<P>

  <LI> ``Most important lesson I've been taught is humility. Just when I think I know everything, my son or another kid will put me in my place.''<P>

  <LI> ``What I really didn't get until I had my own son -- at least not at the gut level -- was how terribly exhausting that first year is. And I had it easy. My wife and I had tag team parenting.''<P>

  But for all his upbeat advice, Kutner admits to worrying about the family unit in the latter part of this century. He is a baby boomer who grew up in New York City, the adopted son of a landlord and a union organizer. His mother was a high-school dropout and his father had only a high school education, but he was always encouraged to take advantage of opportunities and emphasize his studies.<P>

   It was while studying clinical psychology in graduate school, in fact, where he got his start. Frustrated with the way the media treated science, he worked with the documentary unit of a television station one summer. From there, he became science editor for a public television station in New York, which convinced him what he had to do: Develop a public health/psychology practice that uses mass media to get the word out.<P>

  His message: The families of today are ``profoundly different.'' Higher divorce rates, more single parents, more working moms and weakened support systems make raising children tougher than ever.<P>

  ``Parents no longer get the friendly advice, the sense of perspective a grandmother or family member used to give the new mother or father. I think that's the overwhelming issue in our lives,'' he explains.<P>

   Kutner, who now teaches at Harvard Medical School, is an advocate of what he calls ``informal cooperatives'' -- parents helping other parents not only by giving advice but also with a myriad of other child-care responsibilities. This is also how he sees his mission -- as part of this far-ranging informal cooperative, as a translator and bridge maker.<P>

  ``There's a tremendous amount of information out there that parents don't have access to,'' he says. ``And even if they did, it would be in psychobabble. I want to make cutting edge research accessible to them.''<P>
