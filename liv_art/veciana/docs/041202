<m0>e's Dr. Dad. His TV parenting programs and columns for Parents magazine and The New York Times have made him a household name.<ep>
  ``What I do,'' Lawrence Kutner explains, ``I can't quite describe.'' Then he does: ``I try to help parents get inside their children's heads.''<ep>
   He'll bring that philosophy with him Sunday as the keynote speaker at the Second Annual Parenting Conference at the Alper Jewish Community Center in Kendall. He'll also bring his new book, <m0>Your School-Age Child <m0>(William Morrow & Co., $20), the third entry in his four-part Parent & Child series. The book, writes Publishers Weekly, ``places him in the pantheon occupied by Spock, Brazelton and Leach.''<ep>
   In his talks and in his writing, Kutner, 44, and father of a 6-year-old son, deals with a myriad of issues: from parents' frustrations to the reasons behind sibling rivalry and why a fear of monsters under the bed is a good sign. By using lots of anecdotes and simple advice (--) give the child a spray bottle against monsters (--) he navigates tough terrain. He believes a good parent must, above all, be educated to understand <m0>why<m0> a child behaves the way he does.<ep>
  ``The parents who are the most frustrated, the most overwhelmed are the ones who don't understand the normal development of childhood. It's much easier to deal with a child once you understand why he's doing what he's doing,'' he adds.<ep>
  Kutner's work is not a how-to manual. Rather, he offers parents an explanation <m2><ql>

<m0>that enhances their understanding of children's behavior. Primarily, he wants to prevent communication problems. He wants to assure parents they are not alone.<ep>
  ``Parents should get their backs patted more. They should give themselves credit. You don't have to be perfect all the time,'' he explains.<ep>
  Kutner's common sense advice is wonderfully quotable:<ep>
  (box) ``The ultimate goal of parenting is to change your line of business. It's not putting you out of business. You're still a parent when the child is 23, but you don't parent as if the child was 3.''<ep>
  (box) ``There's this spun-glass theory about childhood and about how children can be irreparably harmed. While there are some extremes, such as physical and sexual abuse, a child can usually recover from parents' mistakes. A friend says God gives every parent 20,000 mistakes before you need a refill. I agree.''<ep>
  (box) ``Most important lesson I've been taught is humility. Just when I think I know everything, my son or another kid will put me in my place.''<ep>
  (box) ``What I really didn't get until I had my own son (--) at least not at the gut level (--) was how terribly exhausting that first year is. And I had it easy. My wife and I had tag team parenting.''<ep>
  But for all his upbeat advice, Kutner admits to worrying about the family unit in the latter part of this century. He is a baby boomer who grew up in New York City, the adopted son of a landlord and a union organizer. His mother was a high-school dropout and his father had only a high school education, but he was always encouraged to take advantage of opportunities and emphasize his studies.<ep>
<m1>Get the word out<ep>
<m0>   It was while studying clinical psychology in graduate school, in fact, where he got his start. Frustrated with the way the media treated science, he worked with the documentary unit of a television station one summer. From there, he became science editor for a public television station in New York, which convinced him what he had to do: Develop a public health/psychology practice that uses mass media to get the word out.<ep>
  His message: The families of today are ``profoundly different.'' Higher divorce rates, more single parents, more working moms and weakened support systems make raising children tougher than ever.<ep>
  ``Parents no longer get the friendly advice, the sense of perspective a grandmother or family member used to give the new mother or father. I think that's the overwhelming issue in our lives,'' he explains.<ep>
<m1>Parents helping parents<ep>
<m0>   Kutner, who now teaches at Harvard Medical School, is an advocate of what he calls ``informal cooperatives'' (--) parents helping other parents not only by giving advice but also with a myriad of other child-care responsibilities. This is also how he sees his mission (--) as part of this far-ranging informal cooperative, as a translator and bridge maker.<ep>
  ``There's a tremendous amount of information out there that parents don't have access to,'' he says. ``And even if they did, it would be in psychobabble. I want to make cutting edge research accessible to them.''<ep>
