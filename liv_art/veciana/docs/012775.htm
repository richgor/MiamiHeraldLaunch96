are is the mother who, upon leaving her baby at day care, doesn't feel a pang of guilt. Depending on our interest in work and our relationship with our children, that pang can pack a walloping punch or merely twinge momentarily.<P>

  ``I knew my son was going to be OK,'' recalls Barbara Garvine, a teacher who returned to work shortly after her son, now 6, was born. ``But I also used to have this feeling in my stomach that I should be the one doing it for him, that nobody could do it as well as I could. There definitely was the guilt.''<P>

  Trudging off to the office or the factory, the store or the backroom, we mothers are torn between guilt and necessity. For many, Mom's job is vital to the family's economic well-being. For others, the job is an important source of self-esteem and satisfaction.<P>

  ``I think we all have this ambivalent feeling, whether we need the job or not,'' explains Susan Lichtman, a businesswoman and Kendall mother of two. ``On one hand, you wish you could be there with your children. Then on the other side, you know you can't for whatever reason.''<P>

  The embers of working mother's guilt have been stoked as much by our own feelings as by research and experts who said staying at home with infants was the only way to nurture that one-to-one bonding. With more than half the mothers of young children now employed, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, this debate, often strident, always emotional, gave pause to a nation full of nervous parents.<P>

  Now, a new, comprehensive report may allay the fears of parents of young children. The five-year study of 1,300 families nationwide concluded that infants' trust in their mothers is not compromised by day care -- as long as a mother is sensitive and responsive to her child.<P>

  The report, conducted by researchers for the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, surely must have prompted a collective sigh of relief. It runs counter to earlier research that seemed to show that babies in child care were slightly more likely to have an insecure relationship with their mothers than those whose mothers stayed at home.<P>

  Needless to say, these old studies alarmed parents, particularly those who had no choice. But this recent report, considered the most far-reaching and comprehensive to date, is being touted as a form of vindication for many mothers who have seen their children thrive in day care.<P>

   Jeannie Jontiff, an attorney and mother of a 2-year-old and an 8-month-old, had ``reservations'' about putting Lauren, her eldest, in child care when she was a month old. But when she placed Matthew at a center when he was 3 months old, she harbored no second thoughts. Both children attend Carol Center in downtown Miami, a child care center that prides itself in activities for children of all ages.<P>

  ``So much has to do with the confidence in the people you leave them with,'' says Jontiff, who lives in Morningside. ``I saw how well Lauren did. She's very independent, very adaptable, so I didn't feel guilty with Matthew. I leave him and he's smiling.''<P>

  Other mothers said the report boosted their confidence and proved what they had been saying all along. Harriet Kamerow of Plantation left both her children -- now 11 and 14 -- in day care when they were infants. As a single parent who had to work, she had no choice, but did have enough guilt to go around. Her children's progress, however, stilled her concerns.<P>

   ``It's nice to see the study, though it's a little late for me,'' Kamerow jokes. ``I think, though, that it will help other mothers, especially the ones who have to work and must put their children in day care.''<P>

  For most mothers, instinct is really the final word. No study, whether critical or approving, can change strong feelings of wanting to stay home or wanting to return to work.<P>

  ``It is so individual,'' says Donna Fuhrmann, a Kendall mother of two girls. ``Each child is different and they will do differently in situations. You have to judge by your own experience.''<P>

  Fuhrmann chose to cut back on her work hours to spend more time with her eldest daughter. Though both girls had been in day care since they were 6 months old, the youngest, now 3, adapted more easily than the oldest.<P>

  Like other mothers, Fuhrmann believes it is the quality of day care that makes all the difference. Top-notch care, more than anything else, helps allay parents' guilt.<P>

   The recent study agrees. Researchers concluded that some aspects of child care appeared to pose risks for vulnerable children. If a mother is not responsive or sensitive to her child's needs, then poor day care, changes of day care several times, or spending more than 10 hours a week in a day-care center can exacerbate the problems in the relationship. However, if the relationship between mother and child is good, the number of hours in day care makes no difference.<P>

  ``Children are very resilient and they can come back from so much,'' says Garvine, the teacher. ``But we want to be sure they're getting the best when we're not there.''
