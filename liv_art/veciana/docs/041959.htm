<B><FONT SIZE=+3>    W</FONT></B>hen Robin Kaye Stilwell first began counseling families as a therapist 20 years ago, couples were trying to figure out how to communicate more with each other.<P>

  ``We don't talk to each other anymore,'' the wife would complain.<P>

  ``I don't understand her problem,'' the husband would reply.<P>

  Communication is still a concern for the families of the late 1990s, but the people who walk into the offices of marriage and family therapists have changed. More and more, they reflect the transformations of society outside the clinic doors.<P>

  ``We're seeing more same-sex couples, more blended families, more single parents,'' says Stilwell. ``Many of the problems have remained the same, but the people who are seeking help are more diverse.''<P>

  As president-elect of the Florida Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, Stilwell will preside over the group's annual convention in Miami Beach next week. The three-day conference, beginning Thursday, seeks to mirror the changes members have witnessed in their practices. Among the sessions: Violence in Gay and Lesbian Couples, A School-Based Collaborative Systems Approach in a Haitian Community, Domestic Violence -- Identification and Treatment.<P>

  These changes are true in large cities such as Miami as well as in smaller towns. Andres Nazario Jr., a Cuba-born, Miami-raised family therapist now practicing in Central Florida, notes that an increasing number of his patients are trying to make sense of what seems an ever-confusing world.<P>

  On one hand, he says, ``there are more women questioning their relationships.'' On the other, he has noticed ``more interest by fathers in the lives of their children, in raising their children.''<P>

   These are healthy changes. But the support system to ease the adjustment has been weakened by the mobility and disintegration of families.<P>

  ``There are fewer extended family members around to help,'' says Nazario, current president of the Florida association. ``Couples need and seek more outside resources.''<P>

   As a result, the business of marriage and family therapy is, if not booming, at least growing at a brisk pace.<P>

   ``There are more and more jobs for our graduates,'' says Anne Rambo, director of the master's degree program in the Department of Family Therapy at Nova Southeastern University in Davie. ``We've seen the field grow since we began offering the degree seven years ago.''<P>

  Yet, with such growth have come constraints from insurance companies. While more people may be visiting their local therapists, chances are the number of visits may be fewer, as insurers vow to keep medical costs down.<P>

  ``Insurance companies,'' says Stilwell, ``are looking for symptom reduction, not necessarily a cure. With fewer sessions, you gear more for problem-solving instead of getting to the deep-rooted problems. The longer one goes, the deeper the changes.''<P>

  Other changes therapists have noted:<P>

  <LI> More men are willing to come in for therapy, but women still remain the partner who suggests treatment or begins it alone. ``Women typically are the relationship-keepers,'' Stilwell says. ``They're more geared to talking about what they want if they're not getting it from a relationship.''<P>

  <LI> When men do come, their conversations seem familiar: ``Don't feel like we have fun anymore. As soon as I walk in the door, she's telling me what to do.'' Or, ``Part of me doesn't want to come home anymore.'' Or, ``We've grown apart. I don't know what happened to us. We got lost in the kids, our careers . . . ''<P>

  <LI> Everyone seems more stressed, more isolated. ``People feel more pressured than ever before,'' says Wendy Joffe, a licensed marriage and family therapist in South Miami. ``Whether it's true or not, they feel life has become much more frenetic. People seem to have trouble keeping their center. After 26 years [in this business], I don't think we've really figured out how to manage it all.''<P>

  <LI> Other therapists say couples want a mediator to help them figure out how to divide child care, housework and other responsibilities. They want to know how they can carve out more time to be together. ``In the past 20 years, there has been a tremendous change in expectations of each other,'' Rambo says. ``Couples want to balance personal happiness with a responsibility to the other person and the children.''<P>

  <LI> Cases of domestic violence seem to be more common, but therapists warn that this doesn't mean an increase overall. Says Nazario: ``I don't think there's necessarily more domestic violence, but more a willingness to recognize it as a problem.''<P>

  <LI> Parents' problems with children seem increasingly to stem from their inability to set boundaries or for both parents to agree on a course of discipline. ``Couples have trouble sitting down and coming up with parameters for their children,'' says Joffe.
