   Forget that Vinnie Terranova is supposed to be <m1> <m0>dead.<ep>
   <m0>Wiseguy  <m0>fans won't recognize either the actor (Ken Wahl) who plays the deep-cover FBI agent, or the action (--) a far cry from the series' tightly wound drama (--) in tonight's TV movie based on the '80s cult hit.<ep>
   That's partly because Wahl has gained so much weight since he left the show in 1990 that he's barely recognizable. (Never mind that his character was putatively killed off by a Salvadoran death squad.) And partly because it's impossible to pack the complexity or grace of <m0>Wiseguy's  <m0>trademark plot arcs into a two-hour TV movie format.<ep>
   Vinnie has been resurrected to infiltrate a high-tech computer company run by an ex-mobster (--) and to revive Wahl's career, with the promise of more such <m0>Wiseguy  <m0>projects if this one succeeds. (He has also moved from CBS, home of the series, to ABC.) <ep>
    He reunites with bespectacled former boss Frank McPike (Jonathan Banks), as well as the Lifeguard (Jim Byrnes), his contact when he's undercover. As is his habit, he falls for Emma Callednar (Debrah Farentino), the beautiful wife of the crooked high-tech executive, while becoming a surrogate father to her lonely son.<ep>
   Despite covering the basics of the <m0>Wiseguy  <m0>formula (--) replete with balletic gunplay and nifty pyrotechnics (--) the TV movie features all of the series' weak points and none of its strengths. Especially lacking is the luxury of watching a story unfold over six or seven hours, to say nothing of background detail and character development.<ep>
   If you're expecting anything like the series' twisted sense of humor, its menagerie of bizarre villains or the political savvy that embraced everything from Beowulf to the Iran-Contra affair, you'll be bitterly disappointed. In its place is Banks' constant scenery-munching and Wahl's apparent desire to be somewhere else. <ep>
   After an hour of this <m0>Wiseguy, <m0>you'll wish you were somewhere else, too.<ql>
