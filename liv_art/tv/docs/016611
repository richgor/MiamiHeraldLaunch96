<m0>   Hell hath no fury like a celluloid diva tossed out like last week's leftovers.<ep>
   Michael Douglas learned it when he cut ties with Glenn Close in <m0>Fatal Attraction,<m0>  and, for that matter, with Demi Moore in <m0>Disclosure.<m0>  When Clint Eastwood tried to straddle the fence with a pair of Southern schoolmarms in <m0>The Beguiled,<m0>  he paid a heavy price.<ep>
   And Sunday night Tim Matheson learns the lesson, too, courtesy of Jennie Garth in ABC's <m0>The Unfinished Affair.<m0> <ep>
   Once scorned, Garth's crafty character plots a near-perfect revenge on the lover who leaves her, systematically breaking down his personal and professional lives.<ep>
   ``I had a good time with it,'' she says of the telefilm. ``It's a good story with no hidden messages. It's a thriller, a suspenser. Pure entertainment.''<ep>
   And, adds the veteran of Fox's long-running <m0>Beverly Hills, 90210<m0>:  ``It's always fun to play the bad girl. . . . It gets kind of boring to be nice, you know?''<ep>
   Also, despite her character's continual Machiavellian maneuverings, Garth doesn't consider her to be evil.<ep>
   ``She's not sociopathic at all, she's just. . .'' Garth pauses, ``. . . upset.''<ep>
   <m0>Affair<m0>  has added appeal for the actress, as it's the third film she's helped produce under her Blue Puddle Productions. The added title of producer, Garth says, gives her a say in the hiring of writers, directors and actors, as well as the overall feel of the film.<ep>
   At this point in her career, having played the same character so long on TV, Garth is in search of a wide variety of projects. ``I like strong women (--) I like women who don't have to say a lot to get a point across. Women with a lot of heart and soul,'' she says.<ep>
   Unfortunately, those scripts are few and far between.<ep>
   As far as her future with <m0>Beverly Hills, 90210,<m0>  which begins shooting its seventh season in July, Garth has one more year on her contract. After that, she's not sure what's in store.<ep>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen,'' she admits. ``There's a part of me that wants to move on. But it's a good job, and people love the show. I would miss it a great deal.''<ql>
