<m0>r. T, meet Jim Profit.<ep>
   Neither T's Mohawk haircut nor Profit's Brooks Brothers suits entirely define the fervid imagination of TV impresario Stephen J. Cannell, who fathered both characters.<ep>
   Television's answer to Charles Dickens, he has created, produced or written more than his share of potboilers, from classics <m0>(Mission Impossible, The Rockford Files)<m0>  to lowbrow hits <m0>(The A-Team, 21 Jump Street)<m0>  to crowd-pleasers <m0>(The Commish, Hunter)<m0>  and cult phenomena <m1> <m0>(Wiseguy).<m0> To say nothing of such short-lived wonders as <m0>Missing Persons, Sonny Spoon  <m0>and <m0>The Hat Squad, <m0>or the cable-based adult crime series <m0>Silk Stalkings. <m0><ep>
   Cannell's latest (--) a sharp contrast to his campy '70s hit <m0>The A-Team <m0>(--) is <m0>Profit, <m0>which chronicles the misadventures of an executive at a Fortune 100 company. It was just launched as a midseason replacement on Fox, where its ratings haven't been as high as the buzz on it: It's about a guy who grew up inside a large cardboard box to become a scheming businessman and an executive's worst nightmare.<ep>
    Meanwhile one of Cannell's most celebrated shows, <m0>Wiseguy <m0> (--) which also explored the darker corners of male bonding (--) returns as a TV movie tonight.<ep>
   En route to a meeting in Los Angeles, Cannell talked on his car phone about why he's bringing back <m0>Wiseguy  <m0>and how, with <m0>Profit,  <m0>he came to produce a TV show centered around a sociopath.<ep>
   ``What happened in the case of <m0>Wiseguy, <m0>Ken Wahl came by my office one day and said `If you ever want to do <m0>Wiseguy  <m0>as a movie. . . .' CBS [which originally aired the series from 1987 <m2><ql>

CANNELL,  FROM  1F<ql>
<m0>to 1990] was lukewarm. The second place we went was ABC. [Entertainment president] Ted Harbert and others were big fans of the show when <m0>Wiseguy  <m0>was on the air. So we pitched it and they said, `Yeah, absolutely.' ''<ep>
   Thus Vinnie Terranova returns to the TV screen, where tonight he infiltrates an unsavory high-tech company. In case you're wondering whether Cannell thinks <m0>Wiseguy'<m0>s<m0>  <m0>savvy fans will buy his comeback when Terranova's character was supposedly killed off, Cannell says, ``He was never really dead. We left it where you could think that (--) or think it was part of his cover.'' <ep>
<m1>Project to grow<ep>
<m0>   Whatever you think, Cannell is hoping you watch. Behind the idea in reviving the show is Cannell's wish that <m0>Wiseguy  <m0>become a regularly appearing TV movie, along the lines of <m0>The Rockford Files.  <m0>Although tonight's project was written by Cannell lieutenant Joel Surnow, the producer says, ``I would love to write one.''<ep>
   The critical problem is how to get Vinnie into the '90s. One of the show's charms was its uncanny ability to pinpoint a real-life social or political phenomenon almost minutes before it actually happened.<ep>
    ``Off the top of my head,'' says Cannell, ``I haven't got [another storyline]. We would sit down and explore what would be an interesting place to go with Vinnie Terranova. I'm not saying we would want to do a militia plot, but certainly infiltrating a militia is something a federal agent might do.''<ep>
   In the meantime, in addition to producing <m0>Profit,  <m0>Cannell has finished writing his second novel (--) not a bad year for a guy who's dyslexic. (A cyberthriller called <m0>Final Victim, <m0>it will be published by William Morrow in July.) And he's got two more drama pilots in the pipes, ``one for UPN about aliens, and another drama for WB about a disabled police officer.''<ep>
<m1>Love the weird<ep>
<m0>   Cannell admits to a fascination with weird human behavior, but says the main appeal of <m0>Profit <m0> was a chance to ``turn the storytelling convention upside down, to put the bad guy in the center and be rooting against him instead of for him.<ep>
   ``I'm fascinated by evil intent. Like a cobra in a basket, you're always waiting for him to strike.''<ep>
   What's biting Cannell, however, are some recent mumblings about <m0>Profit  <m0>being anti-business. He appeared on CNBC just after the show premiered to discuss whether the show indulges in ``executive-bashing.'' His response: ``I don't think anyone thought it was a very legitimate complaint.<ep>
   ``These guys make a million dollars a year,'' Cannell says, ``and they go and bawl about this. That's silly.''<ql>
