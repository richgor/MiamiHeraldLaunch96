<m0>   NEW YORK (--) How vividly Tom Brokaw remembers May 2, 1966, as he drove onto the NBC lot in Burbank, Calif. His first day on the job.<ep>
   ``I was 26 years old, and my wife Meredith and I had just had our first baby. Four years earlier we'd been in Yankton, S.D., <m4>Brokaw<m2><ql>
<m0>with not many prospects and no money.<ep>
   ``I thought, `Oh, my God! Here we are!' ''<ep>
   As news anchor at KNBC, the network-owned station that serves the huge Los Angeles audience, Brokaw had begun what today he marks as 30 years with NBC. And, indeed, it was only the beginning.<ep>
   In 1973, he was tapped as NBC News' White House correspondent.<ep>
   In 1976, he moved to New York to be anchor of <m0>Today.<m0> <ep>
   In 1982, he was named co-anchor of <m0>NBC Nightly News<m0>  with Roger Mudd, and then, in September 1983, he became solo anchor. Almost 13 years later, he still is.<ep>
   A pair of table lamps softly lights Brokaw's office at NBC's Rockefeller Center headquarters. At his desk, Brokaw nurses a double cappuccino from the coffee bar downstairs and works, this day, to the hits of Lieber and Stoller: <m0>Poison Ivy,<m0> <m0>Stand by Me,<m0> <m0>Jailhouse Rock.<m0> <ep>
   ``The beginning of rock 'n' roll,'' he says grandly.<ep>
   Back in Yankton in the 1950s, Brokaw was known to sport a ducktail cut and white bucks, and he thought Elvis represented, in a word, ``deliverance.''<ep>
<m1>`Be at ease'<ep>
<m0>   After high school basketball practice, he worked as disc jockey and newsman at the radio station that had just signed on, ``and I learned at an early age to be at ease on the air.''<ep>
   It shows. Brokaw still makes it look easy, ad-libbing on a breaking story for what can stretch for hours (``an almost out-of-body experience,'' he describes it, ``but the key is preparation'').<ep>
   Even more remarkably, he has made it look easy as he rode the precipitous ups and downs of the network where he has stuck it out and prospered.<ep>
   ``I never expected the waves would be quite as steep as they were,'' he admits. ``But even in the worst of times, it was better than anything I thought I'd ever have in life.<ep>
   ``And the rest of my life was so good. I could go home at the end of the day, and have my marriage and my wonderful family [three daughters, all grown]. It gave me equilibrium.''<ep>
<m1>Time for change<ep>
<m0>   And if NBC was critically off-balance at times, well, once or twice it may have worked in Brokaw's favor.<ep>
   ``I think that when I was on <m0>Today<m0>  and Fred Silverman came over here [as network president in 1978], one of his objectives was to get me off the show. But he had much larger problems. There was enormous chaos around here.''<ep>
   It was during that chaotic period, with prime-time ratings in a tailspin and the schedule in tatters, that Brokaw almost left NBC, almost leaped to ABC News, whose new boss, Roone Arledge, had come courting.<ep>
   ``I came very, <m0>very  <m0>close to going,'' Brokaw says. ``So close that I went out to dinner with Meredith and said, `I'm gonna do this,' and she went to bed thinking it was a good idea. Then I sat up and drank some scotch and smoked a cigar and stared out the window for several hours.''<ep>
   What he saw, of course, was his future at NBC.<ep>
   Brokaw says the rightness of staying has been validated for him over and over, such as when he landed a one-on-one interview with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the Kremlin, and when he led exclusive live coverage of the fall of the Berlin Wall.<ep>
<m1>With renewed spirit<ep>
<m0>   Brokaw's loyalty must have seemed particularly gratifying the past three years as he watched NBC News' incoming president, Andrew Lack, marshal a comeback for a news division that had seemed on the ropes.<ep>
   The renewed spirit has been further boosted by the four-month-old NBC News-Microsoft alliance and new frontiers it could lead to, beginning with the MSNBC cable channel that signs on this summer.<ep>
   Here, too, Brokaw will play an active role, sharing anchor duties with Katie Couric and Bill Moyers on a daily news-talk program with links to cyberspace.<ep>
