<m0>   LOS ANGELES (--) For a while, Ray Walston thought long and hard about heeding the command he so often uttered as Judge Henry Bone on TV's <m0>Picket Fences<m0> : ``Get out!''<ep>
   <m0>Picket Fences,<m0>  after all, is wrapping up its four-year run on CBS (--) its two-hour finale is set for tonight (--) and Bone is one of the pinnacles of Walston's <m4>Walston<m2><ql>
<m0>nearly 60 years in show business.<ep>
   ``Quite frankly . . . I thought, `Why try to beat this? You're not going to beat it. Take a walk,' '' Walston said last week in North Hollywood at an Academy of Television Arts & Sciences tribute to the much-honored series. ``Judge Bone had a lot of wonderful dramatic stuff to do, and that's something that I have not been able to get in a lot of films I've done and in a lot of TV shows.''<ep>
   But Walston (--) who's either 77, 78 or 81, depending on the source (--) ultimately decided to put off retirement. He has been plugging away for too many years, looking to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor, to give it up now.<ep>
   For the longest time, producers foolishly saw him only as a musical-comedy guy, so memorable was he in both the stage and screen versions of <m0>South Pacific<m0>  and <m0>Damn Yankees,<m0>  as the title character in the TV trifle <m0>My Favorite Martian<m0>  and as the irascible history teacher Mr. Hand in <m0>Fast Times at Ridgemont High.<m0> <ep>
   Billy Wilder's 1964 sex farce, <m0>Kiss Me Stupid,<m0>  in which Walston played a songwriter, should have been his big break. But the bluenoses at the Legion of Decency condemned the film as ``smutty.'' <m1><ep>
<m0>   A performance as Candy in Gary Sinise's 1992 remake of <m0>Of Mice and Men<m0>  earned him nice reviews, but no recognition <m1> <m0>. And then. . . <ep>
   ``I almost missed the boat on <m0>Picket Fences,<m0>'' Walston said. ``The agent called and said there was a small recurring role, and they would like for me to come in and read. I said, `Reeead?' ''<ep>
   Walston drew out the word, as only he can.<ep>
   ``I said, `Who are they?' And he told me who they were. It made no difference. But I wanted a job. So I went in to read.''<ep>
   Good thing, too. The role of Judge Bone has given him nearly everything he has sought in his career, including an Emmy from his peers last year. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``Judge Bone usually reflects the conscience of the town, and maybe the series,'' said David Kelley, the former lawyer who created the show. ``Usually, his rulings were as complex and as ambiguous as the issues themselves.''. <m2><ql>
<m1>   <m0>``As it has turned out, it has been one of the best parts I've had in a very long career,'' Walston said. ``So I think the whole idea of retirement is out of the question for now.''<ep>
   Case closed. Get out!<ql>
