r. T, meet Jim Profit.<P>

   Neither T's Mohawk haircut nor Profit's Brooks Brothers suits entirely define the fervid imagination of TV impresario Stephen J. Cannell, who fathered both characters.<P>

   Television's answer to Charles Dickens, he has created, produced or written more than his share of potboilers, from classics (Mission Impossible, The Rockford Files)  to lowbrow hits (The A-Team, 21 Jump Street)  to crowd-pleasers (The Commish, Hunter)  and cult phenomena (Wiseguy). To say nothing of such short-lived wonders as Missing Persons, Sonny Spoon  and The Hat Squad, or the cable-based adult crime series Silk Stalkings. <P>

   Cannell's latest -- a sharp contrast to his campy '70s hit The A-Team -- is Profit, which chronicles the misadventures of an executive at a Fortune 100 company. It was just launched as a midseason replacement on Fox, where its ratings haven't been as high as the buzz on it: It's about a guy who grew up inside a large cardboard box to become a scheming businessman and an executive's worst nightmare.<P>

    Meanwhile one of Cannell's most celebrated shows, Wiseguy  -- which also explored the darker corners of male bonding -- returns as a TV movie tonight.<P>

   En route to a meeting in Los Angeles, Cannell talked on his car phone about why he's bringing back Wiseguy  and how, with Profit,  he came to produce a TV show centered around a sociopath.<P>

   ``What happened in the case of Wiseguy, Ken Wahl came by my office one day and said `If you ever want to do Wiseguy  as a movie. . . .' CBS [which originally aired the series from 1987 to 1990] was lukewarm. The second place we went was ABC. [Entertainment president] Ted Harbert and others were big fans of the show when Wiseguy  was on the air. So we pitched it and they said, `Yeah, absolutely.' ''<P>

   Thus Vinnie Terranova returns to the TV screen, where tonight he infiltrates an unsavory high-tech company. In case you're wondering whether Cannell thinks Wiseguy's  savvy fans will buy his comeback when Terranova's character was supposedly killed off, Cannell says, ``He was never really dead. We left it where you could think that -- or think it was part of his cover.'' <P>

   Whatever you think, Cannell is hoping you watch. Behind the idea in reviving the show is Cannell's wish that Wiseguy  become a regularly appearing TV movie, along the lines of The Rockford Files.  Although tonight's project was written by Cannell lieutenant Joel Surnow, the producer says, ``I would love to write one.''<P>

   The critical problem is how to get Vinnie into the '90s. One of the show's charms was its uncanny ability to pinpoint a real-life social or political phenomenon almost minutes before it actually happened.<P>

    ``Off the top of my head,'' says Cannell, ``I haven't got [another storyline]. We would sit down and explore what would be an interesting place to go with Vinnie Terranova. I'm not saying we would want to do a militia plot, but certainly infiltrating a militia is something a federal agent might do.''<P>

   In the meantime, in addition to producing Profit,  Cannell has finished writing his second novel -- not a bad year for a guy who's dyslexic. (A cyberthriller called Final Victim, it will be published by William Morrow in July.) And he's got two more drama pilots in the pipes, ``one for UPN about aliens, and another drama for WB about a disabled police officer.''<P>

   Cannell admits to a fascination with weird human behavior, but says the main appeal of Profit  was a chance to ``turn the storytelling convention upside down, to put the bad guy in the center and be rooting against him instead of for him.<P>

   ``I'm fascinated by evil intent. Like a cobra in a basket, you're always waiting for him to strike.''<P>

   What's biting Cannell, however, are some recent mumblings about Profit  being anti-business. He appeared on CNBC just after the show premiered to discuss whether the show indulges in ``executive-bashing.'' His response: ``I don't think anyone thought it was a very legitimate complaint.<P>

   ``These guys make a million dollars a year,'' Cannell says, ``and they go and bawl about this. That's silly.''
