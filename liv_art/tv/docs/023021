<m0>essica Fletcher is hanging up her spy glass, but in the minds of her legions of fans, she's still on the case.<ep>
   Or on the ranch, the boat and the train, to name just a few places that South Florida viewers wish she'd show up. In answer to our survey about what the detective played by Angela Lansbury ought to do once <m0>Murder, She Wrote  <m0>closes its doors on May 19, we got a plethora of responses via TeleHerald, e-mail and fax. The message is that, even though CBS drove television's longest-running current prime-time show and one of its most popular characters to an early end, Jessica's fans aren't tired of her yet. About half of the responses were pleas to keep the show on the air. I'll reveal some other reader suggestions below.<ep>
<m1>Why is she going?<ep>
<m0>   But first, why is she leaving? <m0>Murder, She Wrote  <m0>fans got short shrift last fall when CBS, like other networks, decided to seek out a younger demographic. The network moved the show, popular with older viewers, from its longtime Sunday-night time slot to Thursday nights. During the season, CBS refused to accommodate star Lansbury, so the actress, justifiably sensing a brush-off, bailed. Although it was Lansbury's decision to make this her final season, the network mishandled one of its rare assets (--) and showed contempt for its viewers.<ep>
   The show's popularity is rooted in its colorful characters rather than its plots. Since Jessica's debut in 1984, the mild-mannered yet mentally sharp sixtysomething has represented a portrait of seniors that rarely gets shown on series television. Jessica is successful, independent and intelligent. (A retired schoolteacher, she was drawn into detective work during her healthy second career as a mystery novelist.) People respect her (--) even if she <m0>is<m0>  a magnet for foul play.<ep>
   In a TV environment that's more likely to show people older than 60 as marginal if not downright docile and silly, Jessica is much more than a role model. She's the epitome of dignity.<ep>
<m1>Where will she go?<ep>
<m0>   Now that she's leaving, where will she go?<ep>
   Readers had lots of ideas. Except for one suggestion that she die and become an organ donor (--) the better to give her young nephew a brain <m2><ql>

<m0>transplant (Alison Brooks, North Miami Beach) (--) and one vivid scenario that found Angela Lansbury hitting the skids after making a sequel to her 1962 film <m0>The Manchurian Candidate, <m0>almost every response indicated that Jessica has plenty of wholesome mileage left in her.<ep>
   It's to Lansbury's credit that her character is seen as someone capable of just about anything. One reader thinks Jessica ``should undertake managing a ranch in Reno, Nev., where women from the East go for divorces'' (Pauline Bunin of Hollywood). Another (R. Farber of North Miami Beach) suggested she open ``a Planet Cabot Cove restaurant crammed with crime-scene memorabilia.'' In the same vein, M.J. Vanderwerken of North Miami Beach suggests ``Jessica learns to drive. . . and gives crime-scene tours of Cabot Cove.''<ep>
   Most felt that Jessica's mental skills would hold her in good stead, although more than one reader thought she might like to trade in her sleuthing shoes for a seat behind a hotel desk. Graziella Cattarossi of Miami thought that hotel should be in South Beach; Kate Bastida of Miami thought it should be the one frequently shown on <m0>Matlock. <m0>(Bastida also suggested Jessica could become Matlock's girlfriend and partner in crime-solving, while Helen Camber of Hallandale thought Matlock and Jessica should go ahead and tie the knot.)<ep>
<m1>Broadway-bound?<ep>
<m0>   A versatile actress, Lansbury apparently convinces people that she could revive Jessica in made-for-TV movies or go her own way back to Broadway. For those who've forgotten, Lansbury made her film debut in <m0>Gaslight<m0> (1944) and went on to be a Broadway star. Her forays into TV have included the 1950s game show <m0>Pantomine Quiz<m0>, as well as anthology series <m0>Revlon Mirror Theatre<m0>, <m0>Stage 7<m0>  and <m0>Star Time Playhouse<m0>, all in the '50s. Her most recent film role was as the voice of the singing teapot in the 1991 Disney film <m0>Beauty and the Beast<m0>.<ep>
   Several readers though Lansbury could find work beyond the stage. Two ideas: run for president (Tom Verlain of South Florida) and host a news-talk show (Earl Morgan of Marathon). <ep>
   Still, it's Jessica (--) and not Lansbury (--) who actually embodies her viewers' hopes and dreams. Fans imagine her in new series playing ``a country doctor or a college professor'' (Mary Manzini of Hollywood), running a bed-and-breakfast in Maine (Bob Bolduc of Weston), or continuing her sleuthing activity on another mystery series (Virgilio H. Vilomar of Miami). Whatever Jessica decides, she should know she'd be welcome in a seniors' condominium complex in South Florida (Natalie Dodero of Fort Lauderdale); the Washington, D.C. area (Marie A. Bayne of Key Biscayne); and Portland, Maine or Boston (Sam and Margaret David of Hollywood). Her roles in these cities: a retiree, a Washington Post reporter, and the police commissioner, respectively.<ep>
<m1>X marks the spot<ep>
<m0>   The wackiest, and most spirited, suggestion we received for Jessica was from Lillian Pollard of Pembroke Pines, who, we think, must be an <m0>X-Files  <m0>fan, too. She thinks Jessica ought to ``own and operate a nursing home, where strange and unnatural things happen due to unearthly auras left by others.''<ep>
   But it's Don F. Clunk of Fort Lauderdale, joining the chorus of those enraged that <m0>Murder, She Wrote  <m0>is going off the air, who sums up the affection that Jessica's fans have.<ep>
   ``While I know it cannot run forever,'' Clunk writes, ``I like to think that when I tune in the TV, <m0>Murder, She Wrote  <m0>will be there somewhere.''<ql>
