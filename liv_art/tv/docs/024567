<ep>
<m0>   President Clinton spent about 90 minutes Saturday portraying himself in a TV movie scene that was taped in the Oval Office.<ep>
   <m0>A Child's Wish <m0>will air on CBS after the November presidential election.<ep>
   The movie tells the story of a family's hardships after a child is diagnosed with cancer. The father, played by John Ritter, loses his job when he <m4>Clinton<m2><ql>
<m0>spends time with his daughter (Anna Chlumsky) during surgery and rehabilitation.<ep>
   The president hopes his role will highlight the Family Medical Leave Act, one of the first laws he signed as president, said Ginny Terzano, deputy White House press secretary.<ep>
   In the brief scene, Clinton says a few lines as he welcomes the girl to the White House and fulfills her wish to meet the president. The scene is based on an incident in which Clinton returned from a morning jog and met such a family on a tour of the White House, which Terzano said ``was a very touching experience for him.''<ep>
   Executive producer Larry Horowitz said Clinton played the role like a natural.<ep>
   ``When you feel something, you're not acting, and that was the case here,'' said Horowitz.<ql>

<ep>
<m0>   <m0>Today <m0>show co-anchor Katie Couric had to cancel an appearance on <m0>The Late Show With David Letterman <m0>last week because NBC thought it would detract from <m0>The Tonight Show With Jay Leno's<m0> weeklong stint in Chicago.<ep>
   NBC apparently needn't have worried. Early figures show Jay probably posted his <m4>Couric<m2><ql>
<m0>best-ever average for a week on the road with his Windy City visit.<ep>
