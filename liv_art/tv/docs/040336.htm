DEEP IN HIS SUBCONSCIOUS: Author Peter Benchley.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> The Beast, 9 p.m. today and Monday, NBC, channels 6 and 5<BR>
<P>

   NBC wants you to think its sweeps-month miniseries is a sea monster of a horror film. I say it's sushi.<P>

   Based on Peter Benchley's bestseller, and among the most hyped TV movies of the year -- promotion began last February and continues full-tilt -- The Beast  is set in the Pacific Northwest in a town terrorized by a gigantic man-eating sea creature, described by one character as ``a torpedo with claws.'' For reasons that don't make sense, the story has been moved from the Atlantic Ocean's Bermuda Triangle, where, in the book, the eerie setting was reflected in the goings-on.<P>

    But The Beast's  true locale is deep in the subconscious of Benchley -- a place where humans get eaten alive by vengeful monsters. Unfortunately, that's a place whose dramatic possibilities have pretty much been exhausted -- at least by Peter Benchley. (The author is reportedly not happy with this production, but the book is hardly fodder for a masterpiece -- or even a good B movie.) And nothing the cast -- Karen Sillas, William Petersen, Larry Drake and Charles Martin Smith -- does can revive it.<P>

   In spirit and behavior, this beast so shamelessly mimics the white shark of Jaws  that the film echoes with dull familiarity. Virtually every frame has been lifted lamely from that 1975 theatrical film, from shots of the deep taken from the moving beast's point of view to footage of oblivious swimmers being yanked downward. Even the characters are moldy copies.<P>

   In its defense, The Beast  does contain a sparse handful of tasty B-movie moments. If the miniseries could be reduced to a five-minute version, I'd pick the scene in which the tentacled monster has its way with a two-man submersible vehicle -- after first scaring the daylights out of its passengers by pressing its giant eye to the porthole.<P>

   Aliens aside, the last time someone made a great movie about something with tentacles, it was Ed Wood, the B-movie idiot savant. His 1955 film Bride of the Monster  is a classic of low-budget mollusk filmmaking. Wood, unlike Benchley, was a storyteller who knew when to fish -- and when to cut bait.<BR>
