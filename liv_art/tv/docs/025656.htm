<BR>
<BR>
FRIDAY<BR>

   The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo In ``To Catch a Fish,'' Shelby (Irene Ng) and her pals (Adam Busch, Preslaysa Edwards) search for a dolphin that's missing from the Cocoa Beach marine lab, a case that's been shoved aside by the activities of a local smuggling ring.

   Nature ``The Call of the Kakadu'' travels to Kakadu National Park in northern Australia, a harsh wilderness that spends six months being pummeled by violent thunderstorms and monsoon rains, then six more enduring scorching drought and fires. The setting for the movie Crocodile Dundee,  the land of evergreen forests and lily-framed billabongs is home to a variety of exotic wildlife, including wallabies, cockatoos, giant saltwater crocodiles, dingoes, snakes and dragonlike lizards.

   The Prince and the Pauper In Disney's 1990, half-hour version of the Mark Twain classic, Mickey (voice by Wayne Allwine) takes the title roles as two look-alikes: a pampered prince who longs to explore the outside world; and a peasant who dreams of making ends meet.

Preschool; Grade-school. NIK at 1:30 p.m.<P>

    Biography Although Christopher Columbus gets all the credit, many historians believe that it was Norse explorer Leif Ericson who was the first European to set foot in the New World. According to legend, Ericson was on his way from Norway to Greenland around 1000 A.D. when a storm drove his ship west, where he landed in a place many now believe was Newfoundland or New England.
