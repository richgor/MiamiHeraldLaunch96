<m0>   The battle over how to rate children's television for violent content is now developing into the most controversial element of this year's federal V-chip legislation.<ep>
   In general terms, the broadcasting and production communities continue to dispute the notion that cartoons and fantasy shows, most notably the program known until recently as <m0>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,<m0> can represent a serious psychological danger to children.<ep>
   But advocates for more educational programming, many of whom gathered last week for a conference on children, TV and advertising at Stanford University, believe such programming needs clear warning labels for violent content.<ep>
   Few issues in recent years have been more politically charged, with TV under widespread attack for undermining family values with incessantly violent or sexually explicit programming.<ep>
   In response, the industry has complained bitterly that it's being made a scapegoat for broader social problems (--) and that its First Amendment rights are being threatened in the process.<ep>
   Rather than let the Federal Communications Commission create a ratings system, a networks-and-producers coalition is in the early stages of devising guidelines that could be used in conjunction with the so-called V-chip (--) circuitry that will be built into TV sets, allowing viewers to block reception of particular shows.<ep>
   The coalition's leader, Jack Valenti of the Motion Picture Association of America, says few decisions have been made. But at the same time, he says heavily criticized programming such as <m0>Roadrunner  <m0>cartoons can't, in his opinion, be categorized as violent.<ep>
<m0>Special rating for animation?<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   A source within the coalition, who asked not to be identified, said there has been discussion about putting most animation in a special ratings category, on the grounds that all but the youngest children can readily distinguish cartoons from live-action programs.<ep>
   That would provoke a noisy battle with organizations such as the Center for Media Education, whose husband-and-wife founders, Jeff Chester and Kathryn Montgomery, attended the conference at Stanford.<ep>
   ``Animation to young people is just as real as a documentary,'' said Chester.<ep>
   He said his organization would ask the FCC to reject any industry ratings proposal that downplays violence warnings for children's programming.<ep>
   FCC chairman Reed Hundt, who was the keynote speaker at the conference sponsored by the Children Now organization, declined to comment on the coalition's work.<ep>
   But Hundt said, in general, he considers the technology represented by the V-chip ``an unstoppable force'' that would lead to alternative ratings systems if the industry's proposal proves unpopular. Hundt said the V-chip mandated by the 1996 Telecommunications Act probably would be only one form of a program-blocking technology that manufacturers will offer consumers, and that a variety of educational and media organizations might collaborate on ratings systems.<ep>
   ``If Hollywood doesn't go with the flow,'' Hundt said, ``they'll be trying to sweep back the ocean with a broom.''<ep>
<m0>Help or hindrance?<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The conference focused on the role of advertisers in influencing and sponsoring programming. Opinions vary whether a ratings system will aid or stigmatize sponsors.<ep>
   Some entertainment executives believe a rating for violent content will give a show a more provocative image with kids and make it more popular than it might have been.<ep>
   But the most notable prime-time show that carries an advisory for adult content, ABC's <m0>NYPD Blue,<m0> has suffered from a lack of advertising interest. Chester thinks sponsors of children's programming would ``bear the wrath of the public'' for supporting any show rated violent.<ep>
   Valenti said his group has reached consensus on only a few general points. The most notable: All programming except news and sports would get some kind of rating (with the definition of ``news'' yet to be fully determined), and the system would differ clearly from the letter-rating system (G, PG-13, R, etc.) used for movies.<ep>
   When the coalition was formed, concern was raised that movie standards wouldn't translate meaningfully to TV. A different system may cause confusion among consumers, but Valenti dismisses that as a concern.<ep>
