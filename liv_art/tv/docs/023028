<m0>   NEW YORK (--) Load up your VCR tonight, hit ``record'' and let 'er rip. Some keepers are coming down the wire.<ep>
   We're talking the Beatles on <m0>Ed Sullivan.<m0>  The very first <m0>Gunsmoke<m0>  (from 1955). The teleplay that led to the <m0>Twilight Zone<m0>  series.<ep>
   You'll get the premiere episodes of two of television's finest (--) <m0>Hill Street Blues<m0>  and <m0>St. Elsewhere<m0>  (--) and a segment of one of TV's all-time, undisputed worst: <m0>My Mother, the Car.<m0>  And more.<ep>
   You're about to visit TV Land.<ep>
   Cable's Nick at Nite, which long ago dared to join the two words ``classic'' and ``television,'' is branching out with more of this stuff. A new companion channel, Nick at Nite's TV Land, will celebrate four decades of TV programming and the pop culture that went with it. Tonight, TV Land signs on.<ep>
   Whether it's included on your menu of basic services is in the hands of your local cable provider, and, sadly, you may not be among the lucky 4 million cable homes get<m2><ql>
<ql>
PLEASE SEE  TV LAND,  2C<qr>
<m4>--4.912 inches ( 29p7 )--from start of measuring to here--<m2><ql>
  <ql>
<ql>
TV LAND,  FROM  1C<ql>
<m0>ting TV Land from the get-go.<ep>
   But if not, despair not. For 9 1/2 hours, at least, TV Land will be available for sampling during the window normally occupied by Nick at Nite on the widely available Nickelodeon channel. That's from TV Land's official sign-on at 8 p.m., all the way through to 5:30 a.m. Tuesday.<ep>
   What's the difference between TV Land and Nick at Nite, the reruns-crazy service that since 1985 has pulled Nickelodeon's late shift?<ep>
   First of all, TV Land is around-the-clock classic TV. And while Nick at Nite is devoted exclusively to sitcoms, TV Land will harbor all genres, beginning with comedies, dramas, westerns and variety.<ep>
   ``TV Land is not just about a series or two,'' says Rich Cronin, president of the two networks. ``It's everything TV! Obsessed with TV! It's about the language of television. The music. The graphics. Test patterns. Even classic commercials.''<ep>
   Yes, that's right: Until October 1997, TV Land will air ``retromercials'' in place of national advertising. Look out for Speedy Alka-Seltzer, the fast-talking Federal Express guy, Life cereal's Mikey and hundreds more commercials of old.<ep>
   Here is the lineup for tonight:<ep>
   <m0>8 p.m.<m0> <m0>Love, American Style,<m0>  featuring a half-hour segment that served as the pilot episode for the sitcom <m0>Happy Days<m0>. <ep>
