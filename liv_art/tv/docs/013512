<m0>   Critical raves weren't enough to save Fox's new dark drama, <m0>Profit.<m0> <ep>
   The network has yanked the show for the remainder of the May sweeps (--) a quarterly ratings period used by local stations to set future advertising rates (--) and the series' four unaired episodes probably will have to wait for summer to be burned off for good.<ep>
   Fox also announced that starting June 3, a new drama, <m0>L.A. Firefighters,<m0>  would air in <m0>Profit<m0>'s 9 p.m. Monday berth. Until then, the network has scheduled a movie and a couple of specials to air in the time period through the sweeps.<ep>
   ``The show was not performing well in the ratings,'' said a Fox spokesman.<ep>
   That's an understatement. Last week, <m0>Profit,<m0>  which stars Adrian Pasdar as a ruthless businessman (--) a venal New Age J.R. Ewing, so to speak (--) was the lowest-rated program for the four major networks. The series has been in the Nielsen cellar since its debut April 8, despite all the praise it has received.<ep>
   <m0>L.A. Firefighters<m0>  is an ensemble drama starring Christine Elise (<m0>ER<m0> ).<ep>
   Also on June 3, Fox will debut <m0>The Last Frontier,<m0>  a sitcom about three single guys and their beautiful new roommate. It will air at 8:30 p.m.<ep>
   As a result, <m0>Melrose Place,<m0>  now airing from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Mondays, will come off temporarily. (<m0>MP<m0>'s a keeper.)<ql>
