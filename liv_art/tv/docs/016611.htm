   Hell hath no fury like a celluloid diva tossed out like last week's leftovers.<P>

   Michael Douglas learned it when he cut ties with Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction,  and, for that matter, with Demi Moore in Disclosure.  When Clint Eastwood tried to straddle the fence with a pair of Southern schoolmarms in The Beguiled,  he paid a heavy price.<P>

   And Sunday night Tim Matheson learns the lesson, too, courtesy of Jennie Garth in ABC's The Unfinished Affair. <P>

   Once scorned, Garth's crafty character plots a near-perfect revenge on the lover who leaves her, systematically breaking down his personal and professional lives.<P>

   ``I had a good time with it,'' she says of the telefilm. ``It's a good story with no hidden messages. It's a thriller, a suspenser. Pure entertainment.''<P>

   And, adds the veteran of Fox's long-running Beverly Hills, 90210:  ``It's always fun to play the bad girl. . . . It gets kind of boring to be nice, you know?''<P>

   Also, despite her character's continual Machiavellian maneuverings, Garth doesn't consider her to be evil.<P>

   ``She's not sociopathic at all, she's just. . .'' Garth pauses, ``. . . upset.''<P>

   Affair  has added appeal for the actress, as it's the third film she's helped produce under her Blue Puddle Productions. The added title of producer, Garth says, gives her a say in the hiring of writers, directors and actors, as well as the overall feel of the film.<P>

   At this point in her career, having played the same character so long on TV, Garth is in search of a wide variety of projects. ``I like strong women -- I like women who don't have to say a lot to get a point across. Women with a lot of heart and soul,'' she says.<P>

   Unfortunately, those scripts are few and far between.<P>

   As far as her future with Beverly Hills, 90210,  which begins shooting its seventh season in July, Garth has one more year on her contract. After that, she's not sure what's in store.<P>

   ``I don't know what's going to happen,'' she admits. ``There's a part of me that wants to move on. But it's a good job, and people love the show. I would miss it a great deal.''
