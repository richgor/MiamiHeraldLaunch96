   The finale of Murder One  scored big numbers for ABC, prompting hope that Steven Bochco's acclaimed freshman drama may be renewed.<P>

   The 22nd episode, which revealed the real killer of young Jessica, had a 13.0 national rating and 22 percent audience share in NYPD Blue's  10 p.m. Tuesday slot. (Each rating point equals 959,000 homes.)<P>

   That's 51 percent higher than Murder's  season-to-date average and the series' best showing since its second episode, on Sept. 26. Murder  won the time period, beating Dateline NBC  (11.0/19) and the second hour of The Hunt for Red October  on CBS, with a 9.1/16. ABC estimates that 18.2 million people caught the show, an increase of almost seven million from its season average. (Monday's two-hour segment, featuring the long-awaited verdict, attracted 15.9 million viewers.)<P>

   ``We're very encouraged by last night's performance,'' ABC Entertainment boss Ted Harbert said. ``Murder One  is definitely a candidate for renewal, but no final decision has been made.''<BR>
   Fans of ABC's Muppets Tonight!  have something to be happy about.<P>

   Even though the show currently isn't on the air, ABC has ordered 13 episodes for next season. ABC's Ted Harbert said the Jim Henson Productions program was an ``expertly produced'' show that ``should and will have every opportunity to grow into a successful network series.''<P>

   ABC recently yanked the show after a few telecasts because of low ratings. Harbert said the network is continuing to search for a time slot and date for a relaunch.<P>

   Cable's USA Network will launch two new series and has renewed a handful of other current offerings for the fall.<P>

   The channel has commissioned the production of Rudy,  a sitcom about an aspiring newscaster relegated to producing a children's puppet show, and La Femme Nikita,  a drama based on the film of the same name. USA has ordered 13 episodes of each.<P>

   USA also has renewed its animated cult-hit Duckman  and the hourlong drama Pacific Blue,  each for 22 episodes.<P>

   The new shows will debut during the 1996-97 season. They are the latest efforts under USA's entertainment president, Rod Perth, who, working with a company commitment of more than $140 million, has another 45 projects in development.<BR>
   BET's Ed Gordon may want to send a thank-you note to O.J. Simpson. Gordon's stock is sky-high since he interviewed Simpson Jan. 24 -- so high that the networks are courting Gordon for a correspondent's job, most likely in Washington.<P>

   ``We've talked to him,'' an ABC News spokeswoman confirmed. ``We respect his work. A lot of people in cable are interesting to us, but there's nothing in the offing at the moment.''<P>

   Said a CBS spokeswoman: ``I think Andrew [CBS News chief Andrew Heyward] has talked to a lot of people. I wouldn't be surprised if Ed Gordon is one of them.''<P>

   Officially, NBC says it hasn't spoken to Gordon, but Peacock insiders disputed this.<P>

   Gordon, 35, Black Entertainment Television's franchise player since 1988, drew critical raves for the Simpson interview. During the live, hourlong event, Gordon displayed dignity and restraint, never failing to address his subject as ``Mr. Simpson.''<P>

 <BR>
  Sunday will see the premiere of the first edition of the weekly Ivins-Crouch or Ivins-O'Rourke three-minute debates on CBS' 60 Minutes. <P>

   This Sunday's debate will start with a minute of commentary from social critic Stanley Crouch, followed by columnist Molly Ivins' minute, with 30-second responses from each in conclu<BR>
sion. Crouch, a contributing editor for the New Republic, and Rolling Stone satirist P.J. O'Rourke will take turns every other week fencing with Ivins, the liberal Fort Worth Star-Telegram columnist.<P>

   A spokesman couldn't say what this week's topic will be or when in the broadcast the debate will air, but suggested it won't be at the end, next to Andy Rooney's commentary.<BR>
