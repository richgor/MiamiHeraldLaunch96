   The battle over how to rate children's television for violent content is now developing into the most controversial element of this year's federal V-chip legislation.<P>

   In general terms, the broadcasting and production communities continue to dispute the notion that cartoons and fantasy shows, most notably the program known until recently as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, can represent a serious psychological danger to children.<P>

   But advocates for more educational programming, many of whom gathered last week for a conference on children, TV and advertising at Stanford University, believe such programming needs clear warning labels for violent content.<P>

   Few issues in recent years have been more politically charged, with TV under widespread attack for undermining family values with incessantly violent or sexually explicit programming.<P>

   In response, the industry has complained bitterly that it's being made a scapegoat for broader social problems -- and that its First Amendment rights are being threatened in the process.<P>

   Rather than let the Federal Communications Commission create a ratings system, a networks-and-producers coalition is in the early stages of devising guidelines that could be used in conjunction with the so-called V-chip -- circuitry that will be built into TV sets, allowing viewers to block reception of particular shows.<P>

   The coalition's leader, Jack Valenti of the Motion Picture Association of America, says few decisions have been made. But at the same time, he says heavily criticized programming such as Roadrunner  cartoons can't, in his opinion, be categorized as violent.<P>

Special rating for animation?<P>

<P>

   A source within the coalition, who asked not to be identified, said there has been discussion about putting most animation in a special ratings category, on the grounds that all but the youngest children can readily distinguish cartoons from live-action programs.<P>

   That would provoke a noisy battle with organizations such as the Center for Media Education, whose husband-and-wife founders, Jeff Chester and Kathryn Montgomery, attended the conference at Stanford.<P>

   ``Animation to young people is just as real as a documentary,'' said Chester.<P>

   He said his organization would ask the FCC to reject any industry ratings proposal that downplays violence warnings for children's programming.<P>

   FCC chairman Reed Hundt, who was the keynote speaker at the conference sponsored by the Children Now organization, declined to comment on the coalition's work.<P>

   But Hundt said, in general, he considers the technology represented by the V-chip ``an unstoppable force'' that would lead to alternative ratings systems if the industry's proposal proves unpopular. Hundt said the V-chip mandated by the 1996 Telecommunications Act probably would be only one form of a program-blocking technology that manufacturers will offer consumers, and that a variety of educational and media organizations might collaborate on ratings systems.<P>

   ``If Hollywood doesn't go with the flow,'' Hundt said, ``they'll be trying to sweep back the ocean with a broom.''<P>

Help or hindrance?<P>

<P>

   The conference focused on the role of advertisers in influencing and sponsoring programming. Opinions vary whether a ratings system will aid or stigmatize sponsors.<P>

   Some entertainment executives believe a rating for violent content will give a show a more provocative image with kids and make it more popular than it might have been.<P>

   But the most notable prime-time show that carries an advisory for adult content, ABC's NYPD Blue, has suffered from a lack of advertising interest. Chester thinks sponsors of children's programming would ``bear the wrath of the public'' for supporting any show rated violent.<P>

   Valenti said his group has reached consensus on only a few general points. The most notable: All programming except news and sports would get some kind of rating (with the definition of ``news'' yet to be fully determined), and the system would differ clearly from the letter-rating system (G, PG-13, R, etc.) used for movies.<P>

   When the coalition was formed, concern was raised that movie standards wouldn't translate meaningfully to TV. A different system may cause confusion among consumers, but Valenti dismisses that as a concern.
