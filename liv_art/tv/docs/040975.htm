<LI> Barbara Walters: 20 Years at ABC, 9:30 tonight, channels 10 and 25<BR>
<styl>   Having already redefined the term ``chutzpah'' during her career as an American institution, newswoman-turned-provocateur Barbara Walters adds a few more syllables to the word tonight.<P>

   Barbara Walters: 20 Years at ABC  is no ordinary vanity project. Retracing the career of the journalist/celebrity vulture -- or at least the part of it that occurred at ABC -- the 90-minute program, which she hosts, touches down on such Walters milestones as her 1977 joint interview with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat; her problematic relationship with cg-anchor Harry Reasoner; and, yes, the ``infamous tree question.''<P>

   Indeed, Walters replays her much-ridiculed interview with Katharine Hepburn in slow motion to demonstrate that it was Hepburn who <BR>
brought up the subject of trees before Walters asked Hepburn to identify herself as a leafy entity.<P>

   Low points aside, the special presents Walters as a fully formed newswoman who, with future 20/20  partner Hugh Downs, hosted The Today Show  for NBC in the '60s and '70s before being lured to ABC to become the first woman network anchor in 1976. Walters also talks about the controversy over her groundbreaking $1 million anchor salary (she says she made as much as Reasoner -- half a million -- for delivering the news, plus another half-million for four prime-time specials).<P>

   It's the specials, of course, that helped make celebrity TV journalism the glitzy sideshow it is today. In fact, Walters points out that her early ``serious'' interviews -- with the Shah of Iran or Fidel Castro, for example -- lost in the ratings to Barnaby Jones.  Compelling clips of those and other interviews are included: A visibly drunk Betty Ford takes her on a White House tour. Tom Hanks, in 1989, says he doesn't expect to ever win another Oscar.<P>

   Ironically, 20 Years  proffers few details of Walters' life, the sort the TV-watching public has counted on Walters to pull out of politicians and movie stars.<P>

   Instead, with glib running commentary, Walters assumes the role of her own best critic. As such, she doesn't exactly apologize for her weakness for getting into the act. But recalling how she once told President-elect Jimmy Carter to ``be wise, be good to us,'' she admits that colleague Morley Safer then referred to her as ``the first female pope.''<P>

   Critic-proof and impervious to satire (Gilda Radner's celebrated ``Baba Wawa'' parody is never mentioned), Walters should last another 20 years, with the help of advertisements like this.
