<BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
  <P>

   All My Children: In Jamaica, a devastated Mateo, Taylor and Jack held a memorial service for Noah and Julia. Corinne later told Mateo that Julia and Noah were not really dead, but that she had to administer an antidote to the death potion before they really die. When Corinne and Mateo went to give Noah and Julia the antidote, they panicked when Julia's coffin was missing. Mateo is still trying to get Taylor to confess her evil deeds. Liza forked over some bribery money when Jonathan threatened to reveal that she killed his wife. <P>

   Another World: Rachel, Felicia and Sharlene helped Paulina give birth at the Cory cabin. Joe arrived at the cabin just as his son, Dante Mackenzie, was born. Nick was suspicious when Jake was smug about losing the building that houses Joe's restaurant to Joe in a card game. Joe, who asked Jake not to tell Paulina how he won the building, became upset when he learned that he owes back taxes on the building. Nick realized Donna still loves Matt, who made love with Blair. Josie showed Gary evidence proving that Blair chloroformed him and got him drunk. Josie was later shot during a confrontation with Blair. <P>

   As the World Turns: Via a big screen TV, John accused Lisa of ruining him professionally, said he hates her and would never marry her. Lisa kept a stiff upper lip through the ordeal, and later left for Hong Kong to find a manufacturer for Carly's clothing designs. A knife-wielding mystery person terrorized Samantha in her apartment. After the incident with the mystery person, Samantha convinced Kirk to rehire Diego and continue her therapy. Police commissioner Bill Mason read the riot act to Tom, Margo and Hal after Clegg was found dead in his jail cell. Tom, Margo and Hal believe Clegg's ``suicide'' was murder. <P>

   The Bold and the Beautiful: Stephanie told Taylor that her blood tests showed nothing wrong, but Stephanie still does not feel well, and is worried that she is getting forgetful. Everyone was curious when Grant brought Taylor to the Forrester's welcome to the company party for Grant. Sheila tried to seduce Grant after learning he works for Forrester. <P>

   The City: Richard was upset that Zoey showed a photo of her mother on his TV show, Hotline.  After Nick admitted once living with Cassie, Zoey's mother, Zoey shocked everyone, including Nick, by announcing he is her father. Jocelyn told Ally that she slept with Malcolm to keep him from revealing her hooker past. Tony and Alex are investigating the call girl ring on their own. <P>

   Days Of Our Lives: A stunned Kristen found the love letter John wrote Marlena when he thought he was going to be executed. John came close to finding the letter, which Kristen hid in a book in the DaMera library. Kristen believes that if she gets pregnant, she will not lose John to Marlena. Marlena and John tried to avoid their feelings for each other. Jack was thrilled and Jennifer crushed when the Woman in White said she knows for certain that she saw Peter and Jude arguing. Laura gave the Woman in White an injection that caused her to remember losing her husband and children. Under the drug, the Woman in White again saw Peter and Jude together. <P>

   General Hospital: The Quartermaine clan and Lois' mother tried to help Ned and Lois solve their problems and get back together. Meanwhile, Amy blabbed to Ned that Lois is pregnant before Lois could tell him herself. Despite their expected baby, Lois and Ned are still estranged. Worried that Luke may have killed Damian, Lucky lied to Garcia that he did the deed with a lamp. Garcia questioned Luke and later arrested him after Lucky said Luke had purchased a baseball bat for the kids at Ward House, and Damian was killed with a baseball bat. Monica heard Jason tell Lila that she is the only family member who accepts him the way he is. <P>

   Guiding Light: At the reading of Henry's will, everyone was stunned to learn Hart received the bulk of the estate. J was miffed that Henry only left him money for college, while he left Nola money. Dinah nixed taking money from Hart so she could drop her revenge plot against Roger. During a sonogram test, a stunned Blake learned that she is having twins. Ross was thrilled by the news of the twins, but Blake secretly wondered if one child could be fathered by Ross and one by Rick. A mystery person took an interest in a newspaper article about the Spaulding clan. <P>

   One Life To Live: Cassie fumed when Kevin printed a story about Carlo using information that she got but didn't not use in her story on Carlo. Kevin antagonized Carlo despite Viki and Clint's warning that Carlo is dangerous. Kevin and Antonio fought when Kevin tried to give Andy a birthday gift. A ski-masked man stabbed Kevin in the back while he waited for Patrick, with whom he planned to search Carlo's hotel room. Andy panicked when she found Antonio's knife at the site of Kevin's stabbing. Bo was angry when he caught Patrick in Carlo's hotel room. Patrick found yacht company business cards in Carlo's suite. <P>

   The Young and the Restless: Vicky slapped Brad and accused him of wanting to marry Nikki to gain power and money. When Victor asked if Nikki wishes they had a future together, she insisted she loves Brad. When Nikki quizzed Brad about Chris and Victor's relationship, he revealed that Chris works part-time for Newman Enterprises. Chris was upset after Danny urged her not to wait forever for Paul, and Mary insisted that Paul misses her. Nikki arrived just as Victor was embracing Chris, who finally removed Paul's engagement ring because she believes they will never reconcile. Phyllis fumed when Dr. Reid wondered why she slept with him, but continues to insist that she loves Danny.<P>
