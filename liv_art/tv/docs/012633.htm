   What becomes a legend most? Sometimes, it's commercial failure.<P>

<P>

   Tonight and Tuesday, Steven Bochco (Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law) wraps up the first -- and, most probably, only -- season of Murder One, his experimental courtroom drama that left port last fall only to encounter almost every creative sandbar imaginable. (Don't worry, tonight you will  hear the verdict.)<P>

   According to Bochco, however, despite Murder One's  low ratings and mixed reviews, the experiment was ``very much'' a success.<P>

   ``I've done shows that haven't been successes,'' says the creator of 1990's best-forgotten police musical Cop Rock. ``You know, shows that haven't really done it in a way that's been completely satisfying. With this one, I felt we told a really good story. We wrote it really well, produced it well. All the creative elements are right.''<P>

   Then why wasn't anyone watching? <P>

   The show's continuing-story format was an obstacle to many viewers, but the real weakness was that, among all the characters -- from Neal Avedon, the movie-star murder suspect, to the sinister Richard Cross (brilliantly played by Stanley Tucci), to defense attorney Ted Hoffman -- there was no one to root for, no one whose fate was remotely compelling.<P>

   At its best, Murder One  was as well-written and well-acted as anything on TV. At its worst, which was often, it was boring.<P>

   Indeed, for many who watched the show from its September debut when it aired Thursdays opposite ratings blockbuster ER,  then waited out its December hiatus and caught up with it again in January, when it got a Monday night berth, viewing Murder One  became more of a chore than a pleasure. <P>

   It didn't help that the second episode arrived the same week as the O.J. verdict.<P>

   Murder One  not only had the bad manners to show up just as most of America was sick of defense lawyers, but it also proffered -- in Daniel Benzali's deft portrayal of attorney Ted Hoffman -- one of the coldest protagonists to ever hit the TV screen. Benzali is a formidable actor, but tuning in to him week after week was prodigiously unsatisfying.<P>

   To make matters worse, Bochco saddled this character with a ill-conceived private life. (After a decade of marriage, his wife suddenly wakes up and realizes that Hoffman's career is destructive to family life?) Halfway through the show's run, Bochco took Hoffman's wife, the show's most vibrant moral compass, out of the dramatic foreground.<P>

   Is it any surprise Murder One  probably won't grace the fall schedule?<P>

   Bochco, who's already working on two shows for next season (a mid-season drama about private eyes for ABC and a sitcom called Public Morals  for CBS) and whose NYPD Blue  is finishing up a strong third season, says he won't find out Murder One's  fate until next month.<P>

   But he does have ideas about what he <BR>
<BR>

PLEASE SEE  MURDER ONE,  2C<BR>
<BR>

  <BR>
<BR>

would do if the show returns.<P>

   ``If it does come back, there are some adjustments I would make, but I wouldn't alter the fundamental concept. Primarily, I would tell two stories instead of one. Just as the first one would be winding down, I'd put the second one on its feet. That would give the audience the sense that if they miss a few episodes, the whole season isn't a bust. It'd be psychologically a less daunting notion.''<P>

   Bochco says the best part of the Murder One  experience was ``the opportunity to write something that's very much like a novel and not starting over every week with a different enterprise. It required a certain amount of patience from viewers -- maybe more than most viewers were willing to give it -- but once having laid all that cable, the thing I thought would happen did. Patience did pay dividends.'' <P>

   Despites its flaws, it's impossible to dismiss Murder One  outright. All good artists fail -- it's part of the creative process. And failures frequently represent the working out of creative problems that makes the next success possible. Unfortunately our TV culture, with its 10-minute memory, doesn't indulge many missteps. Only a proven entity like Bochco gets a chance to fall on his face and come back again. <P>

   ``There really was a learning curve. I've been writing TV shows for 25 plus years,'' says the guy who cut his teeth on the early '70s series The Bold Ones. ``Over all those many years and hundreds of episodes, you learn a certain way to write these things, and you have to unlearn that.<P>

   ``I find myself having to learn to not be impatient in terms of revealing too much too soon. I think this is a unique form. I'd love to do it again.''<BR>
<BR>

    Fans of Murder One  have another opportunity to examine the evidence, survey the suspects and vote for the character they think committed the crime. And if you're a newcomer to the series, you can get a crash course in all the whos and whats before airtime for the finale.
