   President Clinton spent about 90 minutes Saturday portraying himself in a TV movie scene that was taped in the Oval Office.<P>

   A Child's Wish will air on CBS after the November presidential election.<P>

   The movie tells the story of a family's hardships after a child is diagnosed with cancer. The father, played by John Ritter, loses his job when he <BR>
spends time with his daughter (Anna Chlumsky) during surgery and rehabilitation.<P>

   The president hopes his role will highlight the Family Medical Leave Act, one of the first laws he signed as president, said Ginny Terzano, deputy White House press secretary.<P>

   In the brief scene, Clinton says a few lines as he welcomes the girl to the White House and fulfills her wish to meet the president. The scene is based on an incident in which Clinton returned from a morning jog and met such a family on a tour of the White House, which Terzano said ``was a very touching experience for him.''<P>

   Executive producer Larry Horowitz said Clinton played the role like a natural.<P>

   ``When you feel something, you're not acting, and that was the case here,'' said Horowitz.<BR>
Couric spot put on hold<BR>
   Today show co-anchor Katie Couric had to cancel an appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman last week because NBC thought it would detract from The Tonight Show With Jay Leno's weeklong stint in Chicago.<P>

   NBC apparently needn't have worried. Early figures show Jay probably posted his <BR>
best-ever average for a week on the road with his Windy City visit.<P>

   Dave's taking his show to San Francisco this week with guests including:<P>

   <LI> Actor Keanu Reeves and his band Dogstar, making the band's TV debut tonight. Also appearing: Dr. Quinn star Jane Seymour and Mad About You star Paul Reiser.<P>

   <LI> Dean (Superman) Cain and Elvis Costello on Wednesday.<P>

   <LI> Eddie Murphy and Green Day on Thursday.<P>

   <LI> Alice in Chains and Nash Bridges star Don Johnson on Friday.<BR>
Latest renewals<P>

<P>

   CBS has ordered ``at least'' 22 episodes of Chicago Hope and 25 episodes of The Nanny for next season, raising to seven the number of series renewed by the network so far for 1996-97 -- including Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman; Touched by an Angel; Walker, Texas Ranger; Cybill and Murphy Brown.<BR>
Generational comedy<P>

   <P>

   NBC has picked up David Kelley's first sitcom, starring Ray Walston, 82, and Fyvush Finkel, 73, late of Kelley's just-concluded Picket Fences on CBS. Walston and Finkel play roommates/brothers-in-law who take in their twentysomething niece as a boarder.<BR>
Four's company?<BR>
<P>

   On June 3, Fox will launch The Last Frontier, a sitcom about three single guys in Alaska and their beautiful new -- female -- roommate. Frontier is set for 8:30 p.m., following repeats of Thomas Hayden Church's Ned and Stacey.<BR>
Melrose picked up<BR>
<P>

   After its May 20 season finale, Melrose Place definitely will return in the fall and may air in repeats over the summer, Fox says.<BR>
Zahn, Smith out as anchors<BR>
<P>

   CBS This Morning co-anchor Paula Zahn has confirmed that, once the morning show is reformatted in August, she's moving on to other things.<P>

   On Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, Zahn said that she and CBS News president Andrew Heyward have discussed her options. After seven years with This Morning, Zahn will be reassigned within the network.<P>

   CBS News president Andrew Heyward said an announcement will be made soon on the future assignments for Zahn and her co-anchor, Harry Smith, who said earlier he'll move on to other duties at the network when the show changes format.<P>

   Sources at CBS say that Zahn will most likely become a contributor to the network's newsmagazine 48 Hours and the Dan Rather-anchored evening news.
