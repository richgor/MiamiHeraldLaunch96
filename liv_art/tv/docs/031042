<m0>   <m0>Barney & Friends <m1>  <m0>In ``Any Way You Slice It,'' the school celebrates its annual International Festival, and the playground is decorated with flags from around the world, and display booths.

A sudden snack attack leads them to the idea of bread, and Stella tells a story that inspires the gang to feature breads of the world in their booth (--) and to create one of their own. <m0>Preschool; Grade-school. <m0>PBS, Ch. 2 at 7:30 a.m.<ep>

Jonathan Brandis (<m0>seaQuest DSV<m0> ) plays city kid Rand, who reluctantly moves to Africa with his widower dad (Chris Noth).

<m0>   <m0>Movie ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids''<m0> This delightful 1989 family comedy stars Rick Moranis as absent-minded inventor Wayne Szallinski, who invents a machine that shrinks things. Unfortunately, it accidentally reduces his kids and two neighbor boys (Robert Olivieri, Amy O'Neill, Thomas Brown, Jared Rushton) to a quarter-inch tall. They wind up in the backyard and must rely on their courage and wits to survive such gargantuan horrors as an ant, a bumblebee (kids prone to bug nightmares may want to skip this) and a lawnmower. <m0>Grade-school; Family. <m0>TBS at 10:35 a.m.<ep>
   <m0>Circus! 200 Years of Circus in America<m0> A two-hour documentary traces the history of the American circus from its beginnings in 1793 as an equestrian extravaganza.

<m0>TUESDAY<ql>
<m1><ue5> <ep>
<m0>   <m0>Movie ``Kidnapped''<m0> The 1960 version of the Robert Louis Stevenson novel is faithful to the original, set in 18th Century Scotland, with a good cast and vivid atmosphere. James MacArthur stars as young David Balfour, the heir to an estate, whose greedy uncle has him shanghaied and taken aboard a strange vessel. Balfour escapes and joins a rebellion led by Alan Breck Stewart (Peter Finch). <m0>Grade-school; Family. <m0>DIS at 7 p.m.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>The Composers Specials: Bizet's Dream<m0> The story of young Michelle (Brittany Madgett), who feels neglected when her piano teacher, composer Georges Bizet (Maurice Godin), seems more interested in writing his opera <m0>Carmen<m0>  than in their lessons.

   <m0>Movie ``Forbidden Planet''<m0> It may be slow going for younger kids, but this ambitious, intelligent 1956 science-fiction classic is a treat for parents and older youngsters. Loosely based on Shakespeare's <m0>The Tempest,<m0>  it follows a band of stalwart explorers in the year 2200, led by a very serious Leslie Nielsen, to Altair-4, where an expatriate scientist (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter (Anne Francis) have created a technological paradise with the help of obedient Robby the Robot. <m0>Grade-school; Family. <m0>TNT at 4 p.m.<ql>
