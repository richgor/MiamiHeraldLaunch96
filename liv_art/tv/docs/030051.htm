   The sky is falling -- it's splattering on a screen near you.<P>

   If you've watched the Weather Channel or The Wizard of Oz, you know about the dramatic possibilities of tornadoes, blizzards and hailstones the size of sweet potatoes. (You may even know that an average of 93 people are killed by lightning in the United States each year.)<P>

    But have you noticed how eager Hollywood is to exploit our newfound fascination with the weather?<P>

   Savage Skies, an earnest and somewhat dry four-part weather documentary, begins tonight on PBS. (It's narrated by meteorologist Al Roker and features South Florida weather guru Bryan Norcross). Tuesday, Fox checks in with a TV movie called Tornado! Sunday, Night of the Twisters  plays on the Family Channel. And Twister, the first would-be blockbuster of the summer -- a movie about storm chasers -- opens Friday.<P>

   Coincidence? Hardly.<P>

   After the unrelenting snows of this past winter, the Midwestern flooding and, yes, the record number of tropical storms that marched toward South Florida in 1995, it's not surprising that funnel cloud and storm surge are challenging Tom Hanks at the box office.<P>

    Weather is scary all by itself. But it took the entertainment industry to exploit all its horrific possibilities and bring the weather into our living rooms. Now, Mother Nature is the star in a new kind of disaster movie.<P>

   Of course, rubbernecking while other people battle adversity is one of the oldest forms of entertainment. If '70s disaster movies -- Airport, The Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno -- made Mother Nature a supporting player, this new crop of movies and weather specials puts her in the center of the marquee. After all, film geniuses like Kurosawa and John Ford have always exploited the cinematic effect of storm clouds, but they didn't have '90s-era CGI (computer generated images) to create realistic special effects.<P>

   It's no coincidence these films are showing up in the wake of recent documentaries by the Weather Channel and National Geographic that grabbed unprecedented ratings. And since its inception, the Weather Channel has slowly expanded the definition of weather to include volcanoes and fires -- natural phenomena that draw viewers.<P>

   What's a B-movie vampire or a triceratops compared to something that really might lift your home from its bearings and send it spinning? After all, nothing <BR>
Savage Skies, people pay money to be put in the path of a twister. Go figure.) And, so far, the demand for these video weather products exceeds the supply -- several of the documentaries contain the same Hurricane Andrew footage.<P>

   With the way these films are proliferating, we can probably count on being entertained by real and fictional Midwesterners and Floridians battling the elements for years to come. <P>

   For the producers, the best thing about this new genre is it's everywhere -- and it's free. As one expert in Savage Skies puts it, weather ``comes right out of thin air.'' And there's new material arriving almost every day.
