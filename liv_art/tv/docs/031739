<m0>   Asked to name a popular cable network, most viewers would tick off CNN, ESPN, Nickelodeon.<ep>
   Those networks offer very specific types of programming (--) news, sports and children's shows, respectively.<ep>
   Indeed, conventional wisdom says a cable network succeeds when viewers and advertisers can readily define its genre and know that it interests them.<ep>
   Yet, the most popular cable network in prime time for the past six years has been the USA Network, whose programming defies definition, running the gamut from lowbrow crime movies to reruns of <m0>Murder, She Wrote  <m0>and <m0>Wings,<m0> from upper-crust golf and tennis to the vaudeville of pro wrestling. The variety makes USA's schedule more closely resemble old-fashioned broadcast television than cable.<ep>
   Now, USA, which bowed in 1977 as a sports network, is trying to capitalize on that resemblance and change its muddled image by trying to crack one of the last barriers separating broadcast TV's entertainment programming from basic cable's: the original series.<ep>
   ``We think we virtually are the fifth network now, behind NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox,'' says Kay Koplovitz, chairman and chief executive officer of USA Networks, which includes the Sci-Fi Channel. ``And the confluence of trends is in our favor. Now is the time for a big move.''<ep>
   Koplovitz has steered USA through joint ownership by combinations of five different corporate titans over the years.<ep>
   The latest corporate move involves the network's present owners, MCA and Viacom, which sued each other over a clause in their partnership agreement. Both companies would like to gain sole ownership of USA, in part because they see the same trends Koplovitz does.<ep>
   These include the growth in cable's availability and its share of the viewing audience. In prime time this season, viewers who get both cable and broadcast channels have spent about 30 percent of their time watching cable shows, a number that's shot upward the past few years.<ep>
   ``If I'm going to get a slice of the pie, I might as well go after a slice of the bigger pie,'' says Koplovitz, making it clear that USA wants to attract viewers from the broadcast networks by developing shows more like those of broadcast TV.<ep>
   She has invested $140 million in original programming this year, a hefty amount for a cable network. She also hired Rod Perth from CBS 18 months ago as president of USA Network Entertainment. While the network is based in New York, Perth remains in Los Angeles, where he's trying to persuade the better-caliber producers and writers to develop shows for USA.<ep>
   For next season, USA has four new series in production. Two are based on popular movies: <m0>The Big Easy,<m0> a detective drama with a networklike budget of about $1 million an episode, and <m0>La Femme Nikita,<m0> an action drama based on the 1991 French film. The two others are comedies.<ql>
