<m0>   When <m0>Masterpiece Theatre  <m0>flees the drawing rooms of England and travels to Los Angeles, you can almost hear the heavens rumble.<ep>
  And when the series departs from its Royal Shakespeare Company-only casting and puts the spotlight on an American actor, it must mean the world as we know it is coming to an end.<ep>
   <m0>Signs and Wonders,  <m0>a two-parter starting tonight, starring James Earl Jones, is hardly typical <m0>Masterpiece Theatre  <m0>fare. Set in the present, it's the story of a British woman (Prunella Scales from <m0>Fawlty Towers) <m0>who hires a man named Diamond (Jones) to deprogram Claire, her daughter caught up in a religious cult in California.<ep>
   The story unfolds amid the neon lights, biker bars and streetwalker haunts of L.A., where the twentysomething Claire (Jodhi May) has fled. The daughter of an English vicar, she's been recruited by the World Mercy Mission, headed by Father Mercy. She's content to live in the cult's mansion-sized commune and spend her nights on Hollywood Boulevard collecting money for Father's movement.<ep>
   Claire's mom Elizabeth hires Jones to kidnap her from the fortresslike commune and bring her home.<ep>
   What follows is the closest thing to an action-adventure that <m0>Masterpiece Theatre  <m0>fans will ever get (--) car chases, FBI searches, the resurfacing of a one-time Nazi ideologue. It's also an unsettling look at why people are vulnerable to specious belief systems and charismatic leaders.<ep>
   While Elizabeth closes in on Claire, the rest of the family is suffering its own crises of faith back home. The vicar (David Warner) doesn't understand why his parishioners have taken up with a show-biz-driven evangelical preacher. And Claire's brother Stephen (Michael Maloney), a religion professor, is learning facts about his own academic guru (Donald Pleasance) that make him doubt his life's work.<ep>
   <m0>Signs and Wonders  <m0>(--) the title refers to a Gospel quote about what people need in order to believe (--) doesn't make Claire's cult experience the only illegitimate one. It questions <m0>everyone's <m0>motives.<ep>
   It's a thrill to see Jones (--) the American who most resembles a Royal Shakespeare Company actor (--) more than hold his own. May gives a strong performance as a fragile wraith. The most compelling presence is that of Warner as the vicar, who undergoes his own brutal deprogramming.<ep>
   But give the biggest round of applause to <m0>Masterpiece Theatre  <m0>for turning its back on safe costume dramas in favor of a story with jagged edges.<ql>
