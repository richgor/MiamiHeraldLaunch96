 FAMILY TV PROGRAMMING <BR>
 <BR>
<P>

   Here's a week's worth of the best TV programming for children and families. Each capsule includes a recommendation on appropriate audiences -- pre-school, grade-school or the whole family.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

 <BR>
<BR>

FRIDAY<BR>
   Barney & Friends In ``Any Way You Slice It,'' the school celebrates its annual International Festival, and the playground is decorated with flags from around the world, and display booths. Unfortunately, the kids haven't come up with a design for their booth. A sudden snack attack leads them to the idea of bread, and Stella tells a story that inspires the gang to feature breads of the world in their booth -- and to create one of their own. Preschool; Grade-school. PBS, Ch. 2 at 7:30 a.m.<P>

   Reading Rainbow Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters,  written by John Steptoe and narrated by Phylicia Rashad, is an African folk tale about two very different sisters. LeVar Burton celebrates African culture in New York City's Central Park, where he learns how to play authentic instruments and kicks up his heels with an African dance troupe called Forces of Nature. Preschool; Grade-school. PBS, Ch. 2 at 11:30 a.m.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

 <BR>
<BR>

SATURDAY<BR>
   Movie ``Born Free: A New Adventure'' Shot entirely on location in Africa, the new family film follows the attempt to return Elsa, a human-raised lion cub, to the wild. Jonathan Brandis (seaQuest DSV ) plays city kid Rand, who reluctantly moves to Africa with his widower dad (Chris Noth). Ariana Richards (Jurassic Park ) plays Val, who, together with her mother (Linda Purl), has raised Elsa for a year. Now the local game warden (John Matshkiza) gives them three weeks to get Elsa ready for the bush -- or it's off to a zoo. Grade-school; Family. ABC, channels 10 and 25 at 8 p.m.<P>

   Space Cases In ``Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Court,'' Harlan's (Walter Jones) recklessness has put the ship in danger once too often, and the kids hold their own court-martial. But while they're distracted by the legal wrangling, the ship slips into a parallel dimension, and the crew is in danger of turning into Spung. Grade-school. NIK at 9 p.m.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

 <BR>
<BR>

SUNDAY<BR>
   Movie ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' This delightful 1989 family comedy stars Rick Moranis as absent-minded inventor Wayne Szallinski, who invents a machine that shrinks things. Unfortunately, it accidentally reduces his kids and two neighbor boys (Robert Olivieri, Amy O'Neill, Thomas Brown, Jared Rushton) to a quarter-inch tall. They wind up in the backyard and must rely on their courage and wits to survive such gargantuan horrors as an ant, a bumblebee (kids prone to bug nightmares may want to skip this) and a lawnmower. Grade-school; Family. TBS at 10:35 a.m.<P>

   Circus! 200 Years of Circus in America A two-hour documentary traces the history of the American circus from its beginnings in 1793 as an equestrian extravaganza. Included are rare ``backlot'' scenes with clown Emmett Kelly and other circus legends; and new performances from the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus, the Big Apple Circus and the Cirque du Soleil. Grade-school; Family. A&E at 8 p.m.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

 <BR>
<BR>

MONDAY<BR>
   LiftOff! The magazine-style educational show uses aerospace subjects to excite and engage students in entry-level math and science concepts, reminding them that man couldn't have gotten to the moon without math. Grade-school. A&E at 7 a.m.<P>

   We All Have Tales Sigourney Weaver narrates The Peachboy,  a Japanese folktale about a small boy who is discovered inside a peach and adopted by loving parents. He grows up to be a mighty warrior who saves his village from rampaging ogres. Preschool; Grade-school. SHO at 7 a.m.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

 <BR>
<BR>

TUESDAY<BR>
   Movie ``Kidnapped'' The 1960 version of the Robert Louis Stevenson novel is faithful to the original, set in 18th Century Scotland, with a good cast and vivid atmosphere. James MacArthur stars as young David Balfour, the heir to an estate, whose greedy uncle has him shanghaied and taken aboard a strange vessel. Balfour escapes and joins a rebellion led by Alan Breck Stewart (Peter Finch). Grade-school; Family. DIS at 7 p.m.<P>

   Walt Disney World Inside Out The episode is dedicated to Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade, in its farewell season after a 24-year run. Hosts Brianne Leary and J.D. Roth take a turn as float drivers, and talk to the technicians and performers who make the parade happen. Meanwhile, Tonight Show  host Jay Leno ``steals'' the parade's signature float, a Mine Train loaded with precious gems. He ``magically'' makes the 50-mile trek to Burbank and distributes the gems to his audience. Preschool; Grade-school; Family. DIS at 8:30 p.m.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

 <BR>
<BR>

WEDNESDAY<BR>
   The Composers Specials: Bizet's Dream The story of young Michelle (Brittany Madgett), who feels neglected when her piano teacher, composer Georges Bizet (Maurice Godin), seems more interested in writing his opera Carmen  than in their lessons. Michelle begins to equate the story of Carmen  with her own father, who is fighting in Spain. Grade-school; Family. HBO at noon<P>

   Movie ``Forbidden Planet'' It may be slow going for younger kids, but this ambitious, intelligent 1956 science-fiction classic is a treat for parents and older youngsters. Loosely based on Shakespeare's The Tempest,  it follows a band of stalwart explorers in the year 2200, led by a very serious Leslie Nielsen, to Altair-4, where an expatriate scientist (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter (Anne Francis) have created a technological paradise with the help of obedient Robby the Robot. Grade-school; Family. TNT at 4 p.m.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

 <BR>
<BR>

THURSDAY<BR>
   Movie ``In Search of the Castaways'' Hayley Mills stars in the 1962 adaptation of the Jules Verne classic, as a teenage girl who embarks with her younger brother on an expedition to find their father, a long-lost sea captain. Along the way, they battle fire, flood, earthquake and other disasters. With Maurice Chevalier and Wilfrid Hyde-White. Grade-school; Family. DIS at 7 p.m.<BR>
