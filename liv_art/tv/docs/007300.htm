<LI> Picket Fences (series finale), 9-11 tonight, CBS, channels 4 and 12<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
 BY PHIL ROSENTHAL<BR>
 Los Angeles Daily News<BR>
<BR>
   LOS ANGELES -- For a while, Ray Walston thought long and hard about heeding the command he so often uttered as Judge Henry Bone on TV's Picket Fences : ``Get out!''<P>

   Picket Fences,  after all, is wrapping up its four-year run on CBS -- its two-hour finale is set for tonight -- and Bone is one of the pinnacles of Walston's <BR>
nearly 60 years in show business.<P>

   ``Quite frankly . . . I thought, `Why try to beat this? You're not going to beat it. Take a walk,' '' Walston said last week in North Hollywood at an Academy of Television Arts & Sciences tribute to the much-honored series. ``Judge Bone had a lot of wonderful dramatic stuff to do, and that's something that I have not been able to get in a lot of films I've done and in a lot of TV shows.''<P>

   But Walston -- who's either 77, 78 or 81, depending on the source -- ultimately decided to put off retirement. He has been plugging away for too many years, looking to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor, to give it up now.<P>

   For the longest time, producers foolishly saw him only as a musical-comedy guy, so memorable was he in both the stage and screen versions of South Pacific  and Damn Yankees,  as the title character in the TV trifle My Favorite Martian  and as the irascible history teacher Mr. Hand in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. <P>

   Billy Wilder's 1964 sex farce, Kiss Me Stupid,  in which Walston played a songwriter, should have been his big break. But the bluenoses at the Legion of Decency condemned the film as ``smutty.'' <P>

   A performance as Candy in Gary Sinise's 1992 remake of Of Mice and Men  earned him nice reviews, but no recognition . And then. . . <P>

   ``I almost missed the boat on Picket Fences,'' Walston said. ``The agent called and said there was a small recurring role, and they would like for me to come in and read. I said, `Reeead?' ''<P>

   Walston drew out the word, as only he can.<P>

   ``I said, `Who are they?' And he told me who they were. It made no difference. But I wanted a job. So I went in to read.''<P>

   Good thing, too. The role of Judge Bone has given him nearly everything he has sought in his career, including an Emmy from his peers last year. <P>

   ``Judge Bone usually reflects the cofscience of the town, and maybe the series,'' said David Kelley, the former lawyer who created the show. ``Usually, his rulings were as complex and as ambiguous as the issues themselves.''. <BR>
``As it has turned out, it has been one of the best parts I've had in a very long career,'' Walston said. ``So I think the whole idea of retirement is out of the question for now.''<P>

   Case closed. Get out!<BR>
<BR>
