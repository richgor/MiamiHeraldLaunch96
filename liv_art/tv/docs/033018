<m0>   Attention, fans of Camelot.<ep>
   Just days after the last auctioneer's gavel fell in the Jackie O estate auction, you are about to get a chance to eyeball an entirely different lot of Kennedy goods on television.<ep>
   Dominick Dunne's best-seller <m0>Season in Purgatory,  <m0>a CBS miniseries airing Sunday and Tuesday, is an unabashed study of the Kennedy family pathology.<ep>
   It's officially about the fictional Bradley family, a wealthy political brood caught in a murder and its cover-up, but Dunne draws such close parallels with the real-life Kennedy dynasty that even the Hyannis Port scullery maids will be able to recognize themselves. The family itself is a cross-hatched composite of three generations of Kennedys (--) saintly matriarch, dysfunctional children, womanizing menfolk and all.<ep>
   At its center is Gerald Bradley, a Joe Kennedy-like patriarch played by Brian Dennehy, himself a dead ringer for Ted Kennedy. Gerald is married to Grace. With a name like that, she's meant to be the Rose character, but (--) in an oddly funny twist (--) she's played by Blair Brown, the actress born to wear a pillbox hat. Like Rose and Joe's and Jack and Jackie's, theirs is a marriage of double standards. She's an avid Mass-goer; he goes after his daughters' friends.<ep>
    Their children, too, are a fictional mishmash of JFK's siblings and his nieces and nephews (--) handsome, athletic youngsters whose mishaps <m2><ql>

<m0>and felonies alike are swept under the rug by Daddy's influence. (As daughter Kitt, Sherilyn Fenn of <m0>Twin Peaks <m0> fame chews scenery as the family lush.)<ep>
   Set at the Bradleys' beach house, Manhattan apartments and sprawling Connecticut mansion, the miniseries is a voyeur's dream, a video skeleton-key that's lets us into the corridors of money and elitism that until now we've only been able to read about. And what a strange Irish universe it is: There's no one in it without a brogue or a freckle. In one scene, Grace casually rechristens a maid (--) changing her name from Debbie to Colleen (--) as though it were the charitable thing to do.<ep>
   Idiosyncrasies aside, the central story's about a murder committed by Constant, the favorite son and presidential fodder, and the way the family covers it up by manipulating Constant's shanty-Irish schoolmate Harry (Patrick Dempsey), a scholarship boy who is befriended by the Bradleys because of his book smarts. <m1> <m0>The crime, a date-rape gone to extremes, contains elements of the two most famous Kennedy legal brouhahas, Chappaquiddick and the more recent William Kennedy Smith rape trial.<ep>
   It's been years since the gleam of Camelot started to tarnish, but it's still wildly refreshing to have the Kennedy excesses, however thinly disguised, laid out for our inspection. Through Gerald and his sons, we see a dynasty supposedly built on pro-family blarney that's actually fueled by the ability to buy or intimidate anyone. As one character puts it, ``The Bradleys aren't just a family. They're a religion, a cult.'' <ep>
   <m0>Season of Purgatory  <m0>doesn't so much point the finger as yank the cloth off the altar on which we've placed the Kennedys. <ep>
   That's why the best parts of the miniseries aren't the scenes about Gerald's iron-fisted powermongering or Harrison's soul-searching about exposing the crime (--) or even the devilish cliffhanger that concludes part one. Instead, it's the scenes of incidents we always suspected happened behind closed doors.<ep>
   Like when Bonnie Bedelia (who gives the series' best performance), cast as the gritty lawyer defending Constant, shocks the Kennedy women by using a sexual term that wouldn't turn the head of a fifth-grader. Or when, minutes after Gerald suffers a stroke, Grace goes to her room to try on funeral veils, only to be told her husband's going to live. <ep>
   What to make of all this? When networks trot out miniseries that delve into leadership qualities, it can only mean the presidential election is a few months off. Watch <m0>Season of Purgatory  <m0>and remember, we get the idols we deserve.<ql>
