usic can evoke moods and gleaming pictures in sound. Tone poems by Liszt, Strauss, Tchaikovsky and others have proved that. But because music consists of tones rather than words, it's impossible to know the true meaning of a musical work, unless the composer chooses to reveal it. Once that's known, even the most familiar piece sometimes assumes a sharply different character.<P>

  Take the music of Dimitri Shostakovich.<P>

  The composer's popular Festive Overture, for example, is a rousing curtain-raiser often heard at pops concerts. It is relentlessly jubilant, fast and furious, almost hysterical at times. Its mood of celebration conjures images of dancers whirling about desperately with fixed, forced smiles.<P>

  But this loud and brash score takes on a whole new meaning when you learn from the composer's memoirs that the exultation you hear is Shostakovich's delirious joy at the death of Stalin. Just learning that makes the Festive Overture seem suddenly savagely sardonic, and you can never hear it again in quite the same way -- certainly not as a holiday pops piece.<P>

  The Symphony No. 11, subtitled The Year 1905, is anotherwork by Shostakovich that wears two faces. This hourlong epic, which Michael Tilson Thomas and the New World Symphony will revive Friday and Saturday in the Lincoln Theatre, was commissioned by the Soviets for the 40th anniversary of the Russian Revolution. Nevertheless, it memorializes victims of the 1905 uprising that preceded the seismic upheaval of 1917. Or so you might think from its subtitle.<P>

  The darkly brooding music does, in fact, describe the icy palace square and the 1905 ``Bloody Sunday'' massacre of civilians by the czar's troops. But the Eleventh also harbors a secret agenda, as the composer disclosed in his posthumously published recollections. It is his commemoration of the heroes of the 1956 Hungarian uprising. <P>

Shostakovich, who was often a target of the Soviet press, lived in fear most of his creative life and dared not make any public statement about the brutal suppression of Hungary's freedom fighters. But this 1957 score, he assured posterity, ``deals with contemporary events, even though it's called 1905.'' History repeats itself, ``and I <BR>
wanted to show this recurrence in the Eleventh Symphony. It's about the people, who have stopped believing because the cup of evil has run over.''<P>

  Awareness of this makes the music, in retrospect, seem even more universal -- especially the second movement, which is so graphic in depicting the execution of defenseless people.<P>

  The hidden messages in music, however, don't necessarily have to be social or political. They may simply be deeply psychological and highly personal, as with Gustav Mahler. In each of his nine sprawling symphonies, rustic Austrian folk dances and village band tunes jostle for attention and commingle with sublimely radiant, often tragic, song.<P>

   Mahler himself wondered why his frequent clashing of banal march tunes with serene, gorgeous melodies was so basic to his musical style, and in 1910 he ferreted out the reason with the help of none other than Sigmund Freud. Freud, who met Mahler for a one-day analysis in Holland, had recently completed an essay on the influence of childhood experiences on the creative psyche (Leonardo da Vinci and a Memory of Childhood), and he was fascinated by the composer.<P>

  It seems that as a child, Mahler suffered from his father's brutal treatment of his mother. He witnessed many ugly scenes between his parents, and after one of their most violent quarrels, he ran out of the house smack into an organ-grinder cranking out the German ditty O du lieber Augustin. The dissonance of such trite music with a tragic event in his early life haunted Mahler whenever he composed, he told Freud -- in fact, he often felt these intrusions of commonplace music might ultimately prevent him from creating art of the highest order.<P>

  Being aware of what Freud concluded was Mahler's ``obsessional neurosis'' certainly can help a concertgoer hear Mahler's music with a fresh understanding and perspective. The stark juxtaposition of different music may no longer seem so strange, or at best quaint and incidental.<P>

  Extra-musical insights such as these also can enhance works that on first hearing seem unimportant or ineffectual.<P>

  For example, Liszt wrote reams of brilliant, ardently romantic piano music, but at least a few pieces are less highly regarded and rarely performed. Among these, Il Penseroso (The Thinker) was inspired on a trip to Italy by Liszt viewing the famed Michelangelo statue that contemplates the tomb of Giuliano d&eacute; Medici in Florence.<P>

  On its own, Liszt's little piano piece may seem static, dull, an ineffective dirge. But listening to it while gazing at a photograph of the Michelangelo statue that so captivated the composer somehow heightens the pensive, stately quality of the music, which does seem to re-create the emotions Michelangelo's sculpture must have evoked in the composer.<P>

  Such ``sight and sound'' listening experiences can apply to other artworks, including Rachmaninoff's The Isle of the Dead, an orchestral tone poem inspired by one of several versions of a macabre painting by the German Romantic artist Arnold BoEcklin. The meaning of Rachmaninoff's musical masterwork becomes clearer looking at the painting while listening. The music is not just an aural parallel of the painting, but an evocation of its mood.<P>

  You hear in Rachmaninoff's music BoEcklin's deathly imagery. You sense the rocky isle backed by tall cypresses, the small boat with its coffin and its priestly white figure moving slowly toward shore. The orchestral colors are as dark as the painting (though what Rachmaninoff saw was only a black and white reproduction). An undulating 5/8 rhythm evokes the rowing of the skiff through the waves. It's haunting music, tellingly linked to a specific vision.<P>

  Of course, it can be risky to hear things in someone's music the composer may not have really intended to put there at all -- or perhaps as a mere afterthought. <P>

   In the summer of 1980 I interviewed then 87-year-old Elsa Respighi, widow of the composer of the dazzling orchestral showpiece The Pines of Rome. We met in her Rome apartment where, surrounded by precious art objects from the couple's pre-World War II villa, she explained how Respighi (who died in 1936) composed The Pines back in 1924.<P>

<BR>
<P>

   Don't be fooled by the various titles of its movements, especially The Pines Near a Catacomb, The Pines of the Janiculum and The Pines of the Appian Way. Though some program annotators suggest Respighi's musical inspiration was directly linked to his visions of such scenes, Mrs. Respighi adamantly insisted her husband merely added those piney descriptions long after conceiving and writing most of the music. Only the first movement may actually have been inspired by a scene. And Elsa Respighi should know. She contributed to that movement by suggesting and singing for Respighi the children's songs heard at the start of the piece in The Pines of the Villa Borghese.<BR>
   <P>

  If enough time is spent exploring the background of a particular score, it's surprising what pertinent information can be gleaned and which even the most perceptive musician or listener, no matter how intuitive, could never find in the musical notes alone. But fortunately, some composers love to tell you everything -- and Hector Berlioz was one of them.<P>

  The clues Berlioz left to the meaning of his 1829 masterpiece Symphonie Fantastique are so rich and valuable that conductors ignore them at their peril. Berlioz wrote an extensive program that reads like a novel. In it, a man hopelessly in love (which Berlioz was in real life) runs from country fields to an uproarious ball, experiences an opium-induced dream during which he believes he has murdered his beloved, then is condemned to death and witnesses his own execution. You can't miss it in the movement titled The March to the Scaffold.<P>

  But Berlioz not only spelled the whole thing out, he left additional information on the germination of the symphony in his memoirs, detailing how he doted on the writings of Jean Pierre Claris de Florian (1755-94) and how he related the opening theme of his symphony to a stanza from Florian's romance Est&eacute;lle et Nemorin.<P>

  What would Mendelssohn, who composed eight volumes of so-called Songs Without Words, have thought of all this? Well, Mendelssohn once said he believed that the emotions music evokes are ``not too vague for words, but too specific.'' Perhaps. But knowing what a musical work is all about doesn't destroy its mystery, it just deepens its impact.<P>
