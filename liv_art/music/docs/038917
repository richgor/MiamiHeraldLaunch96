<m0>   Every year since 1989, insiders and hopefuls from the Latin music industry in the United States have gotten together at the Billboard Latin Music Conference in Miami. For the veterans, it's an annual ritual of handshaking and backslapping done with open ears and a wary eye. Between hype and hard numbers, blank poker-player stares and well-practiced casual grace, now and then there are even some deals made.<ep>
  For the rest, outside looking in, it's a chance to network, to learn about this week's hot trend, to land that Hollywood-style break, or to console another hopeful.<ep>
  For anyone interested in Latin music in the United States, the event, coming up Monday through Wednesday, is an annual invitation to get a sense of where Latin music has been and might be going. It can be a rewarding exercise, especially given recent trends.<ep>
<m1>An old story<ep>
<m0>   The economic, social and political effects of a growing Latino population (over the next two decades, Latinos are expected to become the largest minority group in the United States) <m1> <m0>are only now beginning to be felt. But certain issues (--) the fault lines of diversity, the contradictory impulses to fully assimilate and retain roots, the limits of integration (--) have been playing out in the sound and the business of Latin music for some time.<ep>
  In the past five years, says John Lannert, who has been Caribbean and Latin America bureau chief for Billboard since 1991, ``the whole Latin music industry has gone from the mom-and-pop store type, cottage industry to a pretty thriving business.''<ep>
  It is still, however, ``highly regionalized,'' he continues. ``You'll have blips of certain artists happening all over the place, in pockets of, say, salsa in Los Angeles. But, for example, Regional Mexican will never happen in Miami.''<ep>
    Hard numbers are difficult to come by, and though estimates have ranged from 35 to more than 200 percent growth in total sales in recent years, Lannert says Latin music accounts for only 2 to 3 percent of the total music sold.<ep>
<m1>No accurate count<ep>
<m0>    The numbers are deceiving, Lannert suggests, pointing at piracy and sales not accounted for. ``Things are improving,'' he says. ``We will never have an accurate count because a lot of music is sold through nontraditional channels like swap meets.''<ep>
  Still, the growth is real and the result of ``a combination of factors.''<ep>
  ``Most obvious is the numbers of the Latino population and the fact that labels have gotten much better at reaching a lot of Latinos.'' <ep>
   In fact, the coming of age of American Latinos might have great impact not just on the business side but also on the artistic side, and that would be good news.<ep>
    Artistically, last year was a disappointment. Lannert calls it ``a flat year, no one broke new acts.''<ep>
    Even for the casual observer, this should not be a surprise. By and large Latin pop has been stuck in time for decades (how many more years of the romantic balladeer can we take?), salsa has been a wasteland for more than a decade now, Regional Mexican has new names pursuing old formulas and <m0>rock en espan~ol<m0>, while promising, needs serious nurturing.<ep>
  Just out of enlightened self interest, if not artistic sensibility, those who watch the bottom line should seize the opportunity.<ep>
<m1>Reason for optimism<ep>
<m0>   Lannert watches developments with guarded optimism.<ep>
  Production values in Latin music might eventually improve, he says, ``but so far, it applies only to pop (--) and once you go past a Gloria [Estefan], a Julio [Iglesias] or a Lui(acu)s Miguel, <m1> <m0>it is not up to par yet. I don't know why this audience is more forgiving when it comes to salsa and merengue.''<ep>
  Artistically, ``if you have a lot of buyers, the labels will have to put out something appealing to them. These are not people who are going to buy Madonna <m0>and <m1> <m0>Dyango. It just won't happen. <m0>Rock en espan~ol <m0>is a concert attraction right now, but from the chart standpoint I still have to see it get any significant play over long periods of time. But I see the labels coming around because they have to.'' <ep>
  It is an intriguing moment.<ep>
  The pop music industry praises originality but rewards conformity. It has always looked for its next platinum-selling record in last week's hit and it always had to be kicked and pushed forward, whining all the way to the bank.<ep>
  For the Latin music industry it turns out that demographics cut both ways. Old ways may soon be no way. Who knows? Keep an ear open. Latin music history might yet repeat itself, but at least it might be worth listening to. <ql>
