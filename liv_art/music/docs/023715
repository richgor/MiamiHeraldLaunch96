<m0>   Miami Beach country songwriter <m0>Donn Hecht<m0> has 185,000 reasons to love <m0>Garth Brooks<m0>, but he can't bring himself to do it.<ep>
   Hecht co-wrote the country standard, <m0>Walkin' After Midnight, <m0>in 1956. You might remember <m0>Patsy Cline<m0>'s rendition, her first country/pop crossover smash (--) the centerpiece of her <m0>Greatest Hits  <m0>CD, which has spent a record 219 weeks (and counting) at No. 1 on Billboard's Country Albums Catalog chart. Brooks recorded a tepid cover of <m0>Midnight  <m0>on his 1982 CD, <m0>The Chase<m0>,<m0> <m0>and Hecht (--) who has lived in Miami Beach for 23 years (--) is aghast at what Brooks did to the tune.<ep>
   ``Garth Brooks does what he does very well indeed, but one thing he cannot do is give justice to a traditional country song,'' Hecht said shortly after the country star's Miami Arena concerts last month. (No, Hecht did not go.) Hecht says Brooks' version is too ``pop'' for his taste, a malady infecting most of the current country market, and besides, Brooks' pipes belt out ``marginal talent at best.''<ep>
   Hecht continues: ``I may be suspect of hypocrisy considering the fat royalty checks received as a result of Garth Brooks' recording of one of my standards . . . My mixed emotions are tantamount to the whore who gratefully accepts the money but despises the act from whence it came.''<ep>
   <m0>Whew<m0>.<ep>
   So how much has Brooks' trilling added to Hecht's bank account? ``The IRS is very happy,'' he says, laughing. ``I'm always in hock with them; I would say [I've earned] close to $185,000 thus far.''<ep>
   And that's just off Brooks' cover. The classic song has sold more than 20 million copies since Hecht presented it to a reluctant Cline in the late '50s.<ep>
   ``Patsy didn't want to record it,'' he recalls. ``She was very hard to get along with, a wonderful person, but very tough to get along with when it came to discussing material.''<ep>
   Cline died in a plane crash in 1963, and Hecht still thinks about her, especially when he notes the dearth of current comparable talents. ``I was one day away from doing an entire album with Patsy before she was killed, and it shook me up. I've always felt someday I'm going to hear another artist that has some of what Patsy had, that undefinable quality.''<ep>
   Hecht, who still produces country songs for the European market, thinks newcomer <m0>Mandy Barnett<m0> (``There's a girl I should send material to'') and <m0>Trisha Yearwood<m0> (``A unique style'') represent the closest match.<ep>
<m1>Disappointments<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Davie singer/songwriter <m0>Mary Karlzen<m0>'s tenure with Atlantic Records appears to be history. The label released her <m0>Yelling At Mary  <m0>debut in January 1995, but the CD has sold only 10,000 copies, according to SoundScan. This, despite positive reviews and a tour. Atlantic balked at Karlzen's decision to self-produce a follow-up (--) the label intended for <m0>Hootie & the Blowfish <m0>guitarist <m0>Mark Bryan<m0> to serve as producer, and the two recorded demos earlier this year. No Bryan, no CD, says Atlantic.<ep>
   ``Mark is a terrific guy,'' Karlzen said before her unbilled performance Saturday night at Rose's Bar on South Beach. ``But he wanted to turn me into an adult contemporary artist, and I couldn't live with the demos. It was a hard decision.''<ep>
   Message to Mary: Artistic integrity is commendable, but if you're not heard, who cares? For example, <m0>Joan Osborne<m0> reportedly is not satisfied with the production on her breakthrough CD, <m0>Relish, <m0>and its pop hit <m0>One of Us<m0>.<m0> <m0>She has said it doesn't showcase her voice and what she's capable of. What Osborne gained by compromising, though, was a double-platinum CD and the clout to demand her sequel be more representative of her talents. Exposure is what Karlzen needed at this stage, and the Hootie connection (--) however bland the group might be (--) was a gift.<ep>
   Meanwhile, another local group, <m0>For Squirrels<m0>, is also struggling. No doubt, the death of two members last September in a van crash was insurmountable, but the group's 550 Music/Sony debut, <m0>Example<m0>,<m0> <m0>and its single, <m0>Mighty K.C.<m0>,<m0> <m0>still managed to chart, thanks to radio and MTV play. But a decision to send the survivors on the road before they were ready (--) a show earlier this year at Rose's was cathartic, but some reviews elsewhere were negative (--) has stifled the band's momentum. Sony would've better served its act by continuing to work the band at radio and the media rather than allowing them to tour. Nevertheless, For Squirrels gives it a go at The Edge, 200 W. Broward Blvd., Fort Lauderdale, at 8 p.m. Thursday with headlining alternative band, <m0>The Nixons<m0>. Tickets are $10. Call (954) 525-9333.<ep>
