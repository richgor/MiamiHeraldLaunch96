Herald Staff Writer<P>

   SunFest '96, a major art and music festival, promises to draw almost 300,000 people to Flagler along the Intracoastal Waterway throughout its five days. Where else can you see a fireworks display before July 4th, munch on mega-foodstuffs and keep the kids busy with hands-on activities, puppet and magic shows and art displays.<P>

   But if God were One of Us  he'd a) be tired of that song, or b) check out its singer, headlining act, Joan Osborne. Here's a look at her and some SunFest featured performers this week:<P>

JOAN OSBORNE<P>

<LI> 9:15 p.m. Thursday on the NationsBank Stage<P>

   This has been quite the year for newcomer Osborne. She was recently up for five Grammy awards pegged to her major label debut album, Relish,  and that  song about a God with human qualities. OK, she left the ceremonies empty-handed, but hey, the exposure helped Relish  reach two million in sales and landed her sexy Right Hand Man  video on MTV. Osborne, a New Yorker with a bluesy voice, says she's a bit disappointed with Relish  -- too produced and polished. She's said her follow-up will really showcase her vocal abilities, and as a live act she's known to be quite hot.<BR>
THE BAND<P>

  <LI> 8:30 p.m. Wednesday on the NationsBank Stage.<P>

  The veteran (mostly) Canadian rockers may be Robbie Robertson-less these days, but that hasn't stopped them from optimistically titling their latest CD High on the Hog.  If you liked rootsy '60s Band-fare such as Up on Cripple Creek  or The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down  (we still say Joan Baez owns that song, sorry guys) you should like the new CD, even if it does feature yet another  reworking of Bob Dylan's Forever Young,  a tune rapidly approaching Feelings  in appeal.<BR>
MARY KARLZEN<P>

 <LI> 6 p.m. Thursday on the Fidelity Federal Stage.<P>

   ``Who can turn the world on with a smile . . . '' Oops, wrong song, but appropriate. If you've seen Mary, you like Mary. There's just something about this singer/songwriter and her confessional pop/rock songs that endears. Atlantic Records released her major label debut, Yelling at Mary,  last year and didn't do enough to make sure everyone heard it. Let's hope her forthcoming summer release gets more attention.<BR>
LISA LOEB & NINE STORIES<P>

  <LI> 8 p.m. Thursday on the Fidelity Federal Stage.<P>

   Actually there's one story here: a song by the name of Stay,  which was featured in the 1994 flop flick Reality Bites.  The quiet pop song became a No. 1 single before the bespectacled Loeb even had a label deal. Its success launched a bidding war and Geffen snapped her up and released the full-length CD, Tails,  last year to moderate acceptance.<P>

  <LI> SunFest Concerts: John Mayall, 7:30 p.m. Wednesday; The Band, 8:30 p.m. Wednesday; Joan Osborne, 9:15 p.m. Thursday; Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories, 8 p.m. Thursday; Mary Karlzen, 6 p.m. Thursday; Edwin McCain, 7 p.m. Thursday; Flagler Drive in downtown West Palm Beach, from Banyan Boulevard to Lakeview Avenue; $8 one day, $20 five-day pass; (407) 659-5992.<P>
