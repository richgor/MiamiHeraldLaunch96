<m0>   The Florida Philharmonic is extending its season, originally scheduled to end this month, into June for a three-day Brahms Festival.<ep>
   ``We have enough orchestral services to put on a small festival within our budget,'' says Philharmonic music director James Judd, ``so we'll try to raise money with this festival.''<ep>
  June 3, a host of soloists will perform Brahms chamber music at Miami's Gusman Center. June 5 and 7, Judd will conduct the Philharmonic and chorus plus vocal soloists to be announced in performances of Brahms' <m0>German Requiem<m0>  at Broward's Bailey Hall, then Gusman Center.<ep>
 Most of the soloists will donate their services, and the performers in the chamber series are lustrous: The duo-piano team Lisitsa and Kuznetsoff will play Brahms' <m0>Variations on a theme of Haydn<m0>  in the two-piano version, and pianist Joseph Kalichstein, violinist Elissa Lee Kokkonen and principal horn Andrew Lewinter perform the E-flat Major Horn Trio, six piano pieces, Op. 118, and cellist William De Rosa will tackle the E minor Cello Sonata.<ep>
 So why Brahms? ``Next year is the 100th anniversary of his death, and though we're doing a little of his music next season, I thought since we have the festival within budget now, why not anticipate his anniversary and do something special?'' Judd said.<ep>
    Tickets are priced from $15, and students may purchase two tickets at $5 each on the evening of performances after 7 p.m. by presenting a valid full-time student I.D. Call 930-1812, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays, in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach.<ql>
