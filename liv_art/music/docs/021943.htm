STEVE MILLER BAND<BR>
<LI> 8 tonight-Saturday at Sunrise.<P>

<P>

  The hits of this '70s pop act speak for themselves: Jet Airliner.  The Joker.  Swingtown.  Jungle Love.  Abracadabra  (a song whose lyrics Miller said he came up with while thinking about Diana Ross). Purists prefer the group's blues songs of the '60s, but hey, you might hear some of those too.<P>

  <LI> Steve Miller Band: 8 tonight-Saturday; Sunrise Musical Theatre, 5555 NW 95th Ave., Sunrise; $32.75, $23.75; (954) 741-7300.<BR>
THE NIXONS/<BR>
FOR SQUIRRELS<BR>
<LI> 8 p.m. Thursday at The Edge.<BR>
<P>

  The Rocking Oklamoma City-based Nixons have been at it for six years, touring incessantly. The band's latest CD, Foma, is climbing the charts as a result.<P>

   Gainesville's For Squirrels evolved from the tuneful pop of its independent, Baypath Rd, CD to a more aggressive sound on its major-label entry, Example.  It's been a rough year for the band, time for rebuilding, re-evaluating.<P>

HOWARD COHEN<BR>
<BR>
<P>

  <LI> The Nixons and For Squirrels: 8 p.m. Thursday; The Edge, 200 W. Broward Blvd., Fort Lauderdale; $10; (954) 525-9333.<BR>
LYNYRD SKYNYRD/<BR>
THE DOOBIE BROTHERS<BR>
<LI> 8 p.m. Thursday at Coral Sky.<P>

<P>

  There will be more guitars than you can throw a pick at during this double-bill concert featuring '70s rock acts, Lynyrd Skynyrd (That Smell,  Free Bird)  and this incarnation of the Doobie Brothers (the early China Grove -rock Doobies with Tom Johnston, not the blue-eyed soul mush from the Michael McDonald years).<P>

  <LI> Lynyrd Skynyrd/Doobie Brothers: 8 p.m. Thursday; Coral Sky Amphitheater, 601-7 Sansbury's Way, West Palm Beach; (407) 793-0445.<BR>
BRAZILIAN TRIBUTE<BR>
<LI> 8:30 tonight<BR>
at Gleason Theater.<BR>
<P>

   Bassist Israel ``Cachao'' Lopez and guitarist Stanley Jordan join three generations of Brazilian musicians, including singers Ed Motta, Leny Andrade, Dori and Danilo Caymmi, in a celebration of Brazilian popular music and a tribute to the late Antonio Carlos Jobim.<P>

   Jobim was ``a master, the pride of Brazil,'' says Motta. ``He was a unique voice that truly overcame borders.''<P>

  Motta burst onto the Brazilian pop music scene in the late '80s as an American-influenced soul singer but has been working lately ``in a Brazilian style, pretty much in the style of Jobim, Edu Lobo and Chico Buarque.''<P>

  Oddly, it was through jazz and Ravel and Debussy, Motta said, that he ``discovered the complexity and beauty of Brazilian music.''<P>

  Somewhere, Jobim, who once appropriated impressionism and cool jazz to shape bossa nova, must be chuckling.<P>

   <LI> A Tribute to Brazilian Music: 8:30 tonight; Jackie Gleason Theater, 1700 Washington Ave., Miami Beach; $16-$65; (305) 673-7300.<BR>
FACUNDO CABRAL<BR>
<LI> 8 p.m. Saturday at Gusman Center for the Performing Arts.<BR>
<P>

   Argentine folk singer and raconteur extraordinaire Facundo Cabral is a true original. His shows, full of humor and curious insights about anything from literature to sports, are part music events (he has a dark, rich voice) part performance art.<P>

   ``I remember the first work visa they gave me for the United States, in 1974, said: occupation: preacher,'' said Cabral in an interview from his home in Buenos Aires. ``I'm a storyteller, a talker, songs are for a change of pace. I'd say the word, the spoken word is what is most important in what I do.''<P>

  Cabral's 36-year career includes more than 160 records, several hit songs and shows in 164 countries. A man who spent eight years of self-imposed exile during the military dictatorship, he says he is sometimes associated to the politically tinged New Song movement, ``and it's a great mistake. What I do is very old. This is the first practice of literature: oral storytelling.''<P>

<LI> Facundo Cabral: 8 p.m. Saturday; Gusman Center for the Performing Arts, 174 E. Flagler St., Miami; $25, $30, $35; 59-8997 or 372-0925.
