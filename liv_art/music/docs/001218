<m0>(box) To the Faithful Departed<ql>
Island<m0><ep>
<m1><styl>txt<styl>ragx<ep>
<m0>   The title of the cranberries' third CD (out Tuesday) is derived from a Catholic prayer for the dead and it fits. There's a sense of loss, mourning and righteous anger pervading its songs about war (<m0>Bosnia<m0>),  a death in the family (<m0>Joe<m0>)  and the pop culture eulogy,<m0> I Just Shot John Lennon<m0>. <ep>
   Bracing guitars make the lead tracks <m0>Hollywood  <m0>and <m0>Salvation  <m0>land with a sharp slap. Two albums ago, it would have been unthinkable to expect this once-lightweight Irish group to produce convincing all-out rock. Starting with the aggressive 1994 single <m0>Zombie,  <m0>and a couple years of road tour experience, however, <m1> <m0>the cranberries have toughened while singer Dolores O'Riordan has become one of pop's more distinctive voices. She can rip into the seizing refrain of <m0>Salvation  <m0>with rabid abandon, and be a fetching flirt on the softer, girl-group pop of <m0>When You're Gone.<m0> <ep>
   The cranberries can't keep up the impressive quality after the album's bristling first half, though, and a song such as <m0>I Just Shot John Lennon<m0>  (which studiously avoids glorifying his killer) is ultimately more shocking for its title and concluding gunshots than any musical memorability.<ep>
   Still, the often tart <m0>Departed  <m0>is a solid step forward.<ep>

RCA<m0><ql>
<m1><styl>txt<styl>ragx<ep>
<m0>    Before 1994's <m0>Under the Table  and Dreaming  <m0>made them stars, members of the Dave Matthews Band were simply college radio residents (--) a fine spot, but not always known for its evolution. How else to explain Blues Traveler, Hootie or the Wings-meets-Red Hot Chili Peppers pop/funk of <m0>Too Much  <m0>found here and the somewhat dated jamming that turns much of <m0>Crash<m0>  into a more accomplished Grateful Dead-styled record?<ep>
   Granted, producer Steve Lillywhite reigns in the band's indulgent tendencies by shortening tracks into appealing pop morsels, and Leroi Moore's various saxophones land a mighty punch when multitracked on <m0>So Much To Say  <m0>or <m0>Too Much.<m0>  You'll admire the musicianship even as you note most of <m0>Crash  <m0>is borderline tuneless.<ep>
   Otherwise Matthews' vocals clone Eddie Vedder and he really doesn't have much to say aside from <m0>Say Goodbye<m0>'s<m0>  <m0>plea for a friend to become a lover for one night only.<ep>
   Expect <m0>Crash  <m0>(due Tuesday) to sell in the millions. A symbol of worthiness? Well, remember McDonald's sells a lot of hamburgers, too.<ep>

<m0>  Newcomer Jo Dee Messina reportedly spent a year selecting songs for this debut CD coproduced by country star Tim McGraw. The effort paid off; this is an assured collection of modern country tunes highlighted by the tuneful hit, <m0>Heads Carolina, Tails California<m0>. <ep>
   Messina exhibits none of McGraw's predilection for frivolous or mawkish material and, along with other rookies Mandy Barnett, Stephanie Bentley and Terri Clark, she's a new-breed female country artist with a strong future if she continues to choose her songs with care.<ep>

<m0>(box) Blow It Out Your A - - <ql>
It's Veruca Salt<ql>
DGC<m0><ql>
<m1><styl>txt<styl>ragx<ep>
<m0>   Last year Veruca Salt rode a massive paper trail of publicity pegged to its debut CD, <m0>American Thighs<m0>,<m0>  <m0>but that didn't translate into mega-sales as expected. Since a follow-up is not due until November, the Chicago alt-rockers test the waters with this new four-song EP.<m1><ep>
<m0>   The best thing about it is its snarky title. Producer Steve Albini (Nirvana, PJ Harvey), known for his minimalist, abrasive touch, gives the band a heavier sound and helps it deliver one standout track (--) the catchy <m0>Shimmer Like a Girl<m0>.<ep>
   Yet Veruca Salt's clever ideas often go unfulfilled. <m0>New York Mining Disaster 1996  <m0>is a play on the title of the Bee Gees' first Top 20 hit, 1967's <m0>New York Mining Disaster 1941,  <m0>but otherwise has nothing to do with that song. Why not a rocking cover or inspired update instead? That's the problem with this band, it teases but can't deliver for more than one or two tracks.<ep>

  God bless Iggy, still randy after all these years.<ep>
   On the appropriately titled <m0>Naughty Little Doggie<m0>,<m0>  <m0>Pop, who is pushing 50 yet still blessed with the vocals of a hormonal teen, lusts after Latino women and school-age girls and wants to be accepted, <m0>so there<m0>. He's got a scrappy band backing him, too, but there's little evidence of his '70s punk roots as leader of The Stooges or anything as memorable as <m0>China Girl<m0>,<m0>  <m0>a tune he wrote with David Bowie. This is merely accessible, nondescript, hard rock akin to an Alice Cooper record circa 1977. Take that as you will.<ep>
