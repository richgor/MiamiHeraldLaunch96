PANTERA<BR>
<LI> The Great Southern Trendkill<BR>
EastWest Records<BR>
  Here's more moshing fodder from one of America's most popular thrash/metal bands: Pantera.<P>

   The group's fourth release (in stores Tuesday) continues to showcase an act that is at best a poor man's Metallica -- muscular in the instrumental department, no doubt, but brain-dead at the mike or in musical invention. <P>

   These 11 new tracks will sandblast your ears with raging guitar and drum detonations and state-of-the-art production, but Metallica showed it's not wimpy to attempt  to sing or try new ideas in melody or sound. Here, brutal Pantera vocalist Philip Anselmo thinks screaming is a novel concept, so he wantonly roars throughout like a ranting Roseanne. There isn't an original thought to be found. <P>

   Trendkill  carries a parental advisory sticker warning about explicit lyrics, but why bother? Who could decipher Anselmo anyway? Listening to this whole silly thing is an endurance test.<BR>

MAXWELL<BR>
<LI> Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite<BR>
Columbia<BR>
<LI> You might like this if you like Marvin Gaye, Babyface, Terence Trent D'Arby.<P>

<P>

  A return to classic R&B/soul and a steamy make-out CD to boot. What a bargain.<P>

   Maxwell's debut harkens back to vintage LPs such as Marvin Gaye's 1973 ode to sex, Let's Get It On.  The similarly structured Urban Hang Suite's  11 tracks are to be taken as a whole, conjuring the sweep of a sexual encounter -- from initiation to consummation to afterglow. Maxwell's relaxed falsetto conveys lusty passion but isn't on par with Gaye's demanding carnal come-ons. After listening to Let's Get It On, you felt sweaty. Maxwell achieves this feeling once, on the lush . . . Til the Cops Come Knockin' (as in, ya' know, for days until someone notices they're missing. Oh my.)<P>

   Still, it's been so long since we've heard an R&B album with such an evocative, warm-blooded '70s quality (there's even the sound of a needle dropping on a scratchy record on the lead track, The Urban Theme), we have to give Maxwell a thumbs-up.<P>

BOMB THE BASS<BR>
<LI> Clear<BR>
Quango/Island<BR>
<LI> You might like this if you like Seal's first album.<P>

  Bomb the Bass' British remixer Tim Simenon offers a crazy quilt melange of hip-hop, techno, lite-reggae, acid-jazz, pop and pointy-headed pop cultural references on Clear.<P>

<P>

   Most of the time it works, thanks to a laid-back, flowing quality most electronic-based CDs lack. Highlights include the smoldering ballad Empire, which pairs guests Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor and Benjamin Zephaniah, who rhyme ``empire'' and ``vampire'' in a political tract against England. The hip-hop Braindead  is a pop culturist's manna as American rapper Justin Warfield drops lyrical references to cult filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, alt-rockers Veruca Salt and the Doors' Jim Morrison, among others.<P>

   It feels long, this CD, and a little tends to go a long way. Clear  is best heard in measured doses.<P>

HOWARD COHEN<BR>
THE TEMPTATIONS<BR>
<LI> ``One By One'' Anthology: The Best of Their Solo Years<BR>
Motown<BR>
  If you're a Tempt-o-phile, you'll surely flip for this new Temptations compilation, a collection of mostly hard-to-find solo tracks by members of Motown's most celebrated vocal group. The set is a perfect bookend to the similar Temptation's Anthology  of hits, perhaps even more coveted since it's the only place to find lost treasures such as Dennis Edwards' unreleased solo stuff from 1968, an obscure cut Paul Williams was working on just before his 1973 suicide (Feel Like Givin' Up  was its title, which might explain why it wasn't promoted then) and the full-length Eddie Kendricks hits Keep on Truckin'  (which featured a masterful production job to mask Kendricks' by-then weakened falsetto) and Boogie Down.<P>

HOWARD COHEN<BR>
MARIO RIVERA<BR>
<LI>  El Comandante<BR>
the merengue jazz<BR>
Groovin High<BR>
  Someone was bound to take a serious look at the possibilities of blending jazz and merengue, the Dominican Republic's infectious, fast-paced dance music. Perhaps encouraged by pop songwriter Juan Luis Guerra's successful, sophisticated update of merengue, veteran Dominican saxophonist Mario Rivera gives it a try with mixed success.<P>

   Pieces such as Frank's Tune  and John Lewis' Afternoon in Paris  are satisfying musically but a failure as fusion, sounding more like straight-ahead jazz pieces featuring tambora  (the typical merengue drum) and guira  (a metal scrapper). The same is true of the merengue-style version of the classic bolero En La Obscuridad.<P>

   The parts sound whole only in Dizzy Gillespie's Tanga,  the merengue pulse providing a distinct drive. Also included is straight-ahead jazz (Amigos Juntos, Have You Met Miss Jones?), a solid blues (Pretty Blues) and a workmanlike Brazilian samba (Todavia). Rivera, a longtime mainstay of Latin music records, finally gets his chance in the spotlight and shows what a fluid, soulful player he can be. But merengue jazz sounds better on paper than on record.<BR>
