LIVE AT THE EDGE: Alternative rock band Tripping Daisy draws a crowd on a Sunday night.<BR>

   The line outside is manageable, for a Friday night. It's only about 11, and the crush of club kids is still somewhere else, planning their evening on the edge.<P>

   Same scenario at clubs all over South Florida, but we're talking here about The Edge, the Fort Lauderdale rock spot that in less than five years has become the top alternative to who-you-know glitz and glam.<P>

   Crazy Courtney Love once hit the stage here, decked in ``kinderwhore'' garb, and offered a mosh-pit view of her dainty panties amid the roar of her band, Hole. A befuddled Deborah Harry, on stage last year, forgot the lyrics to her Blondie hit Call Me. And this night, the sunken cement dance floor soon will swell with men and women old enough to be your baby-sitter. Chain-link fences framing the dance floor will offer the fainter-hearted protection from the moshers to come when Stabbing Westward and No Doubt crank up on DJ Mike Sharpe's turntables.<P>

   The next night, at 4 a.m. Sunday, trippy dance music will take over for the weekly rave, the one that spills blissed-out 16-year-olds out into the streets in time for Sunday brunch.<P>

   Welcome to Alternative Ground Zero for South Florida, the nexus of the new-music scene, the place where up-and-coming bands connect with up-and-coming rock fans. The Foo Fighters played here. Collective Soul played here. Garbage, Bad Religion and the Toadies played here. Wednesday night, in another sold-out show, the Presidents of the United States of America will play here.<P>

   On ordinary nights, it's DJ Sharpe, who at 22 is just barely older than the average Edge patron, playing here. He cues up the cranberries' Salvation, an MTV-friendly song that lures a few college-age couples through the door, and pauses to talk about The Edge's appeal.<P>

   ``We are trying to stay on top of the alternative and play it before it gets on the radio,'' Sharpe says, cuing up a throbbing cut by The Prodigy. ``We want people to say, `I heard that at The Edge first.' ''<P>

  ``The other clubs, all they play is the same stuff over and over. Here they play unique stuff,'' says Gainesville student Tim Freddrick, 20.<P>

    Midnight is history and Sharpe is cruising, punching buttons, sliding CDs into trays, pumping up the volume. Rage Against the Machine's Bulls on Parade rattles out of speakers and crashes off the club's black walls. The energy level rises. People line the fences and watch others on the floor.<P>

   ``I'm not a real club person,'' patron Jennifer Isaacs hastens to mention. But Isaacs, 23, is here, the night before her wedding (hubby-to-be is home in Orlando). ``Other clubs play too much techno.''<P>

   So why The Edge? Where disparate acts nine inch nails and Bob Dylan (yes that Bob Dylan, who since he isn't on the radio anymore is now officially alternative) performed surprise warmup gigs for major shows elsewhere.<P>

   Sharisse Pessar, a concert promoter with Cellar Door who books acts into The Edge, says it's the club's ``cool atmosphere'' and ``alternative'' feel.<P>

SUBHEAD `The obvious place'<P>

   Staci Slater, who manages the Presidents of the United States of America out of her Los Angeles office, says The Edge was ``the obvious place'' for the band. ``The Presidents have never played Florida before. In most cities there are other choices, there wasn't any other place to be.'' <P>

   Atmosphere matters, as does size: The Edge is designed to hold about 1,000 people (2,000 for indoor-outdoor raves). Sunrise Musical Theatre's 4,000 seats, Bayfront Park Amphitheater's 6,000 and the Miami Arena's 15,000 are too many for a developing act such as the Presidents or Garbage to fill. Conversely, a small venue such as the Respectable Street Cafes in South Beach and West Palm Beach (each holds about 250) won't suffice, either. South Beach's Cameo is a comparable club aesthetically, favoring rock en espa&ntilde;ol and urban/dance acts, but South Beach being South Beach, Cameo enforces a VIP policy for some shows, restricting the upper level, where sightlines are best. At the more user-friendly Edge we're all the same; one bunch bound by a beat.<P>

   Nirvana's Come As You Are blares suddenly and it's apt. Jeans-wearing Yaniv Offir, 19, a banker in Fort Lauderdale, suggests The Edge's relaxed dress code is a real plus. ``When you go to hip-hop clubs you have to dress,'' he says. ``Here you wear whatever you want.'' Jeans and T's are the basics. Black, bustiers, and body piercings? Killer. Come on in.<P>

   Here it is 1 a.m., and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' hot My Friends wafts out of the bustling main room and into the pool table area, where Pompano Beach student Rebecca Ford, 20, studies the action. ``You get in cheap [$15 tops for most concerts], and this was the only under-18 club when I was that age,'' she offers. OK, so now that she's beyond that age? ``They have a big dance floor and cool music.''<P>

   You can't get much cooler than Garbage.<P>

   ``Garbage had one of the best counts in the country here,'' Pessar said. ``The kids are open to hearing these acts even though they are one-hit bands.''<P>

<B>SUBHEAD:</B> Loud and rowdy<P>

  And the kids aren't shy about voicing their support. Loudly. Out in the street. City code inspectors shut down the club for several weeks early last year citing missing exit signs, lighting and other safety problems -- and the city's Downtown Development Authority and police warned the club to clamp down on rowdy behavior by patrons. The club responded with more security guards inside and out, and the heat's off for now.<P>

   ``Gave us the chance to clean up the club,'' smiles Sharpe as he points toward other improvements: new pink lights casting eerie glows on the walls, and a mammoth laser rig perched above the stage, set to hypnotize Sunday-morning ravers.<P>

   But the temporary shutdown hurt attendance, says Edge representative Michael O'Brien. ``We've gone through a downturn, put together some great concerts, got the vibe out again, and we're on the radio constantly,'' he boasts. ``A tremendous number of clubs came around and we had to compete . . . we've met our matches and are starting to climb again.''<P>

   ``Everyone has heard The Edge's name,'' says DJ Sharpe.<P>

   It's early Sunday morning, and the trance music pulsates in, pushing Ministry and the rest out. Bars stop serving alcohol (you have to be only 16 to get in for raves), and the pink lights go dim.<P>

   The alternative rock bunch departs in droves and younger teens in denim and nose rings, taunted by the techno music and sashaying strobes, chill on the trippy sound.<P>

   The last song of the night -- er, day? Always Duran Duran's downbeat Save a Prayer as in:<P>

   Don't say a prayer for me now/Save it 'til the morning after.<P>

   A perfect tonic to come down off the buzz. Time for lunch.
