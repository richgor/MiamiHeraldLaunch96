  Tashi, the chamber group that began life two decades ago in association with pianist Peter Serkin and now tours with clarinetist Richard Stoltzman, capped the Friends of Chamber Music's season Monday night at the University of Miami with a concert of serene quintet music for clarinet and strings.<ep>
  Except for the Weber Clarinet Quintet, which was a bit perky, everything programmed had an autumnal quality, starting with the brief <m0>Intermede<m0>  from Messiaen's <m0>Quartet From the End of Time<m0>. Tchaikovsky's <m0>Herbstlied<m0>, arranged by Toru Takemitsu, commemorated the recently deceased Japanese composer.<ep>
  But it would have been a far more meaningful tribute to play a composition by Takemitsu rather than just one of his transcriptions of Tchaikovsky's music. But there was little to quibble about the performances, except perhaps for Stoltzman's extremely ``laid-back'' approach to the Weber finale.<ep>
  To be sure, he is a masterful player with the most seamless, silky, creamy clarinet tone, and he spun out the dreamy Brahms Quintet with apt mellowness, bolstered beautifully by Tashi's stellar strings: Ida Kavafian and Theodore Arm, violins; Steven Tenenbom, viola, and Fred Sherry, cello.<ep>
  Their Brahms spoke directly to the <m1> <m0>mind and heart. But the Weber, though often eloquent, would have benefited from a bit more vitality, rather than putting so much emphasis on its lyrical line. With Stoltzman's unvarying suavity dominating, you sometimes felt there wasn't enough overall contrast in mood.<ep>
