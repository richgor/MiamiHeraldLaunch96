   SunFest '96, a major art and music festival, promises to draw almost 300,000 people to Flagler along the Intracoastal Waterway throughout its five days. Where else can you see a fireworks display before July 4th, munch on mega-foodstuffs and keep the kids busy with hands-on activities, puppet and magic shows and art displays.<ep>
   But if God were <m0>One of Us  <m0>he'd a) be tired of that song, or b) check out its singer, headlining act, Joan Osborne. Here's a look at her and some SunFest featured performers this week:<ep>

<m0>JOAN OSBORNE<m0><ep>
<m0>(box) <m1> <m0>9:15 p.m. Thursday on the NationsBank Stage<m0><ep>
<m1><styl>txt<styl>ragx<ep>
<m0>   This has been quite the year for newcomer Osborne. She was recently up for five Grammy awards pegged to her major label debut album, <m0>Relish<m0>,<m0>  <m0>and <m0>that  <m0>song about a God with human qualities. OK, she left the ceremonies empty-handed, but hey, the exposure helped <m0>Relish  <m0>reach two million in sales and landed her sexy <m0>Right Hand Man  <m0>video on MTV. Osborne, a New Yorker with a bluesy voice, says she's a bit disappointed with <m0>Relish  <m0>(--) too produced and polished. She's said her follow-up will really showcase her vocal abilities, and as a live act she's known to be quite hot.<ql>
<m0>THE BAND<m0><ep>
<m0>  <m0>(box) 8:30 p.m. Wednesday on the NationsBank Stage.<m0><ep>
<m1><styl>txt<styl>ragx<ep>
<m0>  The veteran (mostly) Canadian rockers may be Robbie Robertson-less these days, but that hasn't stopped them from optimistically titling their latest CD <m1> <m0>High on the Hog.  <m0>If you liked rootsy '60s Band-fare such as <m0>Up on Cripple Creek  <m0>or <m0>The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down  <m0>(we still say Joan Baez owns that song, sorry guys) you should like the new CD, even if it does feature yet <m0>another  <m0>reworking of Bob Dylan's <m0>Forever Young<m0>,<m0>  <m0>a tune rapidly approaching <m0>Feelings  <m0>in appeal.<ql>
<m0>MARY KARLZEN<m0><ep>
 <m0>(box) <m1> <m0>6 p.m. Thursday on the Fidelity Federal Stage.<m0><ep>
<m0>   ``Who can turn the world on with a smile . . . '' Oops, wrong song, but appropriate. If you've seen Mary, you like Mary. There's just something about this singer/songwriter and her confessional pop/rock songs that endears. Atlantic Records released her major label debut, <m0>Yelling at Mary<m0>,<m0>  <m0>last year and didn't do enough to make sure everyone heard it. Let's hope her forthcoming summer release gets more attention.<ql>
<m0>LISA LOEB & NINE STORIES<m0><ep>
  <m0>(box) 8 p.m. Thursday on the Fidelity Federal Stage.<m0><ep>
<m0>   Actually there's one story here: a song by the name of <m0>Stay,  <m0>which was featured in the 1994 flop flick <m0>Reality Bites.  <m0>The quiet pop song became a No. 1 single before the bespectacled Loeb even had a label deal. Its success launched a bidding war and Geffen snapped her up and released the full-length CD, <m0>Tails,  <m0>last year to moderate acceptance.<ep>
