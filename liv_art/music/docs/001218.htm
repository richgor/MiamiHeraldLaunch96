NEW FROM CRANBERRIES:Convincing all-out rock from a once-lightweight group. <BR>
<BR>
DAVE MATTHEWS BAND: Not much to say. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

JO DEE MESSINA: An assured collection of modern country tunes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

cranberries rock<BR>
<BR>

...more of same<BR>
<BR>

from Matthews<BR>
<BR>

...naughty Iggy<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the cranberries<BR>
<LI> To the Faithful Departed<BR>
Island<P>

   The title of the cranberries' third CD (out Tuesday) is derived from a Catholic prayer for the dead and it fits. There's a sense of loss, mourning and righteous anger pervading its songs about war (Bosnia),  a death in the family (Joe)  and the pop culture eulogy, I Just Shot John Lennon. <P>

   Bracing guitars make the lead tracks Hollywood  and Salvation  land with a sharp slap. Two albums ago, it would have been unthinkable to expect this once-lightweight Irish group to produce convincing all-out rock. Starting with the aggressive 1994 single Zombie,  and a couple years of road tour experience, however, the cranberries have toughened while singer Dolores O'Riordan has become one of pop's more distinctive voices. She can rip into the seizing refrain of Salvation  with rabid abandon, and be a fetching flirt on the softer, girl-group pop of When You're Gone. <P>

   The cranberries can't keep up the impressive quality after the album's bristling first half, though, and a song such as I Just Shot John Lennon  (which studiously avoids glorifying his killer) is ultimately more shocking for its title and concluding gunshots than any musical memorability.<P>

   Still, the often tart Departed  is a solid step forward.<P>

DAVE MATTHEWS BAND<BR>
<LI> Crash<BR>
RCA<BR>
    Before 1994's Under the Table  and Dreaming  made them stars, members of the Dave Matthews Band were simply college radio residents -- a fine spot, but not always known for its evolution. How else to explain Blues Traveler, Hootie or the Wings-meets-Red Hot Chili Peppers pop/funk of Too Much  found here and the somewhat dated jamming that turns much of Crash  into a more accomplished Grateful Dead-styled record?<P>

   Granted, producer Steve Lillywhite reigns in the band's indulgent tendencies by shortening tracks into appealing pop morsels, and Leroi Moore's various saxophones land a mighty punch when multitracked on So Much To Say  or Too Much.  You'll admire the musicianship even as you note most of Crash  is borderline tuneless.<P>

   Otherwise Matthews' vocals clone Eddie Vedder and he really doesn't have much to say aside from Say Goodbye's  plea for a friend to become a lover for one night only.<P>

   Expect Crash  (due Tuesday) to sell in the millions. A symbol of worthiness? Well, remember McDonald's sells a lot of hamburgers, too.<P>

JO DEE MESSINA<BR>
<LI> Jo Dee Messina<BR>
Curb<BR>
<LI> You might like this if you like Reba McEntire, Wynonna, Dolly Parton.<P>

  Newcomer Jo Dee Messina reportedly spent a year selecting songs for this debut CD coproduced by country star Tim McGraw. The effort paid off; this is an assured collection of modern country tunes highlighted by the tuneful hit, Heads Carolina, Tails California. <P>

   Messina exhibits none of McGraw's predilection for frivolous or mawkish material and, along with other rookies Mandy Barnett, Stephanie Bentley and Terri Clark, she's a new-breed female country artist with a strong future if she continues to choose her songs with care.<P>

HOWARD COHEN<BR>
VERUCA SALT<BR>
<LI> Blow It Out Your A - - <BR>
It's Veruca Salt<BR>
DGC<BR>
   Last year Veruca Salt rode a massive paper trail of publicity pegged to its debut CD, American Thighs,  but that didn't translate into mega-sales as expected. Since a follow-up is not due until November, the Chicago alt-rockers test the waters with this new four-song EP.<P>

   The best thing about it is its snarky title. Producer Steve Albini (Nirvana, PJ Harvey), known for his minimalist, abrasive touch, gives the band a heavier sound and helps it deliver one standout track -- the catchy Shimmer Like a Girl.<P>

   Yet Veruca Salt's clever ideas often go unfulfilled. New York Mining Disaster 1996  is a play on the title of the Bee Gees' first Top 20 hit, 1967's New York Mining Disaster 1941,  but otherwise has nothing to do with that song. Why not a rocking cover or inspired update instead? That's the problem with this band, it teases but can't deliver for more than one or two tracks.<P>

HOWARD COHEN<BR>
IGGY POP<BR>
<LI> Naughty Little Doggie<BR>
Virgin<BR>
   <P>

  God bless Iggy, still randy after all these years.<P>

   On the appropriately titled Naughty Little Doggie,  Pop, who is pushing 50 yet still blessed with the vocals of a hormonal teen, lusts after Latino women and school-age girls and wants to be accepted, so there. He's got a scrappy band backing him, too, but there's little evidence of his '70s punk roots as leader of The Stooges or anything as memorable as China Girl,  a tune he wrote with David Bowie. This is merely accessible, nondescript, hard rock akin to an Alice Cooper record circa 1977. Take that as you will.<P>
