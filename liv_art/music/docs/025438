Elektra/Fiction<ep>
<m1><styl>txt<styl>ragx<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   It is a different decade, another lineup and the first studio album from The Cure in four years, so singer/songwriter Robert Smith goes for broke (--) and succeeds. Not only does he concern himself with something and someone outside himself (surprise) but he zigs and zags away from The Cure's familiar, goth synth-pop flashing Indian sitars and string quartets, calypso grooves and jazz. He sets off with the lush, densely layered <m0>Want;<m0> there is even a moment for tenderness in <m0>Treasure,<m0> then he vamps his way, brass section in tow, through the vaguely Caribbean <m0>The 13th,<m0> (did someone say David Byrne?) swings (OK, <m0>almost<m0> swings) in the jazzy <m0>Gone,<m0> and goes downright silly with joy in <m0>Mint Car. <m0>And, of course, there is the requisite touch of gloom and despair (<m0>Numb)<m0> and cries about being ``sick of it all'' (<m0>Trap)<m0>. It will be interesting to see how hard-core fans react, but it looks like <m0>Wild Mood Swings <m0>might solidify The Cure's status as an oxymoron: a popular cult band.<ep>

<m0>(box) Older<ql>
DreamWorks/SKG<m0><ql>
<m1><styl>txt<styl>ragx<ql>
<ep>
<m0>  There's a lot riding on George Michael's comeback bid. After a six-year absence sparked by his bitter lawsuit against former label Sony, Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg rode to the rescue with a multimillion-dollar buyout of his contract, signing Michael as the flagship artist for their new DreamWorks/SKG.<ep>
   The oft-delayed <m0>Older <m0>(in stores Tuesday) is the first release on that new label, and the company has its work cut out for it. Gone are the marketable hip-shaking hooks of the frothy <m0>Faith, <m0>which sent sales soaring in the late '80s. In their place is a brooding, reflective, older <m0>and <m0>wiser sound from a songwriter who now sacrifices catchy melodies for mood.<ep>
   Alternating between light dance grooves (the current single <m0>Fastlove <m0>with its probing sax, seductive refrain and sample of Patrice Rushen's 1982 hit <m0>Forget Me Nots, <m0>is a highlight) and primarily cushiony ballads (in the vein of <m0>Jesus to a Child<m0>),<m0> <m0>Michael's aim here is to seduce.<ep>
<m1><styl>cxon<m2> <ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Lyrically, <m0>Fastlove<m0>'s<m0> <m0>plea for a one-night-stand is a tamer rehash of his 1987 hit <m0>I Want Your Sex <m0>but sounds controversial in these sexually fearful times. Yet the true adult nature of <m0>Older <m0>lies in Michael's predominant use of a breathy come-hither voice as he sighs the up-tempo chorus of <m0>Spinning the Wheel <m0>(a latter-day Bee Gees' sound alike), teases amid a James Bondish aura on the title track, or coos the tender ballad <m0>You Have Been Loved<m0>. <m0>Older <m0>works its charms slowly, yet slithers under your skin.<ep>
   Will it help sell millions of records? Probably not. But it's a solid step toward maturity.<ep>

<m0>(box) You've Got to Believe<ql>
in Something<ql>
Epic<m0><ql>
<m1><styl>txt<styl>ragx<ql>
<ep>
<m0>  After <m0>Pocket Full of Kryptonite <m0>took off in 1991, the Spin Doctors committed the cardinal sin of believing the group could do no wrong. Arrogance, a careless follow-up (1994's<m0> Turn It Upside Down<m0>), and sloppy concerts defined the band. When <m0>Upside Down <m0>bombed, Spin Doctors seemed ready for the has-been bin.<ep>
   Suitably chastened and with a solid new lead guitarist, the Spin Doctors return Tuesday with a likable third studio CD; a casual effort that, after the debacle of the past, feels refreshing. The CD kicks off with scratchy ragtime piano and a sing-song hook on the title track; it's one of the group's catchiest songs. Throughout, there are musical echoes of drug-era Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and an unnecessary rock jam of K.C. & the Sunshine Band's <m0>That's the Way (I Like It) <m0>with guest rapper Biz Markie hidden as a bonus cut. <m0>Home<m0>,<m0> <m0>with its gimmicky backward-drum sound effect, addresses the band's fall from grace: <m0>Came up so fast, gave me the bends / Now I'm staring into a camera lens / From rags to riches and back again<m0>.<ep>
   <m0>You've Got to Believe in Something <m0>isn't a masterpiece, but the healing has begun.<ep>

<m0>(box) New Beginning<ql>
RCA<m0><ql>
<m1><styl>txt<styl>ragx<ep>
<m0>  This R&B trio certainly won't earn points for originality. Tracy Chapman's current CD is also titled <m0>New Beginning<m0> and Chapman got there first. Besides, what ``new beginning'' is SWV (--) that's Sisters With Voices (--) suggesting? SWV hasn't been around long enough to require one.<ep>
   Amid mostly mediocre material there's commercial R&B fare wedding hip-hop beats to soulful vocals, yet the singing is all too often bogged down in overly processed arrangements. Nevertheless, percolating songs such as the rhythmic <m0>You're the One<m0> (a recent No. 1 R&B hit) or the Sly & the Family Stonelike hook of <m0>It's All About U <m0>poke through the synthesizers.<ep>
