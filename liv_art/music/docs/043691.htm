By PETER WHORISKEY<BR>
Herald Architecture Writer<P>

     This is good news or bad news, depending on where you live.<P>

   The new Coral Sky Amphitheatre opens tonight in West Palm Beach, kicking off a schedule that features some of pop music's biggest names: Sting, Natalie Merchant, Ozzy Osbourne, Steely Dan and more.<P>

   These acts once might have played a stage within an easy drive of Dade and Broward homes -- at Miami Arena, or Sunrise Musical Theater, or Bayfront Amphitheater. But now, for much of South Florida, the music will play an hour or more away.<P>

   The question concertgoers in Dade and Broward will be asking is this: Is it worth the haul? Here's an educated guess:<P>

      the Coral Sky Amphitheatre looks and feels like a small ballpark, unpretentious and comfortable, and not a spectacle. It cost about $11 million to build.<P>

   The building that contains the stage is basically a five-story box clad in corrugated steel. Jutting out over the stage is a steel-frame canopy sheltering 7,000 blue plastic flip-down seats, something like a grandstand at a baseball stadium. Beyond the seats, and open to the sky, lies a man-made hill. This ``festival lawn'' can accommodate 13,000 more people. <P>

   ``The basic rule was keep it simple,'' said Bill Tracy, an architect with MJA Architectural Services of Palm Beach Gardens. ``The buildings do not draw attention to themselves. The people will make it festive.''<P>

   Compare it, for example, to Miami Arena. The new venue is thousands of seats bigger, with room for almost 20,000 fans. Coral Sky seating is more hospitable to music performances, with sightlines arranged for a stage rather than a basketball court. And finally, of course, it's open to the air. The damp, hot summer air of South Florida.<P>

   Little of that, however, will touch performers. Designers have aimed a huge AC at the stage, powerful enough to cool about 25 homes, and that thermal cool is expected to spill over the first 10 rows of fans. <P>

   Anyone feeling thirsty? There is a large concession plaza on each side of the stage. Like those at small ballparks, they consist of concrete-block shacks. The cuisine matches: beer, tropical frozen drinks, pizza, sausages, burgers. Food items range from $2 to $5.25; beer is $3 to $4.50.<P>

   Ticket prices will vary widely. Tickets for tonight's concert -- featuring BTO, Survivor and Edgar Winter -- cost $12 for reserved seating, $8 for the lawn. Pretty cheap. But check out prices for Sting and Natalie Merchant in June: Reserved seating costs $30 to $50, and a spot on the lawn will go for $20 ($2 will be added for parking).<P>

   It's too early to judge Coral Sky's acoustical quality -- no one has played there. But designers of the amphitheater -- a venture of Sony Music, Blockbuster Entertainment and PACE Entertainment, in association with Cellar Door Concerts -- say the sound will please fans, particularly in comparison to arena acoustics.<P>

   As for the audience on the lawn, there are 16 extra speakers -- as well as two 9-by-12-foot video screens. Lawnspeakers will be on delay, so sound will reach listeners at the same time as sound from the stage. ``It's pretty sophisticated -- you won't hear an echo,'' Tracy said. ``It won't be like hearing the pope in Miami.''<P>
