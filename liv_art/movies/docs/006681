<m0>   Mulholland Falls<m0> (R)<ep>
   <m0>Best for: <m0>Adults only<ep>
   <m0>Watch out for<m0>: Lots of profanity, nudity, explicit sexual situations, violence, adult issues<ep>
   <m0>What happens<m0>: This is a drama about four no-nonsense cops in an elite unit of the LAPD in the early 1950s. They make their own rules and get away with it until a routine murder reveals some dark secrets. While the cast is <m1> <m0>impressive (--) Nick Nolte, Melanie Griffith, Chazz Palminteri, Chris Penn and John Malkovich (--) the movie is a disappointment. Nolte smokes so many cigarettes it's as if he's doing a tobacco commercial.<ep>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>The Pallbearer <m0>(PG-13)<ql>
<m1>   <ep>
<m0>   Best for: <m0>Ages 12 and up. David Schwimmer has a multitude of fans from the television series <m0>Friends<m0>, so children this age will definitely want to go.<ep>
<m0>   Watch out for: <m0>There is a suicide involved, although it's only discussed, not shown. Discreet sex scenes.<ep>
   <m0>What happens:<m0> Tom Thompson (Schwimmer) is a 25-ish architect schlump who lives at home with Mom (Carol Kane) and can't find work. He spends Tuesday nights bowling with his pals. Then he gets a phone call from a distressed mother (Barbara Hershey) who tells him that her son, his old schoolmate Bill has committed suicide. She asks Tom to be a pallbearer. The problem is that he cannot remember Bill. Nonetheless, he has a fling with Mrs. Abernathy, and he begins romancing an old schoolmate (Gwyneth Paltrow). <m1> <m0>Predictable complications ensue.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
   <m1><ep>
<m0>   The Truth About Cats & Dogs<m0> (PG-13)<ep>
   <m0>Best for: <m0>Adults and teens 15 and up. The message that looks can be deceiving is delivered with bright dialogue and could be a good lesson for older teens. But this is an adult comedy (--) definitely not for children or younger teens.<ep>
   <m0>Watch out for: <m0>Some profanity, adult situations involving drinking. While there is no nudity, a none-too-discreet phone-sex scene may offend some.<ep>
   <m0>What happens:<m0> In this modern, feminist twist on Cyrano de Bergerac, the witty but not glamorous radio show veterinarian Abby Barnes (Janeane Garofalo) finds that one of her callers Brian (Ben Chaplin), a photographer, has fallen for her (--) over the radio. Abby decides to describe her appearance as that of her beautiful <m1> <m0>neighbor Noelle (Uma Thurman), and trouble arises when Brian decides to meet the girl of his dreams. A delightful romantic<m0> adult<m0> comedy.<ep>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<m0>   <ep>
  <m0>(box) <m0>The Birdcage <m0>(R) (--) <m0>There's no explicit sex, but because of this movie's adult subject matter and language (--) one of the main characters owns a drag club in South Beach (--) this is best for older teens, who'll enjoy the silliness and maybe learn a thing or two about acceptance.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
   <m1><ep>
<m0>   (box) Celtic Pride<m0> <m0>(PG-13)<m0> (--) Mike O'Hara (Daniel Stern) and Jimmy Flaherty (Dan Aykroyd), two rabid Boston Celtics fans masquerading as dumb and dumber, kidnap Lewis Scott (Damon Wayans), an arrogant, ice-cool, ball-hogging Utah Jazz star, to keep him from playing in the championship game. But Scott escapes, threatening to send his kidnappers to jail unless they root for the Jazz. The movie clearly is aimed for young kids, but it is not appropriate for them, with its profanity and fisticuffs.<ep>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<m0>   <ep>
   <m0>(box) <m0>Executive Decision <m0>(R) (--) <m0>Terrorist drama is filled with violence (--) several people are shot, a woman is hit by a terrorist and one man is sucked out of the airplane. But none of it is graphic. Might be OK for <m1> <m0>teens 13 and up.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
   <ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box)<m0> A Family Thing <m0>(PG-13) (--)<m0> Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones are a Southern bigot and his newly discovered black half-brother. Too much talk for most kids. Mature teens can learn from the message of tolerance. There's an abundance of adult issues <m1> <m0>and dialogue that's blunt but effective.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
   <ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>Flirting With Disaster <m0>(R)<m0> <m0>(--)<m0> For parents who think it's fine for teens to laugh at obnoxious moms and dads, drug use, adultery and comic sexual situations, this movie should provide plenty of dinner-table conversation. <m1><ql>
<styl>vs,3<ql>
   <ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>James and the Giant Peach <m0>(PG)<m0> <m0>(--) <m0>This 80-minute film version of the Roald Dahl children's classic turns the fantastical voyage of a lonely orphan boy who escapes from two wicked aunts by going aloft in a large peach manned by insects into a wonderful collage of color, humor, innocence and life lessons. Its mix of <m1> <m0>stop-motion animation and <m1> <m0>live action will mesmerize kids (especially those 6 to 13) (--) and adults. Some of the early live-action scenes (--) when James loses his parents to a giant rhinoceros and ends up being tortured by two scary aunts (--) may fuel younger kids' nightmares. <m1><ql>
<styl>vs,3<ql>
   <ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>Jane Eyre <m0>(PG) (--) <m0>The slow pacing will provoke a few yawns, but young viewers who are discovering Charlotte Bronte's classic novel will be impressed by the film's fidelity. And the story of an abused child who grows into a woman of strength and resolve has automatic appeal.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<m1><ep>
<m0>   (box) <m0>Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy (<m0>R) (--) <m0>The humor is aimed at the mind of a middle-school kid (--) though parents may balk at letting kids that young see this because of its profanity, <m1> <m0>nudity, homoerotic film clips and simulated masturbation. Older teens will probably be bored (--) unless they think <m0>Beavis and Butt-head<m0> is too subtle.<ep>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>Oliver & Company <m0>(G)<m0> <m0>(--)<m0> This animated musical version of <m0>Oliver Twist <m0>portrays Oliver (voiced by Joey Lawrence) as an abandoned kitten and the Artful Dodger (Billy Joel) as a wily hound. The mangiest types, though, are humans. For sensitive 3- to 5-year-olds, this may be too scary. Kids 6 to 10 will love the action. Older kids will also find plenty to laugh at.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>  <m0>(box) Primal Fear<m0> (R)<m0> (--) <m1> <m0>This is an intense, adult drama, with nudity, profanity and adult issues. Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a hotshot defense lawyer for Aaron (Edward Norton), a runaway accused of murdering a sexually abusive archbishop in Chicago. When the case goes to trial, Vail discovers that Aaron isn't what he appears to be.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
   <m1><ep>
<m0>   (box) Sgt. Bilko (PG) <m0>(--) The zaniness of Steve Martin's title character will very likely appeal to kids as young as 5, but his tongue-in-cheek humor may go over the heads of all but the most sophisticated of those younger kids. Best for kids 10 and up. Watch out for: a few mild expletives and a repetitious plot, which may bore the kids.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0> (box) Mrs. Winterbourne<m0> <m0>(PG-13) (--) <m0>Teens should find plenty of chuckles in this <m1> <m0>comedy about mistaken identify and love, starring Ricki Lake. The rating is for some profanity. Sophisticated kids 9-12 may enjoy the humor. For younger kids, the initial train wreck will probably be upsetting, and they'll be confused.<ep>
