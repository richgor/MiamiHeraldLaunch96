<m0>  Just when you think you've seen it all, along comes a movie like <m0>Naked Killer <m0>to prove you wrong. This Hong Kong import might be the best serial-killing kung-fu-fighting gunslinging softcore-lesbian-dominatrix movie ever made: If you can't find <m0>something <m0>here to offend you, you're just not paying attention.<ep>
   It's the story of Kitty (Chingmy Yau), a young and cheerful man-killer who becomes the apprentice of Sister Cindy (Kelly Yao), a resourceful Black Widow-type who executes rapists and murderers with her flying knives, head-crushing dropkicks (--) and, when all else fails, her arsenal of guns.<ep>
   Kitty proves such a talented student, she grabs the attention of Princess (Carrie Ng) and her girl-toy Baby (Svenwara Madoka), two castrating, man-hating lesbians who decide to wipe out their new competition (they can't stand anyone stealing their tabloid headlines).<ep>
   But Princess soon develops a crush on Kitty, which leaves Baby fuming with jealousy. Meanwhile, Kitty fawns over Tinam (Simon Yam), an impotent cop who, after meeting Kitty, now wakes up each morning with a ``priapism.'' All the lovey-dovey stuff begins to annoy Sister Cindy (``Killer can't fall in <m0>love<m0>! Once she is in love, she can't kill with barbarity!'') It's only a matter of time before all proverbial hell breaks loose.<ep>
   <m0>Naked Killer <m0>more than lives up to its title: There's a lot of killing in it, and there's a lot of naked flesh, too (some of that flesh isn't always alive, either; one of the movie's setpieces involves a search for a severed male part mixed up in a tray of breakfast sausages.) Like most Hong Kong films, the story moves like lightning, maybe a little <m0>too <m0>quickly: The plot rarely slows down for anything resembling characterization, and all the bodacious leather-clad murderesses are sometimes hard to tell apart. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Director Clarence Fok revs the action up to near-hysterical levels: One gunfight, set in a parking garage where Sister Cindy and Kitty battle an army of men, is so frantically edited it registers on a near-subliminal level. The speed delivers a giddy rush, though it'd be even better if you could actually follow what was going on.<ep>
   The movie also has a twisted sense of humor that gleefully ignores any vestige of taste: When Sister Cindy first recruits Kitty, she locks her in a basement with a drooling rapist to test her mettle. Later, Kitty gets revenge by locking Cindy in the same cellar with <m0>two <m0>madmen; when Cindy disposes of both without so much as mussing her hair, Kitty gushes, ``I admire you <m0>so much<m0>!''<ep>
   OK, so it's all pretty dumb. But it's also kinetic and wildly outrageous (--) and, in the end, even romantic and sentimental. <m0>Naked Killer <m0>doesn't always make sense, but it's certainly got attitude: These chicks could teach even Sharon Stone a few new tricks with that icepick of hers.<ql>
