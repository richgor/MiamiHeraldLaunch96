<m0>ive Sharon Stone this: She knows who she is.<ep>
   ``I just don't figure that my role here is to make things easy for anyone,'' Stone says flatly. ``If you can't handle that, then you can't handle me. But if you can, we can usually make something happen.''<ep>
   It is, after all, Sharon Stone, who maybe lost the Academy Award to Susan Sarandon, who maybe makes a half-million dollars less per picture than Demi Moore, but who still is the biggest female movie star in the United States and perhaps the only one who might be able to open a film like <m0>Last Dance<m0>. If <m0>Casino<m0> was Stone's opportunity to show the world she is something more than a celluloid aphrodisiac, <m0>Last Dance<m0> is her shot at showing she can do it without the sex.<ep>
   ``Hey, I'm not stupid,'' says Stone, letting you know she knows you know she isn't. ``This is not the kind of role that someone reads and says `I know, let's go out and get Sharon Stone!' ''<ep>
   Which is why Stone wanted to play Cindy Liggett, a convicted killer awaiting execution in some unnamed Southern state with a governor who has never granted clemency. Therefore, when a naive state lawyer, played by Rob Morrow, shows up offering hope of clemency or a stay, Cindy thinks him a fool. But he persists, and eventually the two form a relationship that changes both their lives in unexpected ways.<ep>
   Or not so unexpected, in the wake of the acclaimed <m0>Dead Man Walking<m0>, for which Sarandon won the Academy Award that could have gone to Stone. In <m0>Last Dance<m0>, the sex of the convict and the convict's champion have been reversed, but the tale itself is strikingly similar. Stone says she was unaware of the other project when she took the role, but would have taken the part anyway.<ep>
   ``Bruce [director Bruce Beresford] came to see me in Las Vegas when I was shooting <m0>Casino<m0>, which was the most demanding, exhaustive work I had ever done,'' says Stone. ``And reading the script, I had no doubt that playing a character like Cindy Liggett was going to be every bit as difficult. So I was naturally wary, and just as amazed as anyone else would be that he would think of me for the part. The obvious question was, `Why me?' Bruce said, `Because I want to make my job as easy as possible.'<ep>
   ``He believed in me so much more than I do, and when you have that kind of trust from someone, you can do the work of which you are capable. Sounds so simple, doesn't <m2><ql>

<m0>it? You'd think more directors would try it.''<ep>
   ``Sure, I know that on occasions people have been intimidated by the force of my personality, or what they believe about me, but my job is not to make them feel safe and secure. My job is to do the best work I can, no matter what it takes to get there. The best directors I have worked with, Marty [Martin Scorsese], Bruce and Mark Rydell, are all people who are confident enough with themselves and their vision to use simple honesty. These are people who will let you follow your instincts, try what you think is right, and then say `Honey, that's not the way to go. Now try this, and you might get there.'<ep>
   ``It's my experience that you really can't lose when you try the truth. There's a shocking revelation: When in doubt, go for the truth.''<ep>
<m1>Death row research<ep>
<m0>   Stone said that was her beacon when searching for the soul of Liggett, who she says was a composite of ``three or four actual cases, and some of the people I saw and met.'' Her research included watching a documentary on female death row inmates, and then talking to some convicted killers. At Tennessee State Prison, where some of the scenes were filmed, Stone was locked down in maximum security, an experience she calls, with some intended irony, ``enlightening.''<ep>
   ``I went into the film with ambiguity, feeling unclear as to what was appropriate,'' Stone says, regarding her personal views on capital punishment. ``I didn't come out that way. It wasn't just playing the part of a character who was going to be executed, either, it was coming to terms with a system that sanctions killing those who have crossed that line to kill someone else. In the case of Cindy, she was not the same person who has committed those terrible crimes. Prison was the first safe and consistent place she had ever been in her life, and in that environment, she was able to see who she was and what she was capable of. Then they want to kill her.''<ep>
   Stone says she surprised Beresford and the crew when she showed up on the set ready to work: She had already mastered a Tennessee accent. She also had gone to her Madison Avenue hair stylist and ordered her to cut her hair ``really badly.''<ep>
   ``The first time, she couldn't bear to completely do it,'' Stone recalls, laughing. ``She got about two-thirds of the way there, so I made her do it again.'' Stone also had dyed her hair a shade she refers to as Ozark brown.<ep>
<m1>`Diabolique' tensions<ep>
<m0>   After <m0>Last Dance<m0>, Stone returned to Pennsylvania, where she was born in 1958, to make <m0>Diabolique<m0>, an experience that turned out to be less than satisfying. After she balked at doing a nude scene the producer said was contractually required, tensions ran high on the set.<ep>
   When the film was released last month, Stone declined to publicize it. Indeed, the only time during this interview Stone shows any of that famous bristle is when the word ``contract'' comes up: ``I'm not going there,'' she says. ``This is supposed to be about <m0>Last Dance<m0>.''<ep>
      But she also knows that any Stone interview is about Stone, and is aware of her ability to polarize the public.<ep>
   ``Actually, I think it's that level of fame that polarizes people,'' says Stone. ``The perception at that level tends to be larger than life, so everything you do is exaggerated. But I'm telling you, whether it's you or me or Bob Smith, if you're one of those people who fills a room when you enter it, it means other people get pushed aside and have less of that room, and a lot of people feel smaller when that happens.<ep>
   ``So, if you're a room filler, are you supposed to feel guilty, or try to slink to the corner? No, you want to be what you can be. Do I know that I bug the living s--- out of some people? Sure, I know that. But I also know that my job isn't necessarily to make people feel good about me, or about themselves. It's just to make them feel.''<ep>
