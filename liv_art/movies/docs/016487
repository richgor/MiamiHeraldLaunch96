<m0>EW YORK (--) Ask any actor about director Jim Jarmusch, and you'll probably hear how he or she would love to work with him.<ep>
   Ask any young filmmaker about Jarmusch's movies, and you'll probably hear what a huge influence he's had.<ep>
   Ask your typical moviegoer about Jarmusch, and chances are you'll hear, ``Jim who?''<ep>
   In an age when the term ``cult favorite'' is so overused it's become meaningless, Jim Jarmusch is the real thing: Most people don't know him, but those in the know know him well. <ep>
   Beginning with <m0>Stranger Than Paradise, <m1> <m0>his 1984 comedy about aimlessness and ennui, <m1> <m0>Jarmusch's films have been embraced by a rabid following that covets his idle pacing, his seemingly spontaneous plotting and his deadpan humor.<ep>
   They've been imitated, too. You can see traces of Jarmusch in Richard Linklater's <m0>Slacker<m0>, Hal Hartley's <m0>The Unbelievable Truth<m0> and Kevin Smith's <m0>Clerks <m0>(--) movies made on shoestring <m1><styl>cxon<ql>

PLEASE SEE  JARMUSCH,  4I<qr>

<ql>
JARMUSCH,  FROM  1I<ql>
<ql>
<m0>budgets that are seemingly about nothing at all (Smith even thanks Jarmusch by name in the end credits of <m0>Clerks<m0>).<ep>
   Though none of his movies has broken through outside the arthouse circuit, Jarmusch's renown is such that he can pick his actors at will: The cast of his latest movie, <m0>Dead Man, <m0>which opens Friday, includes Johnny Depp, Robert Mitchum, John Hurt and Gabriel Byrne (--) some appearing only in tiny cameos that would normally be beneath their respected status.<ep>
   Jarmusch even <m0>looks <m0>the part of cult figure. Sitting in a poshly furnished suite in Midtown New York's Rihga Royal Hotel, chain-smoking and sipping tea, the director seems more than a bit out of place: Dressed completely in black, his trademark silver hair standing straight up, his voice an inflectionless rumble, he looks like he'd be much more comfortable sitting at a wobbly Formica table at a grungy Lower East Side coffeehouse, downing the house blend.<ep>
<m1>Staying aloof<ep>
<m0>   Jarmusch <m0>is<m0>, after all, the filmmaker of today's urban hipoisie. But don't dare call him that.<ep>
   ``People tend to want to categorize things and label them, measure them, when in fact they aren't measurable,'' Jarmusch says of his status on the coolness meter. ``I try to ignore it, because I don't know what it means. I've read things where people say, `He's made this black and white film, he dyes his hair white and wears black clothing to accentuate it.' Wow! Hey man, first of all I don't <m0>dye <m0>my hair, and second of all, I've worn black clothes since I was 15.<ep>
   ``These kind of things, I try not to pay attention. They're amusing, maybe, but foreign to me.''<ep>
   The labels have extended to his work, too. Jarmusch's follow-ups to <m0>Stranger Than Paradise <m0>(--) <m0>Down By Law, Mystery Train<m0>, <m0>Night On Earth <m0>(--) all expounded on <m0>Paradise'<m0>s minimalist aesthetic: They, too, consisted of static action where characters often speak in nonsequiturs and off-kilter behavior is ultimately more important than plot.<ep>
   Each successive movie, however, has been subtly more complex, in both technique and <m1>  <m0>theme. While every scene in <m0>Stranger Than Paradise <m0>consisted of a single long take separated by fade-outs, there was actual editing in <m0>Down By Law, <m0>the story of three mismatched headcases (played by Roberto Benigni, John Lurie and Tom Waits) making their escape from prison.<ep>
   In <m0>Mystery Train, <m0>Jarmusch used color and even moved his camera around for the first time. The movie's three loosely connected vignettes about Japanese tourists and the ghost of Elvis Presley formed a funky, surreal portrait of Memphis and American pop culture. <m0>Night on Earth <m0>was an exercise in irreverent synchronicity, depicting the adventures of five different taxi cab passengers around the world during a single night.<ep>
   The artistic progression led The New York Times' Vincent Canby to call Jarmusch ``the most adventurous and arresting filmmaker to surface in the American cinema in this decade.''<ep>
   Mighty strong praise (--) which, characteristically, Jarmusch doesn't take seriously.<ep>
   ``Pauline Kael [the New Yorker's former film critic] said that the characters in <m0>Stranger Than Paradise<m0> were `drugged on apathy.' I've been called cynical and nihilistic and existential, and a lot of things,'' he says. ``I don't object to it, because they are valid interpretations. I just try to ignore it, because I don't know what any of it means.''<ep>
<m1>Taking on Big Themes<m1><ep>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   <m0>Dead Man<m0> embodies many of the elements that have become his trademark: the deliberate pace, the deadpan humor, the shimmery black-and-white photography, the detours into sublimely ridiculous tangents.<ep>
   And, as in every film before it, Jarmusch takes it all further, though in this case to a much more dramatic degree. The movie is a darkly poetic fable that uses the western genre as a framework for a profound tale of destiny and spirituality. It's got some very funny moments, but it's not really a comedy.<ep>
   This time, Jarmusch is tackling Big Themes.<ep>
   At first, Jarmusch, 43, dismisses any talk of a change in artistic direction. ``I don't find it quite that big of a departure,'' he says. ``It <m0>is  <m0>different in that it's a period piece, and it makes reference to the `western' genre. But there are a lot of things about it that are very continuous with my other films: The rhythm, certain stylistic elements, the way the camera is used, a similar sense of humor. So I don't know if it's a shocking big difference.''<ep>
  Then, almost as an afterthought, he adds, ``But I'm not self-analytical, either, so . . . '' and leaves the statement hanging there, almost daring you to press on.<ep>
<m1>Getting below the surface<m1><ep>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   So you press on (--) and Jarmusch, who appears visibly uncomfortable discussing his work, grudgingly gives in.<ep>
  ``My other films are pretty much on the surface (--) what you see is what you get (--) which is a good thing about them and their sense of humor,'' he says. ``Life is an accumulation of a lot of things that are sad and funny and cruel and ugly and beautiful, and they all add up to your experience in the physical form. I try to make stories that don't focus <m0>only <m0>on the most dramatic moments of your life, because the really little, stupid things may be of equal importance.<ep>
  ``<m0>Dead Man<m0> has, at its center, a very simple story (--) it's still a simple kind of road movie (--) but there are a lot of implications. The film has peripheral themes like violence, America as a place, history, industrialization, the clash of cultures, poetry, fame, outlaw status, guns, genocide. There are a lot of things that are allowed to play around that little road movie that is the center. That was refreshing to me, to have a little more space to play with.''<ep>
  Having that extra space to play with costs money: <m0>Dead Man's <m0>budget of $9 million is paltry by Hollywood standards, but it's Jarmusch's biggest yet. Instead of turning to his frequent Hollywood suitors, the director financed the movie mainly through European and Japanese investors to ensure creative freedom. Most independent filmmakers yearn to become part of the studio system; Jarmusch is a steadfast outsider.<ep>
  ``I wouldn't be very good at making a film for someone else,'' Jarmusch explains. ``I'm just too stubborn. My films are very organic in the way they grow as a script, then change in the shooting, and then change again in the cutting. I don't think I would make a very good film with someone else telling me what the final cut should be, who should be cast, what editing changes to make.''<ep>
<m1>Scenes unfold<m1><ep>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   When writing a script, Jarmusch admits he doesn't consider his audience, either. ``I never think about what the audience would expect or prefer, only insomuch as I'm attempting to be a storyteller. Even if my films aren't really narrative-driven (--) they're more character-oriented (--) I'm still trying to tell a story, so I try to make the story interesting. But even while we make the film, those of us who are collaboratively making the film are making it for <m0>ourselves <m0>while we're making it.''<ep>
  Singer Iggy Pop, who plays a trapper dressed in drag in <m0>Dead Man<m0>, confirms Jarmusch's technique. ``Jim is very secretive,'' he says. ``He's a lot like Captain Ahab. He's a very strong presence, he takes a lot of risks, and he keeps everybody on their toes. He was careful not to give me a script until a few days before shooting, and then the scene wasn't even scripted at all. The script just said `Blake sees three trappers' and the only directions were who shoots who. We created it on the set, in about six hours.''<ep>
   What's most intriguing about <m0>Dead Man <m0>is that despite its marquee appeal, it's still Jarmusch's least accessible film to date. It's a work of dark beauty, peppered with moments of grim violence and transcendental spirituality. It's also Jarmusch's most mature and personal movie, proof that beneath the low-key, unfazable facade lies a passionate soul.<ep>
  ``With <m0>Dead Man<m0>, I think Jim took a huge next step, and it might be 25 years before people catch up with it,'' says John Pierson, author of <m0>Spike, Mike, Slackers & Dykes: A Guided Tour Across a Decade of Independent Cinema<m0>. ``At the L.A. Independent Film Festival, Jim introduced the movie by saying you have to watch it like you're on a drug trip. I think it helped. Time is going to treat <m0>Dead Man<m0> really well, but it's a big challenge in the current marketplace. It is obviously of no particular interest to whatever Johnny Depp's audience is.''<ep>
<m1>Lasting influence<m1><ep>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   In his book, Pierson champions <m0>Stranger Than Paradise<m0> (--) which Jarmusch made for $100,000 (--) as being the first of the modern wave of do-it-yourself independent cinema.<ep>
  ``<m0>Stranger Than Paradise'<m0>s<m0> <m0>influence on filmmakers around the country (--) Gus Van Sant, Gregg Araki, Allison Anders (--) was this sort of achievement that demonstrated empowerment,'' Pierson says. ``Jim was just another guy who went to NYU film school and made this movie with very limited resources. I think it's virtually a perfect film on its own terms, and he made it for no money. None of the other independent films that had been successful at around that time (--) <m0>Smithereens<m0>, <m1> <m0>El Norte<m0>, <m0>The Return of the Secaucus Seven<m0>, Paul Bartel's work (--) had such a powerful influence on everybody.''<ep>
   Predictably, however, Jarmusch feels uncomfortable with the idea of being the godfather of anyone's cinematic movement.<ep>
  ``I'm flattered by it, but at the same time I'm distrustful of it,'' Jarmusch says. ``That kind of filmmaking has always existed: It just gets more publicity now. But you can go back to the Nouvelle Vague [New Wave] in France, or New York at the same time with John Cassavetes making <m0>Shadows<m0> and Robert Frank making <m0>Pull My Daisy<m0>.''<ep>
  What Jarmusch <m0>will <m0>concede to is being a huge movie fan. And though he doesn't go to the movies as often as he used to (--) the last one he saw in a theater was <m0>Rumble in the Bronx<m0> (``I'm a big Jackie Chan fan'') (--) he remains cautiously upbeat about the state of American independent cinema.<ep>
  ``There are a lot of young people who are making stuff on their own, on small budgets,'' he says approvingly. ``But if you only try formulas and remakes, and treat films only as product, then it's really a bad, sad thing to the form. There's new blood coming in, so as long as they stick to their guns and make the films they want to make, I'll try to stay optimistic.''<ep>
