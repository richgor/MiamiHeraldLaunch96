   Mrs. Winterbourne,  now in theaters, is a rehash of last year's While You Were Sleeping  -- both are about a case of mistaken identity, with a poor woman embraced by a wealthy family.<P>

   Primal Fear  is a courtroom drama with a twist, a descendant of the classic Witness for the Prosecution,  and it features the kind of slippery-sleazy character Richard Gere has played his whole career.<P>

   We're talking about formulas, and while formula pictures aren't necessarily bad -- Mrs. Winterbourne  is dreadful, but Primal Fear  is good -- such formulas do make watching movies a predictable experience.<P>

   For example:<P>

    Why are bad guys in action movies always killed in order of wickedness -- first the henchmen, then the lieutenants and finally the mastermind?<P>

    Why do women in Woody Allen movies always tell him how great he is in bed?<P>

    Why do cops with a week left before retirement always have their worst week ever -- and then decide not to retire?<P>

   What follows are some standard plots of today's movies. These might not include everything, but they cover a lot of ground. <P>

   <LI> Dysfunctional Family Comes Together in the Course of Killing a Psycho: This is the plot of the new James Foley movie, Fear,  not to mention Cape Fear.  Psychos used to intrude on happy domesticity. Today they provide an opportunity for families to work out their issues.<P>

   <LI> Cop Protects a Woman and They Both Fall in Love (and Kill a Psycho): Except in Meg Ryan movies, the path of love these days is strewn with corpses -- as in The Bodyguard  or the Madeleine Stowe movies Blink  and Last of the Mohicans  (think about it).<P>

   <LI> Likable Black Racist Becomes Cuddly After Sharing Adventure With Likable White Guy: Samuel L. Jackson played in two of these -- with Nicolas Cage in Amos and Andrew  and, more recently, with Bruce Willis in Die Hard With a Vengeance.  Interestingly, the trend doesn't reverse: White racists in movies never become cuddly, and usually end up dead.<P>

   <LI> Evil Woman Destroys Sap: Stories about sexy, evil women pop up during times when sex is equated with danger -- like today, with Basic Instinct,  Body of Evidence,  Red Rock West  and The Last Seduction. <P>

   <LI> A Sly Opportunist Finds His Spiritual Center: This is Richard Gere's role (Power,  An Officer and a Gentleman ), but with some variations, this role was also played by Clark Gable. People like to believe those gorgeous hunks are deep-down good.<P>

   <LI> Dedicated Teacher's Moral Example Transforms Rotten Kids: This has been the story from Blackboard Jungle  through Dangerous Minds.  That's why it was refreshing to see Tom Berenger hedge his bets in The Substitute  by packing a .45.<P>

   <LI> Wife Throws Out Cheating Husband But Takes the Bum Back in the End: This has been such a standard plot, from the early '20s through Julia Roberts in Something to Talk About,  that when Jill Clayburgh refused to take Michael Murphy back in An Unmarried Woman,  it was hailed as a feminist statement. Curiously, the reverse plot is never filmed: When a husband throws a wife out for cheating, it never ends with him taking her back.<P>

   <LI> He Tries to Go Straight, But They Pull Him Back In: The reformed crook who gets pulled back into a life of crime is a movie staple, twice played by Al Pacino in the '90s (Carlito's Way,  Godfather III ) and by David Caruso last year in Kiss of Death. <P>

   <LI> Vampires: In the past year there have been four vampire movies: Dracula, Dead and Loving It,  From Dusk Till Dawn,  The Addiction  and Nadja.  The vampire is an all-purpose nightmare figure -- representing sex, spiritual death, conformity or anything else the film maker chooses.<P>

   <LI> Homespun (Sometimes Retarded) Fellow Finds His Way to the Center of Political Power by Mouthing Platitudes: Forrest Gump  is the egregious recent example. Also in this category are Being There  and Capra's populist films, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington  and Meet John Doe. <P>

   <LI> Underdog, Underclass Talent Shows He/She Has the Stuff: Like the above, this is the kind of fantasy democracies can't resist, with Rocky,  Flashdance  and -- yes -- Showgirls  being examples.<P>

   <LI> Tough Cop Almost Loses His Job After Harassing Well-Connected Criminal Kingpin No One Knows Is a Crook: Clint Eastwood is usually threatened with dismissal in his detective movies, sometimes because his immediate superior is on the take.<P>

<P>

   <LI> Oh No! Is Papa a Nazi? The answer is always yes, whether it's Father  with Max von Sydow, The Music Box  with Jessica Lange or the recent Getting Away With Murder  with Jack Lemmon. An innocent man hounded by sincere but mistaken Holocaust victims would be too controversial. Related are movies such as Shadow of a Doubt  (1943) and Suspicion  (1941), where a family member is suspected of murder.<P>

   <LI> Two Guys and a Gal: In three-way friendships, both men always end up having sex with the woman, whether it's Play It Again, Sam,  Jules and Jim,  Threesome  (with Lara Flynn Boyle) -- or the more chaste variant, The Philadelphia Story  (1940).<P>

   <LI> Happy-Go-Lucky Boy and Girl Drive Around and Kill People: Bonnie and Clyde  and Badlands  have given way to Kalifornia  and Natural Born Killers. <P>

   <LI> Obnoxious Men Congratulate Themselves for Their Immaturity and Talk About How Much They Adore Women: A modern trend: The Brothers McMullen,  Beautiful Girls  and the upcoming Palookaville. <P>

   <LI> Hate at First Sight Turns to Love: The oldest one in the book. Recent example: French Kiss,  with Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline.<P>
