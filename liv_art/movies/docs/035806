<m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>Celtic Pride <m0>(PG-13)<ep>
<m0>   <m0>Best for: <m0>teens who are fans of the Boston Celtics basketball team.<ep>
   <m0>Watch out for: <m0>lots of crude dialogue, disturbing slurs about the sexual orientation of Dan Aykroyd's character, a mother using offensive language in front of her son.<ep>
   <m0>What happens: <m0>The Celtics are close to winning the championship, and who better to cheer them on than a pair of rabid fans who happen to be best friends? When it looks like the Celtics will lose because of Utah Jazz player Lewis Scott (Damon Wayans), Mike (Daniel Stern) and Jimmy (Aykroyd) concoct a plan to kidnap Scott until the game is over. This movie clearly is aimed at young kids, but really isn't appropriate for them. If Disney had taken some pride in this, it would have been a funnier film suitable for younger audiences.<ql>

<ep>
<m0>   <m0>Jane Eyre <m0>(PG)<ep>
<m0>   <m0>Best for: <m0>mature teens (--) especially those who are literature lovers. Others may find the going far too slow.<ep>
   <m0>Watch out for: <m0>mild violence, adult issues (a suicide, infidelity, child abuse). Certain scenes make this inappropriate for younger kids (--) such as that of Jane's childhood friend dying after they both are humiliated by having their hair chopped off, Jane being rejected by her own family and ridiculed for her plain looks, and scenes of an insane woman trying to commit suicide.<ep>
   <m0>What happens: <m0>The story begins with young Jane (Anna Paquin) being raised and rejected by her cruel aunt (Fiona Shaw). Jane is sent to a girls' school, where she endures the harsh rule of the headmaster (John Wood) and his assistant (Geraldine Chaplin). When she grows up, Jane (now played by Charlotte Gainsbourg) takes a job as a governess at the estate of the wealthy and mysterious Rochester (William Hurt). The two fall in love, but a dark secret is revealed to prevent the marriage.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box)<m0> A Family Thing <m0>(PG-13) (--)<m0> Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones are a Southern bigot and his newly discovered black half-brother. Too much talk for most kids. Mature teens can learn from <m1> <m0>the message of tolerance. There's an abundance of adult issues (rape, racial prejudice, out-of-wedlock pregnancy, divorce) and dialogue that's blunt but effective.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>  <m0>(box) <m0>The Birdcage <m0>(R) (--) <m0>There's no explicit sex, but because of this movie's adult subject matter and language (--) one of the main characters owns a drag club in South Beach (--) this is best for older teens, who'll enjoy the silliness and maybe learn a thing or two about acceptance.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>Executive Decision <m0>(R) (--) <m0>Terrorist drama is filled with violence (--) several people are shot, a woman is hit by a terrorist and one man is sucked out of the airplane. But none of it is graphic. Might be OK for mature teens 13 and up.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>Fear<m0> (R) (--) <m0>With its high school protagonists and star Mark Wahlberg (formerly known as Marky Mark), teens may be drawn to this movie (--) but don't let them go. This is a perfect example of an R-rated movie that's made for kids under 17 but shouldn't be seen by them, except with an adult. Even with an adult, this film (--) with its abundance of abusive violence, explicit sex and intense life-and-death scenes (--) is not appropriate for kids.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>Flirting With Disaster <m0>(R)<m0> <m0>(--)<m0> For parents who think it's fine for teenagers to laugh at obnoxious moms and dads, drug use, adultery and comic sexual situations, this movie should provide plenty of dinner-table conversation.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box)<m0> Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco <m0>(G) (--) <m0>The brave pet trio is AWOL again, this time with dognappers after them. Except for a brief snarling skirmish, this is decent family entertainment, though the animals are continually in danger, which could be scary for kids under 5.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>James and the Giant Peach <m0>(PG)<m0> <m0>(--) <m0>This 80-minute film version of the Roald Dahl children's classic turns the fantastical voyage of a lonely orphan boy who escapes from two wicked aunts by going aloft in a large peach manned by insects into a wonderful collage of color, humor, innocence and life lessons. Its mix of three parts stop-motion animation and one part live action will mesmerize kids (especially those 6 to 13) (--) and adults. Some of the early live-action scenes (--) when James loses his parents to a giant rhinoceros and ends up being tortured by two scary aunts (--) may fuel younger kids' nightmares. But it's easy to tell better times are coming.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy <m0>(R) (--) <m0>The humor is aimed at the mind of an immature middle-school kid (--) though parents may balk at letting kids that young see this because of its<m0> <m0>constant profanity, occasional nudity, homoerotic film clips and simulated masturbation. Older teens will probably be bored (--) unless they think <m0>Beavis and Butt-head <m0>is too subtle.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>Mrs. Winterbourne<m0> <m0>(PG-13) (--) <m0>Teens should find plenty of chuckles in this uneven but enjoyable comedy about mistaken identity and love, starring Ricki Lake. The rating is for some profanity. Sophisticated kids 9-12 may enjoy the humor (though action buffs may get impatient). For younger kids, the initial train wreck will probably be upsetting, and they'll be confused.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>Muppet Treasure Island <m0>(G) (--) <m0>This musical adaptation, loosely based on the Robert Louis Stevenson classic, has some creepy-looking characters and slightly scary fight scenes, but they're punctured by comic relief. It's fine for kids as young as 5 and might even be OK for the intrepid 3- or 4-year-old.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>Oliver & Company <m0>(G)<m0> <m0>(--)<m0> This animated musical version of <m0>Oliver Twist <m0>portrays Oliver (voiced by Joey Lawrence) as an abandoned kitten and the Artful Dodger (Billy Joel) as a wily hound. The mangiest types, though, are humans. For sensitive 3- to 5-year-olds, this may be too scary. Kids 6 to 10 will love the action. Older kids will also find plenty to laugh at.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) <m0>Sgt. Bilko <m0>(PG) (--) <m0>The zaniness of Steve Martin's title character will very likely appeal to kids as young as 5, but his tongue-in-cheek humor may go over the heads of all but the most sophisticated of those younger kids. Best for kids 10 and up. Watch out for: a few mild expletives and a repetitious plot, which may bore the kids.<ql>
