<m0>HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT<ql>
<m1><styl>breakout,1<ql>
<m0>(star)(star)(star) <m0>An enthusiastically old-fashioned rumination on love, told from the female point of view. A young bride-to-be (Winona Ryder) spends a summer at her grandmother's house, where she meets a handsome suitor and starts having doubts about her upcoming marriage. She turns to her grandmother's friends for advice, and each tells a story about her own romance. Director Jocelyn Moorhouse (<m0>Proof<m0> ) embraces melodrama and weepy sentiment but never lets the movie dissolve into schmaltz (--) its tone is warm and gentle, and the huge cast turns in unselfish performances. <m0>(--)<m0> <m0>Rene Rodriguez<m0> (PG-13 vulgar language, sexual situations.) <m1> <m0>(1995, MCA/Universal, 117 minutes; available on video disc.)<ql>

<m0>WHITE MAN'S BURDEN<m2><ql>
<m0>(star)(star)<m0> John Travolta and Harry Belafonte star in this film set in a contemporary world where traditional race roles are reversed. It's a good gimmick (--) but that's all you get, a gimmick. <m0>(--) Rene Rodriguez <m0>(R; strong language, violence.) (1995, HBO, 89 minutes.)<ql>

<m0>MONEY TRAIN<m2><ql>
<m0>(star)(star)<m0> This disjointed mess will test the patience of even the most devout fans of Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson, whose chemistry made <m0>White Men Can't Jump  <m0>such a hoot. Here, the pair play foster brothers and New York cops who, by film's end, are aboard a runaway subway loaded with transit authority receipts, debating whether to steal the cash. Before then, however, the story derails across so many different story tracks, you begin to wonder if there was ever a script. <m0>(--) Rene Rodriguez<m0> (R; vulgar language, violence, sexual situations.)

<m0>TOM AND HUCK<m2><ql>
<m0>(star)(star)<m0> A literary classic is reduced to an after-school special in this movie starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas of <m0>Home Improvement  <m0>fame. Though touted as ``bad boys,'' this Tom and Huck could easily qualify for the church choir. Pretty bland, despite a murder and one foul-mouthed villain. <m0>(--) Christine Dolen <m0>(PG; vulgar language, violence.) (1995, Disney, $19.99, 92 minutes.)<ql>
