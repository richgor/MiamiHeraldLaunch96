<m0>  In <m0>The Substitute, <m0>Tom Berenger plays a hard-as-nails high school teacher who subscribes to the Rambo ethic of teaching. When his unruly students misbehave, he makes them write ``I'm sorry'' 100 times on the blackboard. If that doesn't work, he throws books or cans of soda at them. And if they're really bad, he breaks out the automatic weapons.<ep>
   Ludicrously conceived and laughably executed,<m0> The Substitute <m0>is a perverse action film about an out-of-work mercenary (Berenger) posing as a substitute teacher to avenge an attack on his teacher-girlfriend (Diane Venora).<ep>
   <ep>
   The movie was shot at the historic, gracefully arched Miami <m1> <m0>High School, which has been rechristened Columbus High and transformed into a hellish, graffiti-laden institution populated by every type of racial movie stereotype. The students pass through metal detectors and barbed-wire-topped fences to get to class. Fights frequently break out on the grounds, and teachers are afraid to walk to their cars after school.<ep>
   As their pistol-packing savior, Berenger is the mysterious ``Mr. Smith,'' a man with an ugly scar on one cheek and a laughable armory of tough-guy lines. During one of his first days at the blackboard, he growls, ``I am the warrior chief . . . Don't f--- with my universe.'' <ep>
   He soon identifies the school's toughest gang (--) the K.O.D. or Kings of Destruction (--) and uncovers an intricate web of drug smuggling and corruption that apparently ranges from downtown Miami to the Miccosukee Indian Village.<ep>
   The head of the K.O.D.'s drug ring is the principal, a smooth-talking, expensively dressed ex-cop (Ernie Hudson), who thinks nothing of unloading bags of cocaine in the school basement on parent-teacher night.<ep>
   Luckily, Mr. Smith knows how to handle these <m1> <m0>situations. He simply calls in his former mercenary pals, hauling a truckload of spy gadgets and heavy artillery. High school was never so, ahem, <m0>educational  <m0>(--) So, you say the dog ate your homework? <m0>Hasta la vista, <m0>baby.<ql>
