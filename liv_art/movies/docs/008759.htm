   Dead Man, director Jim Jarmusch's first movie in four years, is a western, but though it bears the trappings of the genre, it's unlike any western you've ever seen.<P>

      That was to be expected. But Dead Man is also different from any movie Jarmusch has ever made. All his trademarks are here: The laconic pace, the deadpan humor, the detours into sublimely ridiculous territory. But unlike in Jarmusch's previous work (Stranger Than Paradise, Mystery Train, Down By Law), there's a lot more to Dead Man than its minimalist aesthetic.<P>

   Set in the late 1800s, Dead Man tells of William Blake (Johnny Depp), a mild-mannered accountant who heads west to seek his fortune in the still-wild American frontier. Blake has been promised a job at a metal factory in the town of Machine, but shortly after arriving, he finds himself penniless and in despair. And what's worse, a nasty encounter with some townspeople leaves him mortally wounded with a bullet lodged near his heart. <P>

   Blake manages to flee Machine, and the movie takes a metaphysical turn as he is befriended by a Native American named Nobody (Gary Farmer) who mistakes Blake for the ghost of his namesake -- the Romantic poet William Blake -- and decides to guide him back to the world of the spirits.<P>

   Thus, Dead Man becomes a road movie -- one of Jarmusch's specialties -- but this time, it's a voyage of the soul. As he and Nobody cross the perilous wilderness, Blake finds himself pushed toward an identity far removed from his own, and the drama of the story comes in his initial resistance -- and gradual acceptance -- of his destiny.<P>

   Dead Man's cast is Jarmusch's richest to date. Depp, who excels at playing introverts, depicts Blake's self-discovery in a low-key, minutely detailed performance that anchors the movie in reality. As his guide, Farmer embodies both oddball humor and a rich wisdom that gives Nobody a larger-than-life aura.<P>

      Standouts in the large supporting cast include Lance Henriksen, who exudes pitch-black evil as the most ruthless killer on Blake's trail; Robert Mitchum as the blustery steel factory owner, who never meets with an employee without shotgun in hand; and Crispin Glover as an exceedingly odd train passenger who advises Blake: ``I wouldn't trust no words written down on no piece of paper.'' <P>

   As it turns out, he was right. Dead Man is about seeing past the physical to reach what's truly important, a dreamlike fable that uses the western genre as a framework for a much more profound, thematically complex tale of destiny and spirituality.<P>

    It's beautiful, understated and measured, and it's the weirdest thing Jarmusch has done. Who would have guessed he had it in him?<BR>
