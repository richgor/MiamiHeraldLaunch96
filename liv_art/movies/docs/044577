  <m0>Twister<m0> is a giant monster movie (--) Godzilla in the Midwest, or King Kong Goes to the Heartland (--) except that the monster in this one is Mother Nature, and she's in a <m0>really bad <m0>mood.<ep>
  As far as special effects go, it's state-of-the-art neat. The movie, which reportedly cost $80 million to make, delivers a whirlwind of jaw-dropping sights, including the coolest flying cow you're likely to see. By bringing you up close and personal with the fury of a gigantic tornado, <m0>Twister<m0> lets you glimpse things most people will never get to see (--) or at least live to discuss.<ep>
     But for all its awesome wonder, <m0>Twister<m0> blows. The movie's plot (--) all about two competing groups of storm chasers who perilously follow tornadoes around the Midwest for scientific analysis (--) is silly, kindergarten-level stuff.<ep>
   The good guys, a ragtag team led by soon-to-be-divorcees Jo (Helen Hunt) and Bill (Bill Paxton), drive around in scrappy pickups and colorfully decorated vans blaring rock and roll from speakers mounted atop their cars.<ep>
<m0>Simple, dumb plot<ep>
   <m0><ep>
  The bad guys, led by the smarmy Jonas (Cary Elwes), command an army of sleek black minivans equipped with high-tech gear, and they sneer at every opportunity. The difference between the two groups is that the good guys are in it for the science, and the bad guys are in it for the money. It's that simple, and that dumb.<ep>
 Screenwriters Michael Crichton (<m0>Jurassic Park, Congo<m0>) and wife Anne-Marie Martin have done a shockingly bad job of giving these thrill-seeking eggheads any personality. The writing is as lazy as the special effects are ground-breaking, and though Hunt and Paxton are likable actors who acquit themselves admirably in scenes of physical derring-do, neither has enough charisma to overcome such lines as ``So, Jo, about those divorce papers . . .''<ep>
  The movie is also cluttered with extraneous supporting characters. At first, you figure some of them are there to serve as sacrificial fodder for the elements' wrath. Eventually, though, you realize they've been thrown in merely to help pad the running time. By refusing to kill off almost any of their characters, the filmmakers miss a big opportunity to make the tornadoes more fearsome (--) and give the movie's suspense a deadly edge.<ep>
<m0>Thrill ride<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Still, there are the storms, which get bigger and meaner as the story progresses. Director Jan De Bont (<m0>Speed<m0>) pulls off some spectacular setpieces: A tornado that strikes a packed drive-in showing <m0>The Shining<m0>, a pair of smaller tornadoes that perform a deadly tango over a river, and the climactic monster storm are all so impressive, they leave you wishing you could watch the movie on an IMAX-size screen. In its best moments, as winds send telephone poles, gasoline tankers and entire houses flying, <m0>Twister<m0> makes for an enjoyable thrill ride.<ep>
  The problem is that even the most intense tornado is brief, so the big moments always seem to end just as you're beginning to enjoy them. And whenever the skies clear, <m0>Twister<m0> has nothing to focus on but its dull heroes, and the movie becomes as dry as a meteorology textbook. By the end, you'll be rooting for the storm to whisk all these characters away (--) like the pieces of cardboard that they are.<ql>
