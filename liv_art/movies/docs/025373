   The popularity of Walt Disney animation is at an all-time high, which makes it a perfect time for <m0>Frank & Ollie<m0>, a documentary about two of Disney's original animating team (or the ``Nine Old Men,'' as Walt himself affectionately called them).<ep>
   The movie tells the story of Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, who first went to work at the Disney studios in the 1930s. Throughout their long careers, the pair worked on some of the company's most beloved classics, including <m0>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Bambi, Lady and the Tramp, The Jungle Book<m0> and <m0>Robin Hood<m0>. Hearing the pair talk about making these films is fascinating, particularly since many of them were such groundbreaking efforts in their time (--) and many have never been equaled.<ep>
   Most people think of animators as skilled artists, but <m0>Frank & Ollie<m0> reveals that the best in the craft were also terrific actors: The only way to get a sketch to take on a personality that transcends paper and ink is to imbue it with some of your own, and Thomas and Johnston show how much of themselves went into each of their cartoon characters. The men's memories remain razor-sharp, and their anecdotes provide a stimulating (--) and often very funny (--) glimpse into the creative process.<ep>
   <m0>Frank & Ollie<m0> also traces the lifelong friendship between these two men, who became best buddies in college, moved into neighboring houses after marrying their respective wives, and today remain inseparable. Watching them complete each other's sentences and thoughts, you get to watch two artistic minds working in perfect unison, and the effect is as amazing as anything in the Disney vaults. <m0>Frank & Ollie<m0> is a treat for any animation lover, but it's equally rewarding to anyone interested in plain old human beings.<ql>
