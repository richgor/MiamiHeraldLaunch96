<P>

  Mulholland Falls is about the abuse of power -- specifically the abuse of authority -- and the question of whether crimes committed for ``the common good'' are beyond reproach, and whether such power can really exist without inevitably corrupting those who wield it.<P>

   Lofty themes, these -- and Mulholland Falls initially seems primed to tackle them in a serious way. The movie comes on like gangbusters, with a cast overcrowded with big names and a director -- New Zealand's Lee Tamahori -- eager to make his big-time Hollywood debut a notable one.<P>

   But when Mulholland Falls should reverberate with complexity, it simply echoes other movies. It's a glossy tribute to film noir, not a memorable entry in the genre. It's too simple-minded, yet it leaves a heap of questions unanswered.<P>

   Set in a gorgeously re-created 1950s Los Angeles, the movie centers on the Hat Squad, a team of four hardboiled detectives with impeccable taste in clothes and immunity from typical police protocol. For these guys, there are no politics, no favors, certainly no Miranda rights. When they pick you up for questioning, chances are you'll wind up in a hospital -- or worse.<P>

   That immunity is tested when an investigation into the murder of a beautiful woman (Jennifer Connelly) points to Gen. Thomas Timms (a terrific John Malkovich), head of the Atomic Energy Commission, a man even more above the law than the Hat Squad. Timms' high military ranking doesn't faze the cops, but soon the FBI is leaning on them to back off -- and the feds are not just asking politely, either.<P>

   On a technical level, Mulholland Falls is pretty much flawless. It's clear that Tamahori, who made a formidable debut last year with the shattering Once Were Warriors, belongs in Hollywood: His movie is sleek and sumptuous, vibrantly directed with a careful eye for detail.<P>

   Tamahori enlisted a dream crew, too: renowned cinematographer Haskell Wexler, who can work miracles with light; costume designer Ellen Mirojnick, who outfitted the Squad with their impossibly cool threads; and editor Sally Menke (Pulp Fiction), who adds crispness and punch to Tamahori's mayhem (like he did in Once Were Warriors, Tamahori brings brutish realism to his scenes of violence; the fights here are quick and nasty, and feel uncomfortably real).<P>

   The sprawling cast is fine, too, headed by Nick Nolte as the grizzled Hat Squad leader, whose Achilles' heel is an infidelity that threatens his marriage. As his wife, Melanie Griffith delivers a refreshingly understated performance that forms the movie's emotional center. She's surprisingly good.<P>

  Nolte's gang is rounded out by Chazz Palminteri, Michael Madsen and Chris Penn, and the four work up a sweetly touching camaraderie at humorous odds with their unpleasant line of work. It's a telling sign of the respect Tamahori already commands that tiny roles are filled with well-known actors -- though some casting choices, like no-talent Andrew McCarthy as a whiny, effeminate informant, are puzzling.<P>

   Tamahori is an avowed fan of American noirs, and he gets the surface right: It's neat just watching the Hat Squad zip around in their 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible, or dangle cigarettes just so from under wide-brimmed hats slung low on their foreheads (there is so much smoking in this movie, you expect to see a surgeon general's warning among the end credits).<P>

  But as the mystery unravels, you realize the story isn't going to live up to the atmosphere, and disappointment creeps in. Mulholland Falls flirts with epic themes, then settles for convention: It's a small, corny B-flick dressed up in grade-A duds.<BR>
