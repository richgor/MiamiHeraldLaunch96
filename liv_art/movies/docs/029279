<m0>   Call it the Curse of the Costume, but cinematic history tells us that whenever an actress dons movie action-wear, her career is placed in jeopardy larger than any faced in the movie that requires it.<ep>
   It's conceivable that <m0>Barb Wire<m0>'s Pamela Anderson Lee is already such an icon that nothing can stop her march to world domination. And Jane Fonda eventually rebounded from the bust of <m0>Barbarella<m0>, if you'll excuse the expression. But all too often, the fate of the breastplated or spandex-wrapped heroine is, as they tend to say in movies like these, worse than death. Consider:<ep>
   (box) Helen Slater (--) Blond, beautiful Slater was considered a major discovery when she won the coveted role of <m0>Supergirl<m0> in 1984. But the film stopped her ascent to stardom like Kryptonite.<ep>
   (box) Tanya Roberts (--) Having kicked behinds and taken names on television's <m0>Charlie's Angels<m0>, she was considered the perfect choice to wear the loincloth in 1984's <m0>Sheena<m0>, based on the pulp and comic exploits of the Queen of the Jungle. Instead, she was lost in the jungle.<ep>
   (box) Sandahl Bergman (--) The muscular, seductive Bergman made a big impression in <m0>All That Jazz<m0>, but as the pulp fiction female barbarian in 1985's <m0>Red Sonja<m0>, she drew no blood.<ep>
   (box) Lori Ann Petty (--) Petty was coming along nicely as a character actress, thanks, then she got in the postpunk gear of the comic's hot-tempered <m0>Tank Girl<m0>. It, and Petty, tanked.<ep>
