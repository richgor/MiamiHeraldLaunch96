  The O.J. Simpson trial is going to figure in a feature film based on prosecutor Christopher Darden's bestseller In Contempt. You certainly have to give the movie's producers credit. After all, a screenwriter would be laughed out of his pitch conference if he suggested making a movie about a lawyer that ends with him losing the case. But unless the makers of In Contempt are going to go the ``loosely based on'' route, it's hard to see how they're going to get around that verdict.<P>

Say cheese, South Florida<P>

<P>

 The faces -- and facades -- will be familiar when prizes are handed out next week at the Louis Wolfson II Media History Center's eighth annual film and video awards ceremony. That's because the awards honor documentary, news and artistic projects that are about Florida or were produced here, or at least incorporate archival images of the state.<P>

 You can attend the ceremony at 7:15 p.m. Thursday at the Colony Theatre, 1040 Lincoln Rd., Miami Beach. (Admission is free, but you'll need to RSVP; call (305) 375-1505. There's also a reception at 6 p.m. for $35.)<P>

   WTVJ-Channel 6 anchor Tony Segreto will preside.<P>

Even more dirty dancing<P>

   A sequel to the Patrick Swayze swoon-fest, Dirty Dancing, could finally make it onto the big screen.<P>

   Live Entertainment has offered $5 million to Swayze to reprise his role as hunky dance instructor, Johnny Castle. The original 1987 film was an undisputable hit, grossing $65 million domestically. There's no word on what the script would be like. Swayze has not yet accepted any offers, and reps say he would only do so if granted director and script approval. <P>

Chinese love `Bridges' <P>

   Chinese moviegoers are weeping in the aisles over The Bridges of Madison County, the Iowa romance starring Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep. A survey of Beijing audiences found that 47.6 percent shed a tear during the film, which has set box office records in that country.  Science Theater signing off<P>

   Their movie is just now hitting theaters (review, 6G), so why is the captive crew of the Satellite of Love bidding a fond farewell to TV audiences? At 5 p.m. May 18, Comedy Central will air its final original episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. <P>

   Comedy Central and the producers of MST3K, Best Brains Inc., were reportedly unable to reach an agreement over contact renewals, but the cable channel says it will continue to air reruns of MST3K through 1996. <P>

   The closing show is a spoof of Stanley Kubrick's love-it-or-hate-it sci-fi opus 2001: A Space Odyssey in which Mike, Crow and Tom Servo reach the end of the universe and encounter an old man, a monolith and a baby.<P>

  Elsewhere in the galaxy, Joel Hodgson, the show's sleepy-eyed creator, will debut his comedy sketch show, The TV Wheel, at 7 p.m. May 18 on Comedy Central.
