   Hard to believe that a TV show starring a couple of cheaply constructed robot puppets, a corn-fed, Midwestern host and some of the schlockiest sci-fi movies in history has grown from Minnesota obscurity to big screen hilarity.<ep>
   We're talking about <m0>Mystery Science Theater 3000, <m0>the Comedy Central cable TV show whose wisecracking jabberboxes make lemonade out of otherwise unwatchable lemons such as <m0>The Brain That Wouldn't Die, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians <m0>and<m0> Hercules and the Captive Women.<m0><ep>
   Boosted by an intensely loyal fan base, the show has spawned <m0>Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie<m0>, a delirious romp in which affable host Mike Nelson and his robot sidekicks, Tom Servo (voice of Kevin Murphy) and Crow (Trace Beaulieu), lob<m0> <m0>sarcastic zingers at a defenseless 1954 bomb called <m0>This Island Earth.<m0><ep>
   On the surface, this paranoid, McCarthy-era gem appears to have all the earmark qualities of an <m0>MST3K<m0> candidate: It stars the booming-voiced Rex Reason as a suited, ultra-serious hunk who must defend his busty sidekick, Ruth, and the planet from a takeover by white-haired aliens with protruding foreheads, deep tans and polyester jumpsuits. <m0>Quel fromage!<m0><ep>
   Before the action has even started, the robot crew is cutting up the opening credits: ``Ted Turner's colorizing the universe!'' Servo shrieks in mock horror as one of several onscreen constellations turns from white to red.<ep>
   But <m0>Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie<m0> is unable to maintain that buoyant humor for the duration. <m0>This Island Earth, <m0>after all, is a plodding movie, and not even the wittiest jibes can hurry it along. An hour into the film, viewers will be fighting the couch-potato urge to change channels.<ep>
   Which is probably why the movie version of <m0>MST3K <m0>is only a breezy 74 minutes, interrupted occasionally by the oddball, cockpit sketches fans have come to expect from the TV show. There is no greater significance to these skits than the ones you can see in reruns on Comedy Central.<ep>
   Still, for diehard MiSTies, these shortcomings won't matter. The lure of trashy cinema will prevail along with the strangely gratifying thrill of hearing the traditionally G-rated 'bots indulge in racier, foul-mouthed comments. Moviedom does have its perks.<ep>
