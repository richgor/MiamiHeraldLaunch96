By RENE RODRIGUEZ<BR>

   This review first appeared in February when the movie played at the Miami Film Festival.<P>

<P>

      The six friends in Denise Calls Up are just too busy to actually spend any time with each other. So they keep in touch -- constant touch -- by telephone. Every line of dialogue in Denise Calls Up is spoken into a phone, and almost every scene consists of a character holding receiver to ear -- or, occasionally, some other body part. At its most basic, the movie is a series of monologues intercut into each other.<P>

    No, it doesn't sound like it should work very well. But writer-director Hal Salwen pulls it off, beautifully: Just when you think Denise Calls Up has wrung the last bit of novelty out of its premise, Salwen throws in another inventive wrinkle, and then another, and before you know it, the movie's characters have experienced everything from first-date jitters to breaking up, from sex to childbirth . . . even death. <P>

   Denise (Alanna Ubach) is pregnant from Martin, who donated sperm and then forgot all about it. Martin (Dan Gunther) is still reeling from this revelation while advising his friend Jerry (Liev Schreiber) on his upcoming blind date with Barbara. Barbara (Caroleen Feeney) hasn't dated for so long, she tells her friend Gale she's not sure she can go through with the date. Gale (Dana Wheeler Nicholson), whose last sexual experience was with the refrigerator repairman, longs to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Frank (Tim Daly). But Frank is up to his neck in work. Like everyone else, he's overwhelmed, drowning, besieged -- and he's grown so used to relating to his friends by telephone, he sees no need to actually hang out with any of them. <P>

      Salwen's satire about our overdependence on technology (the characters are constantly interacting with some sort of machine) is sly and endearing, but Denise Calls Up works as a real movie, too: This might be the first true comedy about call waiting, but it's the humans in it that make it special.<BR>
