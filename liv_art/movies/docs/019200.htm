  Carl, we knew you when. Striptease hasn't even hit theaters yet (it's scheduled to open nationwide on June 28), but South Florida novelist Carl Hiaasen has already become a darling of movie producers. Variety reports that Hiaasen's next book became the subject of a fierce bidding war between some of Hollywood's biggest players, including Mel Gibson's Icon Productions, Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks SKG, the Walt Disney Co. and 20th Century Fox.<P>

  The winner? Producer Bob Jaffe, who purchased an option to the novel for Sony Entertainment for ``a high six-figure sum.'' That figure will climb to $1 million when the movie goes into production. The novel, which isn't finished yet and doesn't even have a title, is about a woman who wins the Florida Lottery, then runs afoul of two other winners who steal her ticket so they can keep the whole pot.<P>

  Laconic rocker Tom Petty is joining Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton and Neil Young in the field of movie soundtracks. Petty will provide the score for She's the One, the upcoming comedy from The Brothers McMullen director Ed Burns, starring Cameron Diaz and Friends' Jennifer Aniston. Petty will write and perform six songs for the film, due in theaters this summer.<P>

Alfre Woodard and Babe's James Cromwell on the bridge of the new U.S.S. Enterprise later this year. The two have joined the cast of the eighth of the big-screen Star Trek adventures, currently filming now. Cromwell will play the inventor of the warp drive that powers the Starfleet's spaceships and Woodard will play a civilian accompanying Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart) on a mission to save our planet from the evil Borg. The movie, directed by cast member Jonathan Frakes, is scheduled for release this Thanksgiving.<P>

Robert Redford might be getting some high-powered co-stars in the movie adaptation of The Horse Whisperer. Variety reports Emma Thompson and Natalie Portman (Beautiful Girls) are set to appear in the film alongside Redford. The movie is based on Nicholas Evans' bestselling novel about the romance between the mother of a girl injured in a horseback accident and a man with a supernatural ability in handling horses.<P>
