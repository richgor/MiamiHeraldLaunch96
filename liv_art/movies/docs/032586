  <m0>The Truth About Cats & Dogs<m0> is a radio talk show hosted by veterinarian Abby Barnes (Janeane Garofalo), who doles out advice to animal owners over the airwaves (``You can love your pet, but you shouldn't <m0>loooove <m0>your pet.'') When Brian (Ben Chaplin), a photographer confronted by a growling great Dane in roller skates, calls the show for help, Abby talks him through the delicate procedure of getting the dog off the wheels.<ep>
  Brian is so grateful (--) and so taken by Abby's gently deprecating wit (--) that he asks her out on a date. Abby, who's tired of spending her nights at home alone with her cat, excitedly agrees (--) until Brian asks her what she looks like.<ep>
  ``I'm 5-10, blond, thin, hard to miss,'' she replies, describing everything she's not (--) and everything her neighbor, model Noelle (Uma Thurman), is.<ep>
   <m0>The Truth About Cats & Dogs<m0> is a comedy for anyone who has ever liked someone from afar and thought, ``I could get that person to fall in love with me, if<m0> <m0>I only had the chance.'' It's a warm-hearted look at how insecurity can interfere with romantic longing: Abby's self-esteem is too shaky to allow her to actually meet Brian; she figures he wouldn't look at her twice.<ep>
  So she convinces the statuesque Noelle to impersonate her. Naturally, Brian goes ga-ga over the blond beauty, but he can't figure out what happened to Abby's personality (Noelle isn't quite a dumb blond, but her bulb is considerably dimmer than Abby's).<ep>
  What's worse, Noelle initially plays along for the sake of her friend, but the more she gets to know Brian, the more she grows to like him (--) resulting in a delightfully unusual love triangle.<ep>
  <m0>The Truth About Cats & Dogs <m0>gives Garofalo (<m0>Reality Bites, Bye Bye Love, <m0>television's <m0>The Larry Sanders Show) <m0>her first leading role, and her caustic, cynical brand of humor is still evident (particularly in the scenes where she fields calls from her radio show listeners).<ep>
  But Abby is also something of a departure for Garofalo: The character is a tender-hearted soul who desperately craves a relationship, and Garofalo captures Abby's pain and longing without evoking maudlin self-pity. She's nobody's victim, and it's hard not to fall in love with her as she tentatively begins to climb out of her repressed shell.<ep>
  Thurman, who looks gigantic next to Garofalo (the movie makes sly comic use of their disparate heights), makes Noelle an equally vulnerable beauty: She genuinely seems unaware of how gorgeous she is, even though men constantly act like fools in her presence, and Thurman delivers a subtly effective performance that meshes perfectly with Garofalo's. They make a great team, these two, and <m0>The Truth About Cats & Dogs<m0> makes for a great date movie.<ql>
