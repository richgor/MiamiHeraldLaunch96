<m0>   If documentaries won awards for costume design, the prize (--) hands down (--) would go to Beth Solberg's <m0>Bananas Is My Business.<m0><ep>
   That's because her subject is Carmen Miranda, the so-called Brazilian Bombshell, whose fruit-salad headgear, outsized earrings and Technicolor wardrobe helped transform her into a popular singer, movie star <m1> <m0>and, finally, a caricature of herself.<ep>
   <m0> <m0>Bananas<m0>, which aired on PBS in October, traces the career of the woman who would become the personification of Latin spirit and Latina stereotypes.<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The film <m1> <m0>explores the ambivalence audiences felt toward the pop idol, who (--) once in New York (--) was considered too American for Brazilian fans yet too Brazilian to be taken seriously in America.<ep>
   In 1943, Miranda was the highest-paid performer in America. But by the time of her death in 1955, Miranda was 46 and had struggled with pills, alcohol, an abusive marriage and, most of all, overwhelming disappointment at the direction her career had taken.<ep>
    The Brazilian-born Solberg sees Miranda as a woman caught between two cultures, and her film is a personal statement. Yet personalized scenes in which Erick Baretto (in drag) portrays Carmen against Solberg's narration, are the weakest part of the film. They aren't compelling, and juxtaposed with footage of the real thing, you can clearly see that bananas was Carmen's business (--) and nobody else's.<ql>
