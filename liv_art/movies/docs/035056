<m0>ALL THAT CHAZZ<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   When Chazz Palminteri steps out of the sleek Buick Roadmaster that serves as transportation for the stylish rogue cops of <m0>Mulholland Falls,<m0> he will find himself in contention for the all-time screen saturation record.<ep>
   Palminteri can be seen in two other current movies, playing Sharon's Stone's sadistic lover in <m0>Diabolique <m0>and the hitman hired to take out Cher in <m0>Faithful.<m0><ep>
   So, is Palminteri the new Michael Caine, distinguished by his very ubiquity?<ep>
   ``Ahh, I knew somebody was going to say that,'' says Palminteri, expelling a large sigh into the telephone.<ep>
   ``What can I tell ya? I like to work,'' he says, sounding almost as weary as Moses looking into the valley. He must mean acting, not interviewing, but there is a reason Palminteri has come out of nowhere to become one of the sought-after character actors in film.<ep>
   ``Well, it's Hollywood, you know,'' says Palminteri. ``In this town, they tend to send you things they immediately think of you for, which means that I get a lot of cops and heavies. But I don't mind that if they're something more than that. What you're really looking for is something three-dimensional, something you can really act.''<ep>
