   <m0>Dead Man<m0>, director Jim Jarmusch's first movie in four years, is a western, but though it bears the trappings of the genre, it's unlike any western you've ever seen.<ep>
      That was to be expected. But <m0>Dead Man<m0> is also different from any movie Jarmusch has ever made. <m1> <m0>All his <m1> <m0>trademarks are <m1> <m0>here: The laconic pace, the deadpan humor, the detours into sublimely ridiculous territory. But unlike in Jarmusch's previous work (<m0>Stranger Than Paradise, Mystery Train, Down By Law<m0>), there's a lot more to <m0>Dead Man<m0> than its minimalist aesthetic.<ep>
   Set in the late 1800s, <m0>Dead Man<m0> tells of William Blake (Johnny Depp), a mild-mannered accountant who heads west to seek his fortune in the still-wild American frontier. Blake has been promised a job at a metal factory in the town of Machine, but shortly after arriving, he finds himself penniless and in despair. And what's worse, a nasty encounter with some townspeople leaves him <m1> <m0>mortally wounded with a bullet lodged near his heart. <ep>
   Blake manages to flee Machine, and the movie takes a metaphysical turn as he is befriended by a Native American named Nobody (Gary Farmer) who <m1> <m0>mistakes Blake for the ghost of his namesake (--) the Romantic poet William Blake (--) and decides to guide him back to the world of the spirits.<ep>
   Thus, <m0>Dead Man<m0> becomes a road movie (--) one of Jarmusch's specialties (--) but this time, it's a voyage of the soul. As he and Nobody cross the perilous wilderness, <m1> <m0>Blake finds himself <m1> <m0>pushed toward an identity far removed from his own, and the drama of the story comes in his initial resistance (--) and gradual acceptance (--) of his destiny.<ep>
<m0>   Dead Man<m0>'s cast is Jarmusch's richest to date. Depp, who excels at playing introverts, depicts Blake's self-discovery in a low-key, minutely detailed performance that anchors the movie in reality. As his guide, Farmer embodies both oddball humor and a rich wisdom that gives Nobody a larger-than-life aura.<ep>
      Standouts in the large supporting cast include Lance Henriksen, who exudes pitch-black evil as the most ruthless killer on Blake's trail; Robert Mitchum as the blustery steel factory owner, who never meets with an employee without shotgun in hand; and Crispin Glover as an exceedingly odd train passenger who advises Blake: ``I wouldn't trust no words written down on no piece of paper.'' <ep>
   As it turns out, he was right. <m0>Dead Man<m0> is about seeing past the physical to reach what's truly important, a dreamlike fable that uses the western genre as a framework for a much more profound, thematically complex tale of destiny and spirituality.<ep>
    It's beautiful, understated and measured, and it's the weirdest thing Jarmusch has done. Who would have guessed he had it in him?<ql>
