By RENE RODRIGUEZ<BR>
Herald Movie Critic<P>

  The Truth About Cats & Dogs is a radio talk show hosted by veterinarian Abby Barnes (Janeane Garofalo), who doles out advice to animal owners over the airwaves (``You can love your pet, but you shouldn't loooove your pet.'') When Brian (Ben Chaplin), a photographer confronted by a growling great Dane in roller skates, calls the show for help, Abby talks him through the delicate procedure of getting the dog off the wheels.<P>

  Brian is so grateful -- and so taken by Abby's gently deprecating wit -- that he asks her out on a date. Abby, who's tired of spending her nights at home alone with her cat, excitedly agrees -- until Brian asks her what she looks like.<P>

  ``I'm 5-10, blond, thin, hard to miss,'' she replies, describing everything she's not -- and everything her neighbor, model Noelle (Uma Thurman), is.<P>

   The Truth About Cats & Dogs is a comedy for anyone who has ever liked someone from afar and thought, ``I could get that person to fall in love with me, if I only had the chance.'' It's a warm-hearted look at how insecurity can interfere with romantic longing: Abby's self-esteem is too shaky to allow her to actually meet Brian; she figures he wouldn't look at her twice.<P>

  So she convinces the statuesque Noelle to impersonate her. Naturally, Brian goes ga-ga over the blond beauty, but he can't figure out what happened to Abby's personality (Noelle isn't quite a dumb blond, but her bulb is considerably dimmer than Abby's).<P>

  What's worse, Noelle initially plays along for the sake of her friend, but the more she gets to know Brian, the more she grows to like him -- resulting in a delightfully unusual love triangle.<P>

  The Truth About Cats & Dogs gives Garofalo (Reality Bites, Bye Bye Love, television's The Larry Sanders Show) her first leading role, and her caustic, cynical brand of humor is still evident (particularly in the scenes where she fields calls from her radio show listeners).<P>

  But Abby is also something of a departure for Garofalo: The character is a tender-hearted soul who desperately craves a relationship, and Garofalo captures Abby's pain and longing without evoking maudlin self-pity. She's nobody's victim, and it's hard not to fall in love with her as she tentatively begins to climb out of her repressed shell.<P>

  Thurman, who looks gigantic next to Garofalo (the movie makes sly comic use of their disparate heights), makes Noelle an equally vulnerable beauty: She genuinely seems unaware of how gorgeous she is, even though men constantly act like fools in her presence, and Thurman delivers a subtly effective performance that meshes perfectly with Garofalo's. They make a great team, these two, and The Truth About Cats & Dogs makes for a great date movie.<BR>
