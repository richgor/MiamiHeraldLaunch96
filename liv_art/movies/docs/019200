<m0>  Carl, we knew you when. <m0>Striptease<m0> hasn't even hit theaters yet (it's <m1> <m0>scheduled to open nationwide on June 28), but South Florida novelist <m0>Carl Hiaasen<m0> has already become a darling of movie producers. Variety reports that Hiaasen's next book became the subject of a fierce bidding war between some of Hollywood's biggest players, including <m0>Mel Gibson's <m0>Icon Productions, <m0>Steven Spielberg's <m0>Dreamworks SKG, the Walt Disney Co. and 20th Century Fox.<ep>
  The winner? Producer <m0>Bob Jaffe<m0>, who purchased an option to the novel for Sony Entertainment for ``a high six-figure sum.'' That figure will climb to $1 million when the movie goes into production. The novel, which isn't finished yet and doesn't even have a title, is about a woman who wins the Florida Lottery, then runs afoul of two other winners who steal her ticket so they can keep the whole pot.<ep>
<m1>Soundtrack by Petty<ep>
<m0>  Laconic rocker <m0>Tom Petty<m0> is joining <m0>Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton <m0>and<m0> Neil Young <m0>in the field of movie soundtracks. Petty will provide the score for <m0>She's the One<m0>, the upcoming comedy from <m0>The Brothers McMullen<m0> director <m0>Ed Burns,<m0> starring <m0>Cameron Diaz <m0>and <m0>Friends'<m0> <m0>Jennifer Aniston<m0>. Petty will write and perform six songs for the film, due in theaters this summer.<ep>
<m1>`Star Trek' VIII<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Look for <m0>Alfre Woodard <m0>and <m0>Babe<m0>'s <m0>James Cromwell<m0> on the bridge of the new U.S.S. Enterprise later this year. The two have joined the cast of the eighth of the big-screen <m0>Star Trek<m0> adventures, currently filming now. Cromwell will play the inventor of the warp drive that powers the Starfleet's spaceships and Woodard will play a civilian accompanying Capt. Picard (<m0>Patrick Stewart<m0>) on a mission to save our planet from the evil Borg. The movie, directed by cast member <m0>Jonathan Frakes<m0>, is scheduled for release this Thanksgiving.<ep>
<m1>Saddling up<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  <m0>Robert Redford<m0> might be getting some high-powered co-stars in the movie adaptation of <m0>The Horse Whisperer<m0>. Variety reports <m0>Emma Thompson <m0>and <m0>Natalie Portman<m0> (<m0>Beautiful Girls<m0>) are set to appear in the film alongside Redford. The movie is based on <m0>Nicholas Evans<m0>' bestselling novel about the romance between the mother of a girl injured in a horseback accident and a man with a supernatural ability in handling horses.<ep>
