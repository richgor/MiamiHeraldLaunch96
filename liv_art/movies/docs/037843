<m0>   <m0>Mrs. Winterbourne,<m0>  now in theaters, is a rehash of last year's <m0>While You Were Sleeping<m0>  (--) both are about a case of mistaken identity, with a poor woman embraced by a wealthy family.<ep>
   <m0>Primal Fear<m0>  is a courtroom drama with a twist, a descendant of the classic <m0>Witness for the Prosecution,<m0>  and it features the kind of slippery-sleazy character Richard Gere has played his whole career.<ep>
   We're talking about formulas, and while formula pictures aren't necessarily bad (--) <m0>Mrs. Winterbourne<m0>  is dreadful, but <m0>Primal Fear<m0>  is good (--) such formulas do make watching movies a predictable experience.<ep>
   For example:<ep>
    Why are bad guys in action movies always killed in order of wickedness (--) first the henchmen, then the lieutenants and finally the mastermind?<ep>
    Why do women in Woody Allen movies always tell him how great he is in bed?<ep>
    Why do cops with a week left before retirement always have their worst week ever (--) and then decide <m0>not<m0> to retire?<ep>
   What follows are some standard plots of today's movies. These might not include everything, but they cover a lot of ground. <m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box)<m0> Dysfunctional Family Comes Together in the Course of Killing a Psycho: This is the plot of the new James Foley movie, <m0>Fear,<m0>  not to mention <m0>Cape Fear.<m0>  Psychos used to intrude on happy domesticity. Today they provide an opportunity for families to work out their issues.<ep>
   <m0>(box)<m0> Cop Protects a Woman and They Both Fall in Love (and Kill a Psycho): Except in Meg Ryan movies, the path of love these days is strewn with corpses (--) as in <m0>The Bodyguard<m0>  or the Madeleine Stowe movies <m0>Blink<m0>  and <m0>Last of the Mohicans<m0>  (think about it).<ep>
   <m0>(box)<m0> Likable Black Racist Becomes Cuddly After Sharing Adventure With Likable White Guy: Samuel L. Jackson played in two of these (--) with Nicolas Cage in <m0>Amos and Andrew<m0>  and, more recently, with Bruce Willis in <m0>Die Hard With a Vengeance.<m0>  Interestingly, the trend doesn't reverse: White racists in movies never become cuddly, and usually end up dead.<ep>
   <m0>(box)<m0> Evil Woman Destroys Sap: Stories about sexy, evil women pop up during times when sex is equated with danger (--) like today, with <m0>Basic Instinct,<m0>  <m0>Body of Evidence,<m0>  <m0>Red Rock West<m0>  and <m0>The Last Seduction.<m0> <ep>
   <m0>(box)<m0> A Sly Opportunist Finds His Spiritual Center: This is Richard Gere's role (<m0>Power,<m0>  <m0>An Officer and a Gentleman<m0> ), but with some variations, this role was also played by Clark Gable. People like to believe those gorgeous hunks are deep-down good.<ep>
   <m0>(box)<m0> Dedicated Teacher's Moral Example Transforms Rotten Kids: This has been the story from <m0>Blackboard Jungle<m0>  through <m0>Dangerous Minds.<m0>  That's why it was refreshing to see Tom Berenger hedge his bets in <m0>The Substitute<m0>  by packing a .45.<ep>
   <m0>(box)<m0> Wife Throws Out Cheating Husband But Takes the Bum Back in the End: This has been such a standard plot, from the early '20s through Julia Roberts in <m0>Something to Talk About,<m0>  that when Jill Clayburgh refused to take Michael Murphy back in <m0>An Unmarried Woman,<m0>  it was hailed as a feminist statement. Curiously, the reverse plot is never filmed: When a husband throws a wife out for cheating, it never ends with him taking her back.<ep>
   <m0>(box)<m0> He Tries to Go Straight, But They Pull Him Back In: The reformed crook who gets pulled back into a life of crime is a movie staple, twice played by Al Pacino in the '90s (<m0>Carlito's Way,<m0>  <m0>Godfather III<m0> ) and by David Caruso last year in <m0>Kiss of Death.<m0> <ep>
   <m0>(box)<m0> Vampires: In the past year there have been four vampire movies: <m0>Dracula, Dead and Loving It,<m0>  <m0>From Dusk Till Dawn,<m0>  <m0>The Addiction<m0>  and <m0>Nadja.<m0>  The vampire is an all-purpose nightmare figure (--) representing sex, spiritual death, conformity or anything else the film maker chooses.<ep>
   <m0>(box)<m0> Homespun (Sometimes Retarded) Fellow Finds His Way to the Center of Political Power by Mouthing Platitudes: <m0>Forrest Gump<m0>  is the egregious recent example. Also in this category are <m0>Being There<m0>  and Capra's populist films, <m0>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,<m0>  <m0>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington<m0>  and <m0>Meet John Doe.<m0> <ep>
   <m0>(box)<m0> Underdog, Underclass Talent Shows He/She Has the Stuff: Like the above, this is the kind of fantasy democracies can't resist, with <m0>Rocky,<m0>  <m0>Flashdance<m0>  and (--) yes (--) <m0>Showgirls<m0>  being examples.<ep>
   (box) Tough Cop Almost Loses His Job After Harassing Well-Connected Criminal Kingpin No One Knows Is a Crook: Clint Eastwood is usually threatened with dismissal in his detective movies, sometimes because his immediate superior is on the take.<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   (box) Oh No! Is Papa a Nazi? The answer is always yes, whether it's <m0>Father<m0>  with Max von Sydow, <m0>The Music Box<m0>  with Jessica Lange or the recent <m0>Getting Away With Murder<m0>  with Jack Lemmon. An innocent man hounded by sincere but mistaken Holocaust victims would be too controversial. Related are movies such as <m0>Shadow of a Doubt<m0>  (1943) and <m0>Suspicion<m0>  (1941), where a family member is suspected of murder.<ep>
   (box) Two Guys and a Gal: In three-way friendships, both men always end up having sex with the woman, whether it's <m0>Play It Again, Sam,<m0>  <m0>Jules and Jim,<m0>  <m0>Threesome<m0>  (with Lara Flynn Boyle) (--) or the more chaste variant, <m0>The Philadelphia Story<m0>  (1940).<ep>
   (box) Happy-Go-Lucky Boy and Girl Drive Around and Kill People: <m0>Bonnie and Clyde<m0>  and <m0>Badlands<m0>  have given way to <m0>Kalifornia<m0>  and <m0>Natural Born Killers.<m0> <ep>
   (box) Obnoxious Men Congratulate Themselves for Their Immaturity and Talk About How Much They Adore Women: A modern trend: <m0>The Brothers McMullen,<m0>  <m0>Beautiful Girls<m0>  and the upcoming <m0>Palookaville.<m0> <ep>
   (box) Hate at First Sight Turns to Love: The oldest one in the book. Recent example: <m0>French Kiss,<m0>  with Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline.<ep>
