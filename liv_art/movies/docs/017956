<m0>CARRINGTON<ql>
<m1> <m0>(star)(star) 1/2<m0> This <m1> <m0>period piece, set mostly in post-World War I England, is a doleful study of unrequited love, built around painter Dora Carrington's fawning worship of author Lytton Strachey (Jonathan Pryce). She (Emma Thompson) was a woman superhumanly unselfish (--) sharing not only her country cottages with the homosexual Strachey but also the charms of her <m1> <m0>husband (Steven Waddington). <m1> <m0>It's worth seeing <m1> <m0>just to hear what stinging observation the Eminent Victorians author will unleash next. <m0>(--) Jackie Potts<m0> (R; vulgar language, sexual situations, brief nudity.) (1995, Gramercy/PolyGram, $96.99, 122 minutes; available on video disc.)<ep>

A young black man enlists in the Marines in 1969, serves in Vietnam and returns home to the Bronx in 1972 (--) a time of recession and revolution.

<m1> <m0>IT TAKES TWO<ql>
<m1> <m0>(star)(star) 1/2 <m0>TV's chirpy Olsen twins revive Hayley Mills' dual roles in this <m0>Parent Trap-<m0>inspired romp, which, despite its relentless cheer, is hard to resist. Mary-Kate is a gum-chewing, tomboy orphan and Ashley is the oh-so-polite daughter of a dapper, cellular-phone magnate (Steve Guttenberg). The two collide, literally, at a summer camp and conspire to pull the ol' switcheroo, hoping to match the orphanage's winsome case worker (Kirstie Alley) with the heiress' hunky dad (Guttenberg) and ditch his shrewish fiance (<m0>Friends<m0>'<m0> <m0>Jane Sibbet) in the bargain. <m0>(--) Jackie Potts <m0>(PG; no offensive material.)
