<m0>   Hollywood directors fade in and out of focus, but Alan Smithee endures (--) and will likely reap more credits.<ep>
   Directors hide behind the pseudonym Alan Smithee when they want to disassociate themselves from a dud. But the ruse has come to be recognized by film buffs and movie critics as a seal of disapproval and now is regarded by the studios and producers that finance movies as a kiss of death.<ep>
   ``What you don't want is to have Alan Smithee directing one of your movies,'' says Stan Rosenfield, a spokesman for Robert De Niro's Tribeca Productions. ``It sends out a message you don't want out there.''<ep>
   But as the digital age unfolds, the credit ``Directed by Alan Smithee'' is expected to roll across more screens. Already, altering films to accommodate a different medium is growing more common. To directors' dismay, movies are cut to be shown on airplanes or colorized to appear on Ted Turner's networks. And with film clips already zipping across the Internet and movies being planned for digital disks, directors worry about the impact of new technologies on their finished products.<ep>
<m1>Altering a vision<ep>
<m0>   ``As the opportunities to manipulate images increase exponentially, the opportunities to alter a director's vision are growing just as rapidly,'' says John Sloss, an entertainment attorney who represents a number of directors.<ep>
   Enter Alan Smithee. Director David Lynch substituted the Smithee name for his own when his sci-fi epic <m0>Dune <m0>was cut to appear on TV.<ep>
   But sometimes the mere threat of a Smithee credit does the trick, as was the case of the recently opened <m0>Faithful,<m0> a dark comedy starring Ryan O'Neal and Cher.<ep>
   <m0>Faithful <m0>was directed by Paul Mazursky, whose credits include <m0>Moscow on the Hudson,<m0> <m0>Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice<m0> and <m0>Enemies, a Love Story.<m0> A few months ago, according to people familiar with the situation, Mazursky expressed displeasure with the cut being prepared for release by the film's producer, Tribeca, and threatened to hide behind Alan Smithee if he didn't get the cut he wanted.<ep>
   ``He got his cut,'' says Tribeca's Rosenfield. ``His name is on the film.''<ep>
   Mazursky did not respond to faxed letters seeking comment; his movie recently opened to mixed reviews and has had scant box-office receipts.<ep>
<m1>Meant to be a shield<ep>
<m0>   Gene Reynolds, the president of the Directors Guild of America, acknowledges that the Alan Smithee designation was initially meant to be used as a shield for directors to protect their reputations, not a cudgel for them to brandish. Musing about the possibility of creating an alternative pseudonym to Alan Smithee that would be unknown to the public (at least for a time) and thus lose force as a threat, Reynolds immediately shoots down the idea, declaring: ``I'm all in favor of its use as a deterrent. That may be a good reason to stick with it.''<ep>
   The origin of Alan Smithee is murky. Reynolds says the name was first used by actors playing two parts in turn-of-the-century melodramas. Directors have been using it as the only substitute approved by the Guild since the late 1960s, when one director was fired from the Richard Widmark western, <m0>Death of a Gunfighter,<m0> and his replacement balked at taking credit for the movie.<ep>
   A director must formally apply to the guild to receive permission to take his name off a film, and it is a step many don't take lightly. The pseudonym fools no one in Hollywood and can bring a director unwanted attention in the industry.<ep>
   ``It sort of points an arrow at you,'' complains director Rick Rosenthal, who after losing numerous battles over the screenplay and editing of <m0>Birds II: Land's End, <m0>took his name off the 1994 sequel to the Hitchcock classic.<ep>
<m1>Top secret<ep>
<m0>   The pen name has been invoked only about two dozen times since then, although the Directors Guild won't disclose the precise number of films that carry the badge of shame. ``We are obliged not to discredit the films'' that have been Alan Smitheed, Reynolds says.<ep>
   A recent Smithee film, in fact the directorial debut of 33-year-old Kevin Yagher, is <m0>Hellraiser: Bloodline.<m0> It's the fourth installment in the horrific saga of Pinhead, a character who literally has pins sticking out all over his head, and its three predecessors were tough acts to follow: They had a cult following and had even been well-received by some critics.<ep>
   From the outset, Yagher was plagued by disasters, natural and otherwise. ``We had a fire, we had a flood and the crew struck,'' he recalls. As the shooting schedule lurched forward, the producers demanded numerous reshoots, says Yagher, thus draining the script of ``elegance and sophistication.'' After seeing the final cut several months ago, he decided to have his name removed.<ep>
   If the move shielded Yagher from public scorn, it didn't help the film: A review in the Chicago Tribune said: ``The first warning sign that there might be something fetid about <m0>Hellraiser: Bloodline <m0>. . . was the telling fact that it was directed by `Alan Smithee.' ''<ep>
<m1>Difference of opinion<ep>
<m0>   The film, which opened last month and is still playing in some parts of the country, was produced by Dimension Films, part of Walt Disney Co.-owned Miramax Films. A Dimension spokeswoman says, ``There was a difference of opinion about the direction of the final film,'' adding that the parting with Yagher was ``amicable.''<ep>
   Screenwriters, who are more accustomed to having their work savaged by committee, have come up with an alternative to Alan Smithee: They can create their own aliases. Robert Towne, the Oscar-winning writer of <m0>Chinatown, <m0>put his dog's name, P.H. Vazak, on the script of <m0>Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes.<m0><ep>
   Towne was stunned when the script and his dog ended up getting nominated for an Oscar. Still, he has only one regret in the assignment of credit: ``The dog deserved to have his name on a better picture than that.''<ql>
