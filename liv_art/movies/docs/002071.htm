MADISON COUNTY: Meryl Streep, Clint Eastwood.<BR>
<BR>
THE BRIDGES <BR>
OF MADISON<BR>
COUNTY<BR>
*** 1/2 Robert James Waller's phenomenally bestselling (and critically reviled) melodrama about a farm wife's affair with a photographer in 1965 Iowa has been turned into a resonant, richly rewarding film. Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep play the lovers, and both deliver haunting, Oscar-caliber performances that amplify the story's themes of impossible love, sacrifice and devotion. Eastwood, who also directed in typical languorous fashion, has turned Waller's purple prose into something much greater. -- Rene Rodriguez (PG-13, vulgar language, brief nudity, sexual situations.) (1995, Warner, 135 minutes.)<BR>

AN UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER<BR>
** 1/2 A gentle tragedy set in 1925 Romania about a married noblewoman for whom no good deed goes unpunished. She is gracefully played by Kristin Scott-Thomas, who chooses to see individuals as humans rather than as members of ethnic groups. The plot is gauze-thin; the heroine's character is solid. In French, Romanian and Bulgarian with English subtitles. -- Knight-Ridder Newspapers (No MPAA rating; nudity, violence, sex.) (1994, New Yorker, $89.95, 82 minutes.)<P>

<BR>
WAITING TO EXHALE<BR>
** Terry McMillan's bestselling novel about the friendship between four lovelorn African-American women has been turned into a glib, shallow male-bashing tract that is a better conversation starter than it is a piece of human drama. Angela Bassett shines as a woman unexpectedly hurled into a messy divorce, and Wesley Snipes does wonders in a cameo role as the man who helps her out of her emotional shell shock, but the rest of the cast (including Whitney Houston, in a stiff and cold performance) fares badly, and Forest Whitaker directs with all the finesse of a half-hour sitcom. -- Rene Rodriguez (R; vulgar language, sexual situations.) (1995, Fox, $19.98, 124 minutes.)<P>

Garcia<BR>
<BR>
STEAL BIG, STEAL LITTLE<BR>
* Andy Garcia does double duty in this failed fable as twin brothers, one good and one bad, doing battle over a fat inheritance, but even his considerable charm can't save this misguided dud. Director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive)  seems to have forgotten how to make a good movie: This comedy, reportedly a pet project of his, is wildly overlong, unfocused, and so scattershot it's hard to say what Davis' intent was. A massive misfire. -- Rene Rodriguez (PG-13; vulgar language, brief violence.) (1995, Savoy/HBO, 135 minutes; available on video disc.)<BR>
