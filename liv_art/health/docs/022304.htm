   BOSTON -- (AP) -- Keeping the operating room chilly for the comfort of the surgeons raises the patient's risk of infection dramatically and slows healing, a study found. The simple and highly effective solution: blankets.<P>

   Typically, operating rooms are kept around 65 degrees so heavily gowned surgeons won't sweat under the bright lights. Making matters worse, anesthesia interferes with the body's ability to regulate its own temperature. As a result, patients often cool down during surgery to around 94.5 degrees.<P>

Doctors concerned about this set out to see what would happen if they kept patients at about a normal 98 degrees during surgery. They heated up the intravenous fluids and covered the patients with special air-warmed blankets.<P>

   The extra attention cost $30, and the benefits were substantial. Patients having colon operations suffered only one-third the usual surgical wound infections. They healed faster and were sent home sooner.<P>

   ``Isn't it amazing that something that is risk-free and has such trivial cost provides such benefit?'' said Dr. Daniel I. Sessler, one of the researchers.<P>

   Dr. Sessler, an anesthesiologist at the University of California at San Francisco, described the experiment in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.<P>

   Being cold inhibits the body's defenses against germs. It decreases blood flow to the skin, lowering the supply of oxygen, which is necessary to fight infection, and interferes with blood clotting.<P>

   Sessler predicted that keeping patients warm will soon be routine practice. An editorial in the journal agreed, provided more studies show the same thing.<P>

   Sessler said he thinks nearly all kinds of surgery will go better if patients are kept warm. The only exceptions are carotid artery surgery and some other procedures where lower temperatures help protect the brain, and heart surgery, where intentional cooling reduces the heart's oxygen needs.<P>

   In the study, patients undergoing surgery at three hospitals in Austria were randomly assigned to either have their operations the usual chilly way or to be kept warm. Six percent of the warmed patients developed wound infections during their recovery, compared with 19 percent of those who had gotten cold. <P>

   Sessler said staying warm during operations also eliminates another unpleasant side effect of surgery -- waking up with bone-deep cold that lasts for hours.<P>

   The blanket used in the operating room is a disposable quilt. It is filled with warm air and placed beneath the surgical drape that covers the patient.
