<m0>ou know it by a name that rings funny: mad cow disease, a deadly but rare ailment, found far away in England.<ep>
   Mayra Lichter knows it far more personally.<ep>
   Her father was stricken with the human variation, a little-known, little-understood condition called Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. It killed him in four months, stunning his family, inspiring them to establish a national foundation in Miami devoted to understanding the disease and offering clues to families watching relatives slip into an abyss of dementia.<ep>
<m1>Someone to talk to<ep>
<m0>   ``I can't cure it, I can't give them hope, but I can give them someone to talk to,'' says Lichter, a former federal prosecutor. ``This isn't the kind of disease where we're going to have a telethon and a poster person and go around with cans soliciting donations.<ep>
   ``But I couldn't walk away from this disease. It was too mysterious, it was too devastating.''<ep>
   It has achieved newfound notoriety amid a British frenzy over the nation's beef stock. Researchers discovered in 1986 that disoriented cattle had been stricken with mad cow disease (--) known scientifically as bovine spongiform encephalopathy. <m1><ep>
<m1>Origins debated<ep>
<m0>   Debate has embroiled scientists since, with suspicions that the illness affecting British cattle lingers in beef sold at stores and can make humans sick. The condition humans develop: Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. It is presumed, though not proved, that the 10 people felled in Britain are victims of the cow illness crossing the barrier into humans.<ep>
   But researchers believe in most cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, there is not such an obvious link. Striking roughly one person in a million, CJD is stealthy, believed to lurk in the body sometimes for decades before a fog of confusion drifts over the brain, blotting out old memories and altering personality.<ep>
<m1>Cases climbed<ep>
<m0>    Doctors at Jackson Memorial Hospital tracked cases from 1984 to 1993, uncovering an increase during that period. Between 1984 and 1989, there was an average of one case a year. The average climbed to 4.75 a year from 1990 to 1993.<ep>
   Writing in the journal Neurology, the researchers concluded that Creutzfeldt-Jakob ``may be increasing in incidence in our community.'' A teenager named Joseph Sardo helped the experts in their sleuthing. The disease claimed his father in 1989.<ep>
   ``I told my son, we've got to take a negative and make a positive out of it,'' says Cecile Sardo, who lives in South Dade.<ep>

MAD COW DISEASE,  FROM  1C<ql>
<m0>Her husband Joseph, 56, worked for Metro-Dade government for two dozen years, a meticulous administrator in data processing. ``My husband was the kind of person, whenever they had a big problem at work they said, let Joe handle it.''<ep>
   There was one thing he couldn't handle, a disease that began to play tricks with his mind. On a cruise to the Caribbean, Joe Sardo, once so gregarious, withdrew, making excuses about why he wasn't casting his lot at the blackjack table.<ep>
   Visits to neurologists and cardiologists ensued. Maybe, they said, it's a stroke. Maybe, they offered, it's early Alzheimer's. They took pictures of his brain and heart, but everything ended up negative.<ep>
   Still, the bizarre episodes persisted. There was the time in the hospital when the nurse told Joe he needed to remain in bed after a procedure and, just minutes later, Cecile walked into the room and found her husband standing in the bathroom.<ep>
<m1>The twilight zone<ep>
<m0>   ``It was bizarre, like being in the twilight zone (--) in your life, you can't imagine this,'' says Cecile Sardo. ``I know when you're handed a diagnosis, it's horrible, but at least you know what you're dealing with. When you don't know what you're dealing with, it's worse.''<ep>
   Finally, a specialist in infectious diseases, Dr. Joseph Berger, was summoned. He told the Sardos he was 98 percent certain Joe bore the imprint of Creutzfeldt-Jakob.<ep>
   The disease is difficult to diagnose because, unlike most infections, it leave no obvious calling card, no fever, no rash. Researchers now believe it is caused not by a virus, not by bacteria, but possibly by something that contains protein that transforms healthy, benign proteins in the body into killers.<ep>
   ``The disease starts very ambiguously, and it is often misdiagnosed, not through incompetence, but just because it's not well known,'' says Mayra Lichter.<ep>
<m1>Father had symptoms<ep>
<m0>   Her family became immersed in the mystery in November 1992, when the symptoms first started stalking her father Felix Reyler, who spent the second half of his life as a pioneer in international banking in Miami after a career as an attorney in Cuba.<ep>
   ``I remember the last time my father said anything, it was Feb. 14, and he wished my mother a happy Valentine's Day,'' says Lichter.<ep>
   Reyler, 74, died March 3, four months after his wife and children first detected symptoms. There was the onslaught of usual emotions: depression, anger.<ep>
   There was this, too: a desire to ease the pain of other families by imparting information and wisdom.<ep>
   ``It made me feel better to do something,'' Lichter says, ``to find some meaning in my father's death. And in the back of my mind, I always thought it would take something like this panic in Britain to focus more attention.''<ql>
