<m0>   BOSTON (--) (AP) (--) Keeping the operating room chilly for the comfort of the surgeons raises the patient's risk of infection dramatically and slows healing, a study found. The simple and highly effective solution: blankets.<ep>
   Typically, operating rooms are kept around 65 degrees so heavily gowned surgeons won't sweat under the bright lights. Making matters worse, anesthesia interferes with the body's ability to regulate its own temperature. As a result, patients often cool down during surgery to around 94.5 degrees.<ep>
   Concerned doctors set out to see what would happen if they kept patients at about a normal 98 degrees during surgery. They heated up the intravenous fluids and covered the patients with special air-warmed blankets. The extra attention cost $30.<ep>
   Patients having colon operations suffered only one-third the usual surgical wound infections. They healed faster and were sent home sooner.<ep>
   ``Isn't it amazing that something that is risk-free and has such trivial cost provides such benefit?'' said Dr. Daniel Sessler, one of the researchers.<ep>
   Being cold inhibits the body's defenses against germs. It decreases blood flow to the skin, lowering the supply of oxygen, which is necessary to fight infection, and interferes with blood clotting.<ep>
