mature baby.<ep>
   Until now, concern about a deficiency of folic acid has focused on early pregnancy.<ep>
   But researchers now say results of a new study show that consuming adequate amounts of the trace B vitamin was also important in mid- and late-term pregnancy (--) and that pregnant women should give special attention to eating foods high in the nutrient or taking vitamin supplements that contain it.<ep>
   ``These results indicate folic acid is not just important early in pregnancy and that there are reasons to maintain adequate levels throughout pregnancy,'' said the lead researcher, Dr. Theresa Scholl of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.<ep>
   In a study in the April issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the researchers said they found that even small increases in the women's serum folic acid concentrations by the 28th week of pregnancy decreased the odds of preterm delivery and the chance of having a baby of low birth weight.<ep>
   Foods rich in folic acid include leafy dark green vegetables, citrus fruits and juices, kidney and lima beans and whole-grain cereals.<ep>
   By Jan. 1, 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will require makers of enriched breads, flour, pasta, corn meals, rice and certain other foods to fortify them with enough folic acid so that women receive 10 percent of the daily recommended level, 400 micrograms, from each serving.<ql>

<m0>   Long-term use of a widely prescribed heartburn drug may be hazardous if people are also infected with Helicobacter pylori, a common germ linked to stomach ulcers and cancer.<ep>
   That's according to a study in last week's New England Journal of Medicine.<ep>
   The drug, Prilosec, is often given to suppress stomach acid. But lower acid levels also allow H. pylori bacteria to cause more stomach inflammation.<ep>
   In a new study, conducted in the Netherlands and paid for by a Swedish subsidiary of Prilosec's manufacturer, doctors found that years of Prilosec treatment in victims of severe heartburn disease led to precancerous changes in the stomach lining if they were also infected with H. pylori.<ql>
