   If you want to have great-looking arms, you have to work your triceps -- the muscles at the back of the upper arms. To do that, many of us assume that you have to spend hours in the weight room. But you can modify traditional weight-room exercises for the triceps to do at home.<P>

   Start with an exercise called the triceps kickback. You'll need the following: a water bottle (or a similar container that's just small enough to be easily held in one hand), a firm sofa approximately knee height and some sand or water.<P>

   Fill the container with water or sand until it weighs between two and 10 pounds. (Adjust the weight to your capability.) The exercise position is exactly the same as in the weight room. Place your right knee and hand on the sofa. Keeping both your elbow and your knee slightly bent, grab the water bottle or container with your free hand, and bring your elbow up so your upper arm is parallel to the ground and close to your body. In this position, contract the triceps to extend the arm. Repeat 10 to 15 times, then do the same on the other side.<P>

   You can alter the difficulty by adjusting the amount of water in the container. A few comfort tips: Try not to look up because it puts your neck in unnecessary hyperextension; make sure the container is easy to grasp with one hand; and resist gravity by controlling the weight on the way up and down.<P>

   The overhead triceps extension can also be done using a similar type of container. In this one, you are seated with your arms overhead, and then you extend at the elbow. If you use the same container you chose for the kickback, you will want to use twice as much sand or water because you're using both arms.<P>

   A third exercise, the reverse curl, can be accomplished by lying on your back and extending the arm up from the forehead, using the same equipment or even a big book -- like a phone book.<P>

   Next, give the dip a try. You'll need only a sturdy chair or bench with a wide base of support. Place your hands on the chair with your fingers pointed toward your toes. Put both legs in front of you and your feet on the floor. Now, raise and lower yourself by bending and extending at the elbow. It's important to keep your body close to the chair and your elbows pointed directly behind you to avoid unwanted stress on the shoulder joint. You can modify this exercise to the floor for an easier version. Remember: no more than 90 degree of flex in the elbow.<P>

   Many triceps exercises can be done with a partner. To simulate a triceps pushdown, you'll need a towel folded in half. Have your partner hold the folded end. Grab the two loose ends. The starting position is arms close to the body and elbows bent 90 degrees. From here, try to extend your arms down while your partner provides resistance.<P>

   The same method can be used in an overhead extension. Hold the folded end, and try to extend your arms up overhead while your partner pulls down on the free ends.<P>
