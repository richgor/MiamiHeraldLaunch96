<m0>   NEW YORK (--) (AP) (--) Some people driven by obsessions and compulsions such as excessive hand washing got significant relief when treated over the phone by a computer that said such things as: ``Is cleaning or washing a major problem for you? If yes, press 1. If no, press 2.''<ep>
   The computer, along with a written manual, helped the patients plan exercises that taught them to control their urges, researcher Dr. John Greist said.<ep>
   This behavior-modifying strategy has been shown to be effective, but it's not widely offered by human therapists, Greist said. The high-tech approach, in contrast, can be available anywhere there is a push-button phone.<ep>
   Greist, a psychiatrist at the Dean Foundation in Madison, Wis., presented the results of his technique Wednesday at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.<ep>
   An estimated five million Americans have obsessive-compulsive disorder, marked by unwanted, anxiety-provoking thoughts, usually with ritual behavior to relieve the anxiety. The rituals can occupy several hours a day, interfering with normal life.<ep>
   Common obsessions include fears of being contaminated, harming another person or making a mistake. Common rituals include hand washing, checking locks and arranging objects in a precise order. People with the disorder understand that the rituals are foolish but can't avoid them.<ep>
   For the study, researchers programmed a computer to react to information patients entered with a push-button phone, and to talk back with more than 700 taped messages. Patients, who were diagnosed and referred to the program by a mental health professional, also used a printed workbook.<ep>
   Patients entered such information as how many hours a day they spent on their rituals, how much money they spent on expenses like extra soap for excessive hand washing and which of more than 170 situations or objects triggered their obsessions.<ep>
   They learned to identify precisely what set off their obsessions, like a particular doorknob they thought gave them germs. And they set specific goals such as touching that doorknob, and then touching their counter tops and bed linen at home without washing for three hours thereafter. <ep>
   Later they would call back and tell the computer how their attempt went.<ep>
   Forty patients participated in the 12-week study. Of the 17 who completed two or more exercises, 75 percent reported that they were much improved or very much improved. A standard measure of obsessive-compulsive symptoms also showed a drop over the treatment period.<ep>
