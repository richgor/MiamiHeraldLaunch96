ou know it by a name that rings funny: mad cow disease, a deadly but rare ailment, found far away in England.<P>

   Mayra Lichter knows it far more personally.<P>

   Her father was stricken with the human variation, a little-known, little-understood condition called Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. It killed him in four months, stunning his family, inspiring them to establish a national foundation in Miami devoted to understanding the disease and offering clues to families watching relatives slip into an abyss of dementia.<P>

   ``I can't cure it, I can't give them hope, but I can give them someone to talk to,'' says Lichter, a former federal prosecutor. ``This isn't the kind of disease where we're going to have a telethon and a poster person and go around with cans soliciting donations.<P>

   ``But I couldn't walk away from this disease. It was too mysterious, it was too devastating.''<P>

   It has achieved newfound notoriety amid a British frenzy over the nation's beef stock. Researchers discovered in 1986 that disoriented cattle had been stricken with mad cow disease -- known scientifically as bovine spongiform encephalopathy.    Debate has embroiled scientists since, with suspicions that the illness affecting British cattle lingers in beef sold at stores and can make humans sick. The condition humans develop: Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. It is presumed, though not proved, that the 10 people felled in Britain are victims of the cow illness crossing the barrier into humans.<P>

   But researchers believe in most cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, there is not such an obvious link. Striking roughly one person in a million, CJD is stealthy, believed to lurk in the body sometimes for decades before a fog of confusion drifts over the brain, blotting out old memories and altering personality.<P>

    Doctors at Jackson Memorial Hospital tracked cases from 1984 to 1993, uncovering an increase during that period. Between 1984 and 1989, there was an average of one case a year. The average climbed to 4.75 a year from 1990 to 1993.<P>

   Writing in the journal Neurology, the researchers concluded that Creutzfeldt-Jakob ``may be increasing in incidence in our community.'' A teenager named Joseph Sardo helped the experts in their sleuthing. The disease claimed his father in 1989.<P>

   ``I told my son, we've got to take a negative and make a positive out of it,'' says Cecile Sardo, who lives in South Dade.<P>

</PRE>
Her husband Joseph, 56, worked for Metro-Dade government for two dozen years, a meticulous administrator in data processing. ``My husband was the kind of person, whenever they had a big problem at work they said, let Joe handle it.''<P>

   There was one thing he couldn't handle, a disease that began to play tricks with his mind. On a cruise to the Caribbean, Joe Sardo, once so gregarious, withdrew, making excuses about why he wasn't casting his lot at the blackjack table.<P>

   Visits to neurologists and cardiologists ensued. Maybe, they said, it's a stroke. Maybe, they offered, it's early Alzheimer's. They took pictures of his brain and heart, but everything ended up negative.<P>

   Still, the bizarre episodes persisted. There was the time in the hospital when the nurse told Joe he needed to remain in bed after a procedure and, just minutes later, Cecile walked into the room and found her husband standing in the bathroom.<P>

   ``It was bizarre, like being in the twilight zone -- in your life, you can't imagine this,'' says Cecile Sardo. ``I know when you're handed a diagnosis, it's horrible, but at least you know what you're dealing with. When you don't know what you're dealing with, it's worse.''<P>

   Finally, a specialist in infectious diseases, Dr. Joseph Berger, was summoned. He told the Sardos he was 98 percent certain Joe bore the imprint of Creutzfeldt-Jakob.<P>

   The disease is difficult to diagnose because, unlike most infections, it leave no obvious calling card, no fever, no rash. Researchers now believe it is caused not by a virus, not by bacteria, but possibly by something that contains protein that transforms healthy, benign proteins in the body into killers.<P>

   ``The disease starts very ambiguously, and it is often misdiagnosed, not through incompetence, but just because it's not well known,'' says Mayra Lichter.<P>

   Her family became immersed in the mystery in November 1992, when the symptoms first started stalking her father Felix Reyler, who spent the second half of his life as a pioneer in international banking in Miami after a career as an attorney in Cuba.<P>

   ``I remember the last time my father said anything, it was Feb. 14, and he wished my mother a happy Valentine's Day,'' says Lichter.<P>

   Reyler, 74, died March 3, four months after his wife and children first detected symptoms. There was the onslaught of usual emotions: depression, anger.<P>

   There was this, too: a desire to ease the pain of other families by imparting information and wisdom.<P>

   ``It made me feel better to do something,'' Lichter says, ``to find some meaning in my father's death. And in the back of my mind, I always thought it would take something like this panic in Britain to focus more attention.''<BR>
