<m0>   NEW YORK (--) The latest drugs to help fight depression may also hurt sexual function, prompting many to abandon the treatments. Now, a study has pinpointed a drug that allows people to treat the devastating disorder and keep their intimate relations healthy.<ep>
   Utah researchers have found that one of the latest anti-depressants on the market (--) Serzone, manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb (--) was much less likely to leave patients with miserable sex lives.<ep>
   Doctors first noticed that as many as 80 percent of patients receiving the newest antidepressants, including Prozac and Zoloft, were experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction, not as a remnant of the depression but as a side effect of the treatment.<ep>
   Noting this effect, Dr. James Ferguson of the University of Utah recruited a number of people who experienced sexual problems while on antidepressants for a study of the issue. Forty-four patients were then put on either Zoloft, a medication sold by Pfizer, or on Serzone.<ep>
   They were followed for eight weeks and continuously answered a series of intimate questions about their sex lives. In the Zoloft-treated group, 80 percent re-experienced sexual dysfunction compared with 30 percent of those taking Serzone.<ep>
   ``Patients generally don't want to talk about these problems,'' said Ferguson, who said that the sexual difficulties run from delayed ejaculation to loss of desire.<ep>
   Ferguson and others say that Serzone does not work like Zoloft or Prozac but alleviates depression in similar ways.<ep>
   Ferguson reported his findings Wednesday at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting in New York.<ep>
   Other studies presented at the conference support this finding. No one knows why or how sexual function is targeted by these drugs.<ep>
   But depressed patients should think twice before switching drugs, doctors say. There is strong evidence from a Harvard study that taking a break (--) such as a weekend free of medication (--) will prevent the bothersome side effects without compromising the treatment.<ep>
   Harvard's Dr. Anthony Rothschild found that these drug holidays worked for the antidepressants Paxil and Zoloft but not Prozac. Also a common antihistamine has been used that reverses this side effect.<ep>
   ``These are powerful, well-tolerated drugs and the importance is that they work in alleviating serious depression,'' said Pfizer's Dr. Wilma Harrison. ``Let's focus on what's important here.''<ep>
