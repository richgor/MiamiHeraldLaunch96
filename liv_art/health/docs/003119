<m0>   In the next several years, I'll need knee-replacement surgery. I'm 68 and have met several men who have had this procedure. Some have painful war stories. I'm delaying this surgery because, first, my knee problems aren't yet at a critical point and, second, I'm not looking forward to the pain. Is pain inevitable and something I'm supposed to ``take like a man?''<ql>

<m0>   Knowing how pain will be dealt with is an integral part of surgical planning and should be discussed and understood as well as the surgery itself. Being stoic is not necessary (--) in fact, it may not be good for your health, experts say.<ep>
   Every year, about 23 million surgical procedures are performed in the United States, and a recent survey found that about three of four surgical patients experienced unrelieved pain from being under-medicated. Even though federal guidelines that were widely circulated in 1992 made clear that such pain can and should be prevented through hospital pain-management programs, only 54 percent of U.S. hospitals have them, according to Dr. Carol Warfield, director of the Pain Management Center at Beth Israel Hospital and a professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School.<ep>
   Experts don't believe coping with pain is a noble virtue. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``Studies have proved that complication rates are higher if pain is not managed during the postoperative period,'' says Warfield. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Among the problems pain can cause:<ep>
   (box) The body's response to pain may include increases in heart rate and blood pressure. This may overtax the heart, causing cardiac problems.<ep>
   (box) Pain can cause you to take shallow breaths and refrain from coughing, which can lead to pneumonia.<ep>
   (box) Pain may keep you from moving about, and a host of problems can result from remaining in bed too long. For instance, blood clots can develop in the legs; if those break free, they can cause strokes or heart attacks.<ep>
   (box) Unmanaged pain creates anxiety. Studies have shown that such stress can depress the immune system and make a patient more susceptible to infection and even tumors.<ep>
   Warfield said anyone who knows they may need any kind of surgery should meet with the anesthesiologist or, if the hospital has a pain-management program, a specialist from that program, to discuss how pain will be controlled before, during and after surgery.<ep>
   As a patient, you want to make sure whoever the pain manager is takes <m1> <m0>a thorough medical history to learn about problems that would affect the anesthesia selections, such as respiratory difficulties, bleeding problems or a drug dependency. The type of medication, how it's given (ingested, injected or fed through tubes) and how it's controlled (patient-controlled or administered) should be discussed.<ep>
   The pain-control plan should provide for regular patient checks and include orders that pain medicine be given as needed.<ep>
   As for knee-replacement surgery in particular, it produces the best results when movement of the new knee joint begins within five hours. To counter the pain this produces, specific anesthetics are used.<ep>
