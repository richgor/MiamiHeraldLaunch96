<m0>   CHICAGO (--) (AP) (--) Most of the 11 million Americans with heart disease can relax and enjoy sex if they want (--) it's highly unlikely to trigger a heart attack, a study found.<ep>
   ``There are finally numbers available to reassure these patients that sexual activity is safe,'' said Dr. James E. Muller, lead author and a heart specialist at Deaconess Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.<ep>
   Heart patients and their partners often have unspoken fears that sex will trigger a heart attack. Before this study, doctors could offer patients little more than a rule of thumb: If the patient can climb two flights of stairs without symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath, sex is probably safe, Muller said.<ep>
   ``It wasn't very reassuring,'' he said. ``It left people kind of uncertain as to whether it was really safe.''<ep>
   The study, published in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, involved 1,774 patients who had suffered heart attacks, including 858 who were sexually active in the year before. Among them, 27 reported sexual activity in the two hours preceding the attacks.<ep>
   By having sex, patients temporarily increased their chances of suffering a heart attack from 10 in a million to 20 in a million. But the starting risk is so low that doubling it isn't dangerous, Muller said.<ep>
