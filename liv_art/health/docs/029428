<m0>   Women can learn the latest about a myriad of health issues (--) and get a free dinner (--) at the 15th Women's Multiethnic Healthcare Conference, to be held in 10 locations Thursday.<ep>
  ``The sessions are hands-on, with no medical jargon,'' promised Lynn Leight, executive director of SHE (Sex, Health, Education) Center, which is sponsoring the conference with the Dade County Commission on the Status of Women and The Herald.<ep>
