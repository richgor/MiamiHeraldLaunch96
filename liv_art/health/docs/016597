<m0>n the 1950s, the physician was god. You did what he said, no questions.<ep>
   Then came the 1970s, the heady beginning of patient consumerism. You read up on illness, asked questions, shopped for doctors. An explosion of technology and medical knowledge gave rise to specialists. The general practitioner seemed out of date.<ep>
   Now come the 1990s, with cost concerns and managed care. Specialists are a luxury, and primary-care physicians feel pressure to work faster. Changes in insurance plans may require patients to find new doctors.<ep>
   The doctor-patient relationship may be suffering.<ep>
   Harried patients aren't the only ones concerned. Doctors are putting their relationship with patients under the microscope.<ep>
``The patient-physician relationship is under siege,'' began an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association earlier this year. With that, the weekly journal launched a regular feature on the topic.<ep>
   While academics debate, <m1> <m0>patients need their doctors. Whatever model of the doctor-patient relationship emerges as the ideal in coming years, the foundation probably will always be honesty and clear communication (--) both yours and the physician's.<ep>
    ``You need someone you can trust and who you can talk to,'' says Dr. Lynn Carmichael, a national leader in family medicine and chairman of that department at the University of Miami. ``You should be able to ask about things that don't usually occur in normal conversation.''<ep>
<m1>Tell everything<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   This means diet, alcohol, stresses in your life. And, yes, sex. The doctor is not being nosy or judgmental; the answers influence your health.<ep>
   ``You can't treat your physician as though he's the judge of what's moral or ethical,'' says Dr. Morton Morris, vice chancellor for Academic Affairs at Nova Southeastern University, which trains osteopathic physicians.<ep>
   To reduce the use of high-priced specialists, care increasingly is shifting to generalists, the ``primary-care providers.'' In managed-care plans such as HMOs, they decide which <m1> <m0>specialists you should see. That means your relationship with your primary-care physician will be more important than ever.<ep>
   ``You want to feel that this person is going to be your advocate (--) even more so in managed care when you <m0>need  <m0>that physician to be your advocate,'' says Vaughn Keller of the Bayer Institute for Health Care Communication.<ep>
<m1>When doctoring was simple<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   Carmichael describes the doctor as a tour guide to ``appropriate care for the optimal outcome.''<ep>
   But who defines the ``optimal outcome''?<ep>
   A few decades ago, both doctors and patients assumed shared values toward treatment. Medicine was simpler. Technology, and our growing knowledge of how our bodies work, have brought choices (--) not to mention different philosophical and cultural approaches in a community as diverse as South Florida.<ep>
  Are you someone who wants a pill immediately for an ailment? Or would you prefer to try changing your habits (--) eating, drinking, exercise (--) to get rid of your symptoms? If you had a terminal illness, would you want to extend life at all costs?<ep>
   ``In the past, it's sort of been the assumption of doctor knows best,'' Carmichael says. ``Now it's more up to the doctor to determine the patient's wishes. Decision-making is being shifted to the patient, and I think that's good.''<ep>
   Good, perhaps. But not simple.<ep>

<m1> <m0>the physician was God. Psychologically, it was easier,'' says Mildred, whose husband recently was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and asked not to be identified.<ep>
   His doctor explained the array of treatment gptions, each with pros and cons. The Hollywood couple felt overwhelmed.<ep>
   ``Assuming responsibility is not easy,'' says Mildred.<ep>
   Now faced with a difficult decision, the couple called the National Cancer Institute for free information about prostate cancer, in addition to what the doctor told them.<ep>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ep>
<m0>   ``You have to educate yourself,'' Mildred says. ``Then you know what questions to ask.''<ep>
   But is there always time for your questions?<ep>
 Sherrie Kaplan, a social scientist who has studied the doctor-patient relationship, says visits are getting shorter.<ep>
   ``Physicians everywhere, and not just in managed care, are being asked to increase productivity and efficiency, and that means shortening the length of tiee they spend face-to-face with patients,'' says Kaplan. ``If doctors are jammed for time, odds are they'll focus on the technical care and less on the interpersonal side.''<ep>
   One analysis suggests that managed-care physicians see another patient every six or seven minutes. Another analysis showed a typical time of 15 minutes per patient, regardless of whether the patient was in a managed-care group or in the more traditional fee-for-service insurance plan.<ep>
<m1>More patients, less time<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   Whatever the numbers, nearly all doctors feel pressed for time. They say they're tied up with paperwork and getting approval from insurance before going ahead with treatment. And, in many cases, competing for access to large groups of patients means accepting reduced pay. To maintain the same income, they have to squeeze in more patients.<ep>
   ``You're taught to ask open-ended questions, but it's difficult in today's world because you have to go quickly,'' says Dr. George Ibars, a neurosurgeon in South Miami.<ep>
   Doctors, when asked to analyze current problems, usually fixate on managed care. They are frustrated that their decisions on individual patients are being eclipsed by the rules of larger organizations.<ep>
   Even so, doctors are trying to improve communication with patients.<ep>
   Last year, nearly 4,000 physicians attended half-day sessions at the Bayer Institute. They are taught to reconsider the find-it-fix-it mode of interacting with patients that gives short-shrift to communication.<ep>
<m1>Doctors under a `gag rule'<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   But doctors say they are frustrated by patients who don't understand that plans keep costs down by excluding certain types of care.<ep>
   ``People have been oversold on what they think is a total policy,'' Carmichael says.<ep>
   Furthering this antagonism is what has become known as the ``gag rule,'' clauses in some agreements between physicians and managed-care companies that forbid doctors to discuss treatments that the plan does not cover. Rules sometimes forbid talking about financial arrangements that potentially affect care (--) such as whether the physician receives a set fee for taking care of each patient and whether there is a financial penalty for recommending extra tests or specialty care.<ep>
   Some patient advocates suggest asking your doctor precisely these questions, and also asking whether the doctor is working under a gag clause.<ep>
   J. Hughes, a sociologist at the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago, says this is a way to create the two-way trust that is necessary for a good doctor-patient relationship.<ep>
   ``If you do it in a way not to imply they're not out for greed, I think it's a great opportunity for a doctor to be honest with you and explain their own motivations,'' Hughes says.<ep>
