<m0>   NEW YORK (--) (AP) (--) Some people driven by obsessions and compulsions such as excessive hand washing got significant relief when treated over the phone by a computer that said such things as: ``Is cleaning or washing a major problem for you? If yes, press 1. If no, press 2.''<ep>
   The computer, along with a written manual, helped the patients plan exercises that taught them to control their urges, researcher Dr. John Greist said.<ep>
   This behavior-modifying strategy has been shown to be effective, but it's not widely offered by human therapists, Greist said. The high-tech approach, in contrast, can be available anywhere there is a push-button phone.<ep>
   Greist, a psychiatrist at the Dean Foundation in Madison, Wis., presented the results of his technique Wednesday at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.<ep>
   An estimated five million Americans have obsessive-compulsive disorder, marked by unwanted, anxiety-provoking thoughts, usually with ritual behavior to relieve the anxiety. The rituals can occupy several hours a day, interfering with normal life.<ep>
   Common obsessions include fears of being contaminated, harming another person or making a mistake. Common rituals include hand washing, checking locks and arranging objects in a precise order. People with the disorder understand that the rituals are foolish but can't avoid them.<ep>
   For the study, researchers programmed a computer to react to information patients entered with a push-button phone, and to talk back with more than 700 taped messages. Patients, who were diagnosed and referred to the program by a mental health professional, also used a printed workbook.<ep>
   Forty patients participated in the 12-week study. Of the 17 who completed two or more exercises, 75 percent reported that they were much improved or very much improved.<ep>
