<m1>   <m0>Fitness guru Richard Simmons, 47, sat perched at the island counter in his big, cozy kitchen, where he shared his low-fat cookies, his love for his four Dalmatians (--) ``They become your children, and it's so hard because you're never supposed to give dogs table food'' (--) and his passion for food. ``I'm an ex-fatty who still thinks like a fatty but doesn't look like one anymore.''<ep>
   <m0>Q.<m0> Just how much do you love food?<ep>
   <m0>A.<m0> I am a compulsive eater, and I always will be. I sold pralines (--) those luscious New Orleans delicacies (--) on the street corner when I was 7. I was raised in the middle of all these unbelievable restaurants. I will always love anything fried. I'm talking about cement from a bench deep-fried (--) I would eat that. I can eat breakfast at 7 and eat another complete breakfast at 8. It's because I just adore food. I'll always love fried chicken, biscuits and gravy. I was raised that way. It was God, family and food was third. My love for food led to obesity, which led to eating disorders.<ep>
   <m0>Q.<m0> A day never goes by that you don't exercise?<ep>
   <m0>A.<m0> Never. Today, I'll do three hours of exercise.<ep>
   <m0>Q.<m0> What's the minimum you'll work out?<ep>
   <m0>A.<m0> An hour every day, and I have to do it in the morning. I've got to get out of bed at 4:30, get on the floor and do my sit-ups. Afterward, I do my stretching, and then I have to get down and do as many push-ups as I can (--) and I hate those push-ups (--) and I have to stretch my legs. I do it all to music.<ep>
   <m0>Q.<m0> What are your meals like when you stick to a diet?<ep>
   <m0>A.<m0> Breakfast, I'll have a bagel with fat-free cream cheese, and I go for fruit instead of juice. I'll peel an orange or grapefruit. And vitamins and a couple of large glasses of water. And I try not to eat between meals. When I'm home I open the fridge 20 times during the day (--) bong, bong, Tupperware tops will be popping up (--) just for viewing like a museum. And dinner: breast of chicken, a baked potato and vegetables. Whether I'm home or when I travel, I can always order a big salad with oil and vinegar on the side. I don't even look at the menu. I just know every place is going to have salad or chicken. I eat red meat once a week, and I watch the portions. Every Saturday night, I have dessert, which could be pecan pie if I'm in the South or cheesecake in New York.<ep>
   <m0>Q.<m0> So you don't have to give up your passion for food?<ep>
   <m0>A.<m0> Yeah. There's some people who grow their own tofu and sprouts. I'm not that kind of person. You know, I got on a plane, and there was a fitness celebrity. Seven-thirty in the morning, and she was eating a cold yam wrapped in tinfoil. And I said to myself, ``I could just never do <m0>that.''<m0><ql>
