<m4> TEXT DIVIDED INTO 2 LEG(S) (--)(--) LEG MEASURE SET TO  11p1 <m2><ql>
<m4> BEGIN LEG #1 <m1>   <m0>(box) New drug for Kaposi's sarcoma: <m0>The Food and Drug Administration approved a drug last week made of microscopic fat bubbles to treat Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that strikes mostly AIDS patients.<ep>
   Studies show DaunoXome is as effective as the current three-drug treatment for Kaposi's but causes fewer side effects, said manufacturer NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of Boulder, Colo.<ep>
  DaunoXome is an example of liposomal drugs, where microscopic fat bubbles are used to coat highly toxic medicines. Scientists believe the fat coating allows the drugs to travel to the illness without leaking into other cells. NeXstar did not disclose a price for DaunoXome.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Hodgkin's risks: <m0>The treatments that can cure Hodgkin's disease in children can create a greater likelihood of developing a second cancer later in life. Radiation and chemotherapy are probably responsible for the 18-fold risk of leukemia among Hodgkin's survivors. In a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, 15 medical centers <m4> BEGIN LEG #2 <m0>followed 1,380 young Hodgkin's survivors for about 11 1/2 years. Statistically, 4.4 cancers would have been expected to occur; in fact, there were 88 second cancers. Women developed breast cancer at a rate 75 times greater than expected, amounting to a 35 percent chance of getting breast cancer by age 40.<ep>
   But far fewer patients died of the second cancers than would have if they had not been treated aggressively for Hodgkin's.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Drink your milk:<m0> Women, drinking a few extra glasses of milk during pregnancy may significantly reduce the risk of a disease that causes premature birth and even death of the mother or fetus. In an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, a group of Canadian researchers found that pregnant women who received 1,500- to 2,000-milligram calcium supplements showed a 62 percent reduction in the risk of getting preeclampsia, a disease of late pregnancy that affects about 7 percent of pregnant women.<ep>
