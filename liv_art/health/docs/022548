<m0>uild your healthy eating plan on a base of grain foods that reaches beyond bagels, pretzels, pasta and popcorn. Variety is the No. 1 ingredient in your recipe for good health, according to the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans.<ep>
   So stretch a little. Experiment. Try something new. Or something old, like barley, which has been around since 7000 B.C. In fact, remains have been found of Stone Age cakes made of barley and wheat.<ep>

<m0>   Barley is a grain whose kernel is captured in a tough hull. When the barley kernel is ``pearled,'' the hull is removed and the kernel is polished. Despite that processing, regular pearled barley takes 45 minutes to cook, probably too long on a busy work night. But that problem can be solved.<ep>
   Quick-cooking barley, ready in 12 minutes, is available in some grocery stores. But healthy eaters who are mildly organized can cook regular pearled barley while eating dinner one night, for quick reheating the next night.<ep>
   Barley is a good source of complex carbohydrates, and provides soluble fiber shown to lower cholesterol and reduce heart disease risks.<ep>
   Barley protein goes well with garbanzo beans or lentils for a fat-free, cholesterol-free protein that's as complete as meat.<ep>
   The National Barley Foods Council offers these quick-fix suggestions for adding variety and a nutritional boost to your evening meals:<ep>
   <m0>(box) Add one cup <m0>of cooked pearl barley to a package of fresh or frozen stir-fry vegetables or chow mein. For added crunch, toss in a few cashews or sliced water chestnuts.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Stretch your favorite <m0>meatloaf recipe with a cup of cooked pearl barley. Barley adds much-needed moisture and improves the texture of turkey burgers, too.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Make a good canned soup <m0>better by adding a cup of cooked pearl barley. <ep>
   <m0>(box) For a quick and hardy <m0>side dish, cook a package of frozen mixed vegetables according to package directions. Add a cup of cooked pearl barley and season with fresh or dried herbs and a light drizzle of olive oil. Serve hot.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Create a savory pot <m0>of ``almost homemade'' beans by adding a cup of cooked pearl barley to a large can of prepared pork and beans. Stir in 2 tablespoons molasses, 1 tablespoon prepared mustard and chopped fresh onion. Bake in a 350-degree oven for one hour.<ep>
   <m0>(box) For a quick, <m0>whole-meal salad, toss a cup of cooked pearl barley with 1 1/2 cups cooked and cubed chicken or turkey, 1 cup halved green grapes and 1/2 cup each of sliced celery and water chestnuts. Dress with your favorite low-fat salad dressing and garnish with toasted sliced almonds.<ep>
   <m0>(box) For another quick, <m0>high-fiber salad treat, add a cup of cooked pearl barley to fruited cabbage slaw. Or stir a cup of cooked barley into deli carrot raisin salad.<ql>
