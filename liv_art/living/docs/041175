<m0>   ATLANTA (--) (AP) (--) The first survey of arthritis sufferers by race in the United States found the lowest reported rate among Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent.<ep>
   Researchers don't quite know why, though Dr. Charles Helmick, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, attributed it to a general reluctance to admit symptoms, less obesity and genetic factors.<ep>
   ``We have a lot of questions,'' he said Thursday. ``Arthritis is relatively understudied. Not only is the whole population affected, but every group has it as one of their top four conditions.''<ep>
   The rate among whites, blacks, American Indians and Alaska natives was 15 percent to 16 percent for each group, the CDC said. But only about 7 percent of Asian-Pacific Islanders and 11 percent of Hispanics reported symptoms.<ep>
   No attempt was made to break down earlier surveys by race, the Arthritis Foundation said.<ep>
   The figures, taken from the National Health Interview Survey conducted from 1989 to 1991, are the latest available.<ep>
   Arthritis afflicts about 40 million Americans and the number is likely to grow rapidly as the baby boom generation ages, reaching 60 million in 2020, Helmick said.<ep>
   The best protection against arthritis is to keep weight down, avoid joint injuries and seek prompt treatment when injuries occur. While some kinds of exercise can cause problems with joints, walking can benefit almost everybody, Helmick said.<ep>
   ``We tell people to get out and do something,'' he said.<ep>
