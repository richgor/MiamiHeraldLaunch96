<m0>   A widely used blood test for prostate cancer can give false positive results if the man being tested has ejaculated within the two days preceding the test, according to a new report.<ep>
   False alarms on the test, called the prostate specific antigen or PSA test, may be causing unnecessary and expensive follow-up procedures, the report concludes.<ep>
   ``We would recommend on the basis of this study that men abstain from ejaculation for 48 hours before getting a PSA test,'' said Joseph E. Oesterling, chief of urology and director of the Michigan Prostate Institute at the University of Michigan. Oesterling led the study, which appeared in the journal Urology.<ep>
   Elevated PSA values (--) generally 4.0 or higher (--) can indicate a prostate tumor. To confirm the diagnosis, doctors may perform a sonogram and needle biopsies, which can cost more than $1,000.<ep>
   Oesterling and his colleagues measured blood PSA levels in 64 men, age 49 to 79, before the men ejaculated and at several intervals up to two days. In 56 men, PSA levels increased significantly after ejaculation and remained elevated for at least six hours. The average increase was 0.8, or 41 percent above the average starting level (--) a rise big enough to push levels for about 15 percent of men above 4.0. In all but two of the men, levels returned to normal after 48 hours.<ep>
