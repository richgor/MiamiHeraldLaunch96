<m0>   If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then My Twinn, a company that makes dolls in the image of real-life girls, is on to something big.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,2<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   For $130 (--) more if you want matching play outfits, party dresses and beauty accessories (--) the dollmaker based in Littleton, Colo., will produce a 23-inch clone of your child.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,2<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   Working from photographs and personal profiles, My Twinn matches facial shape, skin tone and eyes. Distinguishing features like moles and wayward freckles are added, then the doll's hair is cut, styled and blown dry.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,2<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   My Twinn, which has sold the dolls nationally for two years, designed them primarily for girls 3 to 12. A version for boys will be available in the fall.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,2<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   There's also a line for moms called ``When She Was Young'' that immortalizes mothers in their preteen years. Those dolls are often ordered with a special stand because, as company spokesman Dave Liggett explains, ``If you're getting one for your mother, she's probably going to display it, not play with it.''<ep>
<m1><styl>vs,3<ql>
<m0>   My Twinn can be reached at (800) 469-8946. The company's mailing address is 8000 S. Lincoln St., Littleton, Colo., 80122. The company's homepage on the Internet is: <m0>http://www.mytwinn.com<ep>
