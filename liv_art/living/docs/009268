<m0> Most of us complain about where we live. Suburbs sprawl, downtowns decay, a sense of community is lost. Today, a few people are trying to build something completely different: <m1> <m0>utopia. This story is the second in a three-part series about communities that challenge the way the rest of us live.<ql>

<m0>p out of Phoenix the tourists come, careening rental cars on the desert highway, past the outer rings of suburbia, past the subdivisions and car lots and fast-food drive-thrus, until finally the landscape is nothing but blazing expanses of saguaro cacti, red rock ledges and dry river beds.<ep>
   They're headed for Arcosanti, an urban experiment that guidebooks describe as ``a post-apocalypse city'' and ``a futuristic vision.'' The brief descriptions set the tourists in a state of high anticipation (--) for who has not wondered if there is a better way? (--) but hardly prepare them for what follows.<ep>
   It's an hour ride until the Arcosanti exit pops into view, the cars shimmy over a bumpy dirt road, and the tires crackle to a stop. The visitors step dazed and dead-legged into<m0> . . . terra incognita<m0>.<ep>
<m0>   Looks like ancient ruins<ep>
<m0>    What they find is a clump of odd concrete buildings, with circular windows, half domes and decorations as primitive as cave scrawlings, that looks at first like the ruins of some ancient desert tribe.<ep>
   But the visitors also spot a few scruffy people (--) beards, jeans, boots (--) shuffling between buildings, tinkering in a metal foundry, improvising with solar engineering; and so in fact, Arcosanti is alive, and in its half-modern-half-Stone-Age aura it could double as one of the cities from the Mad Max movies.<ep>
   What is strangest about Arcosanti, however, and what undoubtedly limits its success as a tourist attraction, is that the 25-year-old community is founded on a critical premise: that the American dream, the national ideal of a big house on a big lot, is gobbling up natural habitat and leading us to ecological catastrophe. It's a small world after all.<ep>
<m0>   Density of New York City<ep>
<m0>   Now home to about 50 people, mainly young single men, Arcosanti is envisioned as the antithesis of suburban sprawl. Very, <m0>very<m0> slowly (--) because they are always strapped for cash (--) the residents are building a hyper-dense cluster of energy-efficient towers, a village for 7,000 people fitting on just 20 acres. The population density would approach that of New York. By limiting the human habitat (--) the city grows up, not out (--) thousands of desert acres around the town can be preserved.<ep>
   ``Suburbia can't keep on spreading out over the planet,'' a bearded Arcosanti guide assures the arriving tourists. ``We just <m0>can't<m0> afford to do that.''<ep>
   The $5 tour also reveals that the 50 or more year-round resi<m2><ql>

UTOPIA,  FROM  1G<ql>
<m0>dents of Arcosanti do have electricity and running water; that the community's principal income comes from the manufacture and sale of bronze and ceramic wind bells; and that the compound includes a bakery (cookies and breads for sale), a cafeteria, an amphitheater, a bunkhouse, a scattering of small apartments, a foundry, a wood shop, a library and a swimming pool.<ep>
   At first, it's hard to tell just what the visitors make of the community's environmental philosophy. But by the end of the tour, when the guide starts in again on the ravages of city sprawl, some of the tourists have begun to nod in agreement. For the tourists, of course, understood the ravages of growth even before their arrival (--) who has not seen a cherished field or woods paved over? Who loves <m1> <m0>characterless sprawl or brown smog?<ep>
   Touched by the Arcosantians' naked idealism, the tourists begin to gaze in new admiration at the strange compound: its ingenious solar engineering, its enthusiastic residents, its stunning views of the high desert and the backdrop of chocolate hills.<ep>
<m0>The big question<ep>
<m0>   Eventually, they must ask themselves: Could I live here?<ep>
   Here emerges the tragic flaw of Arcosanti. For almost every one of the tourists eventually answers: no. Though thousands of tourists have traipsed through the compound since it began in 1970, only a small handful have come back to live and help build the dream. Donations are scarce.<ep>
   As a result, 25 years after its founding, construction of the master plan is only 3 percent complete. The community's founder, designer and leader (--) its guru (--) Paolo Soleri, is now 76. He has been at it long enough to have buried his wife and co-founder, Colly, on the site. Moreover, while some critics rave (--) <m1> <m0>Newsweek said, ``As urban architecture, Arcosanti is probably the most important experiment undertaken in our lifetime'' (--) its example has not inspired a single copy anywhere else.<ep>
   Maybe it's because the living conditions are too Spartan, or because the pay is meager, or the location too remote. (Soleri believes that a site closer to Phoenix would have suited the project better, but he could not afford that.) Whatever the reason, Arcosanti has not thrived.<ep>
   ``If you listen to politicians, you listen to academia, you listen to the industrialists, nobody, <m0>nobody<m0>, even begins to think of this idea,'' says Soleri.<ep>
<m0>Simple man, philosophy<ep>
<m0>   The founder and philosopher is a slight man, dressed in a beige sweater, khakis and sneakers. He speaks in a light Italian accent. He can foretell planetary catastrophe in placid tones, his thick antennalike eyebrows pulled down low on his brow.<ep>
   ``It's really very simple,'' Soleri says. ``We cannot go on like this.''<ep>
   The idea for Arcosanti was conceived during the 1960s, when Paolo was in his 40s, living with Colly near Scottsdale, Ariz., and earning a living with the bells he designed. For $340,000, they bought 860 acres for the community (--) only 20 of which will be developed.<ep>
   Colly was an American; Paolo, an Italian who had come to Arizona to study with Frank Lloyd Wright.<ep>
   Soleri describes his time with the famed architect (--) 18 months (--) as ``a wonderful experience,'' but the city that since has become Soleri's life work is an explicit rejection of the master's ideas. Wright spent decades planning a place he called Broadacre City, a metropolis more sprawling than anything ever built. Every imaginary family in Broadacre lived in its own house on at least an acre. Intentionally, it had no center. The automobile reigned.<ep>
   ``The sin of Wright was to glamorize suburbia, to make it seem splendid,'' Soleri says today. ``We are still faced with this dilemma: To fulfill this American dream for everyone, we would run out of space. We would need at least <m0>20 <m0>planets.''<ep>
   In his view, the appeal of suburbia is fraught with internal contradiction.<ep>
   ``People say they love nature; so they buy houses away from the city and out in nature; then the nature disappears,'' he says. ``It becomes . . . just suburbia. That is the dilemma.''<ep>
  Arcosanti, and the other cities Soleri has designed (but not built), resolve the dilemma by restricting the horizontal spread of human habitat, usually by favoring high-rises. (To date, however, the tallest building in Arcosanti rises only four stories.)<ep>
   He believes that the skyscrapers he has designed would avoid the ills associated with ``Manhattanization.'' Rather than the customary fortress mentality, he says, his skyscrapers would be more inviting, more open, with private spaces ringed around public ones.<ep>
   In extolling his hyper-dense prescription for cities, Soleri calls attention time and again to the wonders of nature, noting, for example, that while a Boeing 747 is indeed a complex machine, a canary is infinitely more intricate and worthy of respect. He bases his two central design principles (--) complexity and miniaturization (--) on his observations about organisms.<ep>
<m0>Must waste less<ep>
<m0>   He believes <m1> <m0>a city should be as efficient as an organism and that to be so, people must find fulfillment in less wasteful lives. He extols frugality and frowns on the ``hyper-consumptive'' nature of American society. Big houses, he says, are just ``bigger containers for things,'' and merely accelerate consumerism.<ep>
   ``Everywhere is this idea of hedonism (--) that life must be fun, otherwise it's not acceptable,'' he says. ``Well, fun, sure, it's good for weekends, but fun is not the gist of life.''<ep>
   As it happens, residents of Arcosanti <m0>do <m0>practice what he preaches: There are few apparent signs of hedonism. Wages are close to the national minimum. Rent runs $25 a week. Living quarters are cramped. Some live in concrete cubes measuring 8 feet a side. There is no central heating or air-conditioning. In winter, though space heaters, solar gadgetry and wood stoves help, many residents wear jackets inside the bedrooms and common areas. In summer, rooms stay relatively comfortable.<ep>
   Most of the people it attracts are men, typically in their 20s and 30s. Many have training in architecture. Two households have children.<ep>
   While long hair and beards reflect Arcosanti's '60s genesis, the residents are difficult to peg: While some are vegetarian, some could not live without an occasional cheeseburger. While some brew tea from rosemary bushes, others prefer to make their own beer.<ep>
<m0>Back again<ep>
<m0>   ``It was cool to grow up here,'' says Travis Keena, 19, who lived with his mother at Arcosanti in the early '80s. In November, he came back again to live and work. ``Everyone would look out for me. I've also lived in the normal part of the U.S.A. It's wild having lived in both places.''<ep>
   Mike Ballin, 37, an architecture student from Wisconsin, has lived at Arcosanti three times.<ep>
   ``You think about it, the world's getting more populated all the time, right?'' he says. ``This could be a real solution.''<ep>
   What about the circumstances?<ep>
   ``I'm from a large family so I'm used to it.''<ep>
   Sara Richardson, 23, was living in Phoenix last summer when she heard about Arcosanti on the Discovery Channel. She was looking for work in an architect's office, having just graduated from Louisiana State University.<ep>
   ``There's not many offices where I could draw a concrete section, then walk 50 feet and pour it,'' she says. ``I realized my education was lacking the hands-on element.''<ep>
   Almost all of the residents started at Arcosanti as ``workshoppers,'' people who pay $700 for a five-week introduction to the community. For four of the five weeks, the workshoppers help build or maintain the buildings. Promising workshoppers are recruited to stay full-time.<ep>
<m1><styl>mugr<ql>
Warren<ue5><ql>
<m0>   ``Sometimes I wonder whether I have been duped,'' admits William Warren, 35, who wound up at Arcosanti after the antique business he was working for closed and he split with his girlfriend. ``He <m0>is <m0>Italian and the obvious comparison is to Machiavelli: Here he's got all these middle-class college students building <m4>Warren<m2><ql>
<m0>him his own passive-solar castle. Still . . . I'm here because I think he has a point.''<ep>
   The slow pace of building frustrates everyone, including Soleri. Ask him about his creation and he is prone to rueful humor. Ask, for example, what he thinks will happen to Arcosanti.<ep>
   ``It will probably make a nice ruin, 500 years from now,'' he says. Then, to make sure there are no misunderstandings: ``I'm kidding.''<ep>
   It may be impossible to say just what has sustained this extreme vision for 25 years in the middle of nowhere.<ep>
  But whatever the case, the possibilities of the future keep the tourists coming. They arrive in clusters of five and 10, hour by hour, buying bells, eating cookies and looking around (--) and wondering. If nothing else, Arcosanti appeals to the still, small voice of idealism.<ep>
