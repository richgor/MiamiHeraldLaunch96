   Blue Monday?<P>

 Not when it's time for the annual maitre d's ball. Festivities traditionally are held on Monday because in days gone by, restaurants closed that day, and maitre d's had a chance to party themselves.<P>

 About 500 guests in the restaurant business and some who just wanted to celebrate gathered at Pier 66 for the $100-per-plate black tie bash. Honorary chairman Larry Maturi, who's been involved with the ball practically forever, and community volunteer Audrey Burch greeted guests at the door. The party raised about $30,000 for the I. Lorraine Thomas Children's Emergency Home and Family Support Center.<BR>
 In today's unpredictable work environment, ``entrepreneur'' is an important buzzword. Three of South Florida's best shared their success stories April 25 as they were inducted into Nova Southeastern University's Entrepreneur Hall of Fame. This year's honorees: Shipping magnate Hans Hvide, motivational speaker Kay Smith and book publisher Frederick Ruffner. About 475 business and community leaders congratulated them during a reception at Marriott's Harbor Beach Resort.<BR>
General manager Bill Cunningham circulated to keep the party running smoothly. The Doubletree party marked the fifth anniversary of the President's Council, which is composed of executives from 870 community organizations.<BR>
in. In competition, that is, at this year's Doc Art contest at the Museum of Art. Physicians vie for awards in painting, drawing, sculpture, photography and computer art in the contest sponsored by the Broward County Medical Association and Alliance. Tickets were $15; about 200 attended the April 24 reception. The party earned about $2,000 for the museum.<P>

 Comedian Elayne Boosler headlined a benefit for Gilda's Club Saturday at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts. The performance also featured former Saturday Night Live cast member Kevin Nealon. About 400 guests paid $150 per ticket for an opportunity to meet the celebrities at an onstage party afterward. The event earned more than $60,000 for Gilda's Club, named after the late SNL cast member Gilda Radner, which provides support for cancer victims.<BR>
