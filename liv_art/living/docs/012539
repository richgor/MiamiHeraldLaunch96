<m0>lacing a spouse, parent or other family member in a long-term care facility often is as emotionally difficult on the caregiver as it is on the person who is ill.<ep>
 But there comes a time when the caregiver can no longer control the behavior of the loved one suffering from a chronic, degenerative disease. <m1><ep>
<m0> Nevertheless, guilt, ambivalence and grief often accompany the decision to place a loved one in a nursing home.<ep>
 To help with that change, support groups are important, suggests the Family Caregiver Alliance. Such groups can provide information and encouragement concerning:<ep>
 (box) Family and patient rights and how to advocate for them.<ep>
 (box) Methods to ensure ongoing quality care.<ep>
 (box) Interacting with members of the staff at the facility.<ep>
 (box) How to begin to develop a way of life beyond caregiving.<ep>
 That last is important because many caregivers are coping with problems often brought on by <m1> <m0>continuing emotional strain.<ep>
 The stress comes from the difficulty in caring for those with illnesses such as Alzheimer's, 65 percent of the time while the caregiver is holding down a job. More than half <m1> <m0>of the people who were institutionalized suffered from Alzheimer's. <ep>
 Slightly more <m1> <m0>of the patients were women. Seventy-five percent of them were 75 or older and 70 percent of them had incomes of less than $16,000 a year.<ep>
 After a loved one was placed in the <m1> <m0>facility, the former caregiver visited the sick person, on average, three times a week. <ep>
