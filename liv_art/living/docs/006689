<m0>How the game works: <m0>The first role-playing game (RPG) starring Mario, <m0>Legend of the Sevenstars<m0>  includes classic video game characters such as Princess Toadstool, Toad, Yoshi and Bowser, along with characters <m1> <m0>new to the world of Mario. You'll also find similar game play from the<m0> Super Mario World<m0>  and <m0>Super Mario Bros<m0>.  series. Among the new settings: the Mushroom Kingdom, with its town of mining moles, a mysterious forest, giant bean stalk and mushroom townspeople. Also features puzzles, mazes, coins, flowers, mushroom power-ups and stars. Mario gains information by talking with characters he meets. Bonus games include: Beetle Race, Melody Bay and Moleville. Lots of battle options in the Mario tradition, including an attack mode (punching or hitting) and special mode (fireballs, magic spells and secret weapons). Battery-backed memory allows you to save up to four <m1> <m0>games.<ql>

<m0>Good points, bad points: <m0>Mario's introduction into the role-playing genre sets a new standard for 16-bit graphics. For example, a 3-D Mario moves in eight <m1> <m0>directions and can jump up or down, giving him complete motion. Another advantage here: In an RPG game, kids must know how to read. The price is a steep $74.99 but it takes about 100 hours to complete, so at least the game will have some lasting power.<ql>

<m0>Tips: <m0>When Mario gets to a bridge that looks like a giant bolt, he hops up and down so that the bolt revolves on its threads, carrying him to the other side.

<m0>The verdict: <m0>Mario's entry into the RPG realm expands a small, but loyal market.<ql>
