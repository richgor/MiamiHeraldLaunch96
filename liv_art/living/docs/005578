<m0>he people are quacking at each other. <m0>Quacking. <m0>The pot-luck dinner is done, the guests have settled in the living room, and they have begun to quack. Exuberantly, hands-tucked-to-armpits and elbows flapping, an impromptu Donald Duck pantomime.<ep>
   The pot-luckers, 16 of them, are strangers getting to know one another. That's the point of the parlor game and, in fact, the point of the entire Saturday night, because at the end each person must look around and ask: Would these people make good neighbors?<ep>
   This is not the kind of question that home buyers in South Florida generally ask themselves (--) we move in and bolt the door (--) but then the hosts of this suburban Fort Lauderdale dinner party are hoping to build a neighborhood unlike anything ever built here.<ep>
   They want to build a utopian subdivision.<ep>
   As members picture it, this will be a neighborhood designed by and for the people, a place where, as at the Cheers bar, everyone knows your name; where parents feel secure enough to let children roam free; where households plug into solar power and irrigate with reused water; and most intriguingly, where households share cooking, dining <m0>en masse  <m0>three or four nights a week in a common dining room.<ep>
   Three Broward County couples embarked on this quest two years ago, running pot-lucks and seminars to recruit other families, and already they own a piece of land, a small parcel in western <m1> <m0>Delray Beach. There, they tell people, they will build from scratch a neighborhood consisting of a community living and dining hall and about 20 homes ranging in cost from $85,000 to $185,000. They are meeting with architects next week to start sketches.<ep>
   ``We looked around at what was out there and decided to build our own neighborhood,'' said group member Corey Yugler, 36, of Dania, a script supervisor for movies and commercials. ``People today have to hustle, hustle, hustle just to make a living (--) so much so that they don't have time for anything or anyone else. People are beat. But some people are beginning to ask themselves: Shouldn't we expect something more of our communities?''<ep>
   The efforts of the group, which calls itself Synergy Co-housing, fit neatly within the nascent national yearning for a sense of community.<ep>
   This movement began in earnest in the '80s, marked by the publication of such books as <m0>Habits of the Heart<m0>, which suggested that the American romance with the rugged individual should be tempered by an appreciation of community. At the same time, many architects, led by Miami's Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and Andres Duany, have aimed to create a sense of community by replacing walled subdivisions with neotraditional towns.<ep>
<m0>A broader audience<ql>
<m0>   Today, the same message reaches a broader audience. Most recently, Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the now-familiar rallying cry for community in her campaign for children, entitling her new book <m0>It Takes a Village<m0>, from the African proverb ``It takes a village to raise a child.''<ep>
   ``So alienated do we feel from the larger society at times that we cannot imagine the village existing in any form anymore,'' she wrote. ``Where we used to chat with neighbors on stoops and porches, now we watch videos in our darkened living rooms. Instead of strolling down Main Street, we spend hours in automobiles and at anonymous shopping malls.''<ep>
   In this search for community, several dozen ``co-housing'' initiatives have sprung up in the United States over the last decade, borrowing ideas fashioned first during the '70s in Denmark. Co-housing communities have been built in Washington, California, New York, Massachusetts and Colorado.<ep>
<m0>Typical suburbanites<ql>
<m0>   The three leading couples of the Delray project (--) Chris and Christine, Gary and Corey, Mike and Sari (--) seem like many others in suburbia. They are not hippies. They're married, own homes and cars. One couple has kids. They hold college degrees, pursue careers. Their ages range from 30 to 60, and they are too different to categorize simply:<ep>
   (box) Chris Hoskin, 30, a scrap-metal dealer and motorcycle enthusiast, and Christine Hoskin, 30, an office administrator and literacy volunteer.<ep>
   (box) Gary Shlifer, 36, a commercial cinematographer, and Corey Yugler, 36, a script supervisor (they met on the set of <m0>Cape Fear).<m0><ep>
   (box) Mike Winston, 59, a financial consultant, Infiniti driver and fan of the Miami Hurricanes; and Sari Winston, 54, a social worker who has worked with neglected children.<ep>
   In person, they hardly seem like visionaries. They explain their attraction to co-housing not with revolutionary notions but as practical matters:<ep>
   The communal meals, beyond allowing neighbors to know one another, will save time for hectic working couples; the community will share child-care needs and expenses; the cohesiveness of the neighborhood will discourage crime.<ep>
<m0>Just common sense<ql>
<m0>   ``Basically, we can talk and talk and talk about the philosophy of this movement,'' Christine Hoskin said. ``But really, it just makes common sense.''<ep>
   Adds her husband, Chris: ``You know, when Christine is out of town for work, there's a lot of nights when I have crackers and cheese and a beer for dinner. I really won't mind having a place where I could get a home-cooked meal.''<ep>
   Sometimes, however, co-housing discussions assume more earnest tones, as when members and prospective members come together for meetings. The prospective members arrive having heard about the group from friends, newspapers or fliers at libraries and places like Bread of Life health-food store or the Yoga College of India.<ep>
   Talk at the pot-luck dinner, for example, begins with an introductory go-round where members and guests introduce themselves and are asked to share ``some recent insight about your life.''<ep>
   ``One of the things we do at co-housing meetings,'' Corey Yugler tells the circled guests, ``is introduce ourselves. Because part of what co-housing is about is knowing your neighbor. At first it's kind of awkward to say, `Hi, I'm so-and-so,' unless you do a lot of 12-step meetings or therapy things. But let's try it.''<ep>
<m0>Sharing thoughts<ql>
<m0>   No ones cries, no one confesses to unspeakable passions, but one woman tells the group that she recently had ``a huge, huge fight'' with her husband, and enthuses about how rewarding it was to have a friend (--) one from the group (--) to discuss it with. Another man tells the group he has been too busy the past week for any insight.<ep>
   In recent months, as the group has been recruiting members, residents of the subdivision abutting their Delray Beach property have been worrying privately that the co-housing project is, well, a <m0>commune.<m0><ep>
   ``We've heard rumors,'' said one retiree, whose new Mediterranean home backs up to the site. ``Don't they have to take turns cooking? That doesn't sound like a normal community to me. It sounds like a commune.''<ep>
   His wife continued: ``With a commune, you don't know if you are getting a wacko situation or whatever. The whole thing sounds a little cultish.''<ep>
   Indeed, the most frequently asked question is: Is this a commune?<ep>
<m0>Like a condominium<ql>
<m0>   It isn't. Legally, the community will be set up like a condominium. Homes will be individually owned, and the common building (--) consisting of a communal dining room, kitchen, mailboxes and a children's play area (--) will belong to the community. Philosophically, the group will share only the belief that the community can serve as a bastion against the chaos of the times.<ep>
   ``There's no wife-swapping, either,'' Yugler cracked.<ep>
   The common house is the center of co-housing life, and it's designed to be a busy place.<ep>
   Unlike the sterile common rooms in most condo arrangements, the co-housing common houses are decorated to provide all the homey comforts of private living and dining rooms.<ep>
   Moreover, in a typical co-housing design, the layout funnels activity into the common house. Getting from the community parking lot to your home, for example, will require walking through it. Your mailbox is there, anyway, and often so is a library. Most evenings, the members responsible for the group meal will be cooking in its big kitchen. In addition, community meetings are held at the common house (--) and co-housing produces lots of meetings, covering everything from lawn care to local zoning.<ep>
<m0>Other questions<ql>
<m0>   Aside from the commune issue, questions also revolve around the communal meals: Isn't it a hassle to cook for 50? What about privacy? What if I want to eat alone?<ep>
   In other co-housing communities, people are responsible for cooking once a month for the group. Typically, two people share the duty. The cost of groceries is divided among those who eat that night, usually about $3 for an adult. There are several tables in the dining room, allowing families to break off to themselves. Moreover, attendance is neither mandatory nor necessary; each home will have its own kitchen and dining room.<ep>
   ``Every once in a while, the last thing I will want to do in the evening is talk to anyone (--) I'll want to crawl in a hole,'' Yugler said. ``In that case, the common meal will be there if I want, and if not, that's fine, too.''<ep>
   The biggest challenge facing the group now is attracting members willing to take the financial plunge. While there is a contingent of about 15 households who attend meetings and have put up $250 to attend next week's design session with the architects, only the three founding couples have signed up to invest fully. Undaunted, members believe the project will draw more residents once the architects produce sketches and price tags.<ep>
   ``People want to see what they're getting and exactly how much it will cost them,'' Chris Hoskin said.<ep>
   To be sure, if there is one quality that distinguishes group members so far, it's a willingness to take a chance, to cooperate, to assume a new stance. And through it all, they evince unabashed enthusiasm. Just listen to them quack.<ql>
