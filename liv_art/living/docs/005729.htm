   The National Cancer Institute plans to reconsider its controversial stand against routine screening for breast cancer for women under 50, after a new international analysis produced compelling evidence that the screening saves lives.<P>

   The yet-unpublished new report, by Swedish researchers who analyzed earlier studies involving more than 150,000 women, found a 24 percent lower death rate among women who got mammograms beginning in their 40s.<P>

   ``It was a little bit of a surprise to people that as much as a 24 percent decrease in mortality was demonstrated,'' said Dr. Laszlo Tabar, director of mammography at Falun Central Hospital in Sweden, who presented the analysis several weeks ago to 210 scientists from 16 countries, including the United States.<P>

   ``Breast cancer is not forgiving in the age group of 40 to 49,'' Tabar said, with the latest results suggesting that breast cancer in younger women is a faster-spreading disease than in older ones. ``If you miss once, there's not another chance.''<P>

   Debate over the usefulness of regular mammograms for women in their 40s has intensified since the NCI concluded three years ago that there was insufficient scientific evidence to justify such screening. Proponents of screening younger women point to lives that have been saved, while opponents cite the difficulty of interpreting X-rays of younger, denser breast tissue.<P>

   Everyone agrees that annual mammograms clearly benefit women 50 and older.<P>

   New guidelines likely<P>

   Spurred by the new analysis, the federal agency will convene a conference of specialists this fall to review the data from Sweden and other evidence. It's likely to issue a new set of recommendations.<P>

   ``The statement might conclude that with the advent of new information, there is additional evidence which shows a beneficial impact of screening women in their 40s,'' said Dr. Barry Kramer, associate director of NCI's early detection and community oncology program. ``Or it might conclude that the balance of evidence still leaves in question the definitive answer, or it might be anything in between.''<P>

   Based on the same new data, meanwhile, the American College of Radiology and the American Cancer Society may strengthen their own guidelines for women in their 40s, recommending mammograms yearly instead of every one to two years. Both organizations have been severely critical of NCI for not supporting routine screening for women in the 40-to-50 age group.<P>

   Proper training needed<P>

   While Tabar said the new findings suggest a benefit from annual mammograms for women in their 40s, he cautioned against younger women going every year to get screened at just any breast imaging center or gynecologist's office because they may not all be equipped to interpret the results.<P>

   Because of the greater difficulty of reading mammograms in younger women, Tabor said, ``I'm not going to scream, `All right, everybody screen women from ages 40 to 49.' This calls for well-trained people who have tremendous quality control.''<P>

   Poorly done mammography can lead to a high percentage of unnecessary biopsies or missed tumors, he noted.<P>

   In 1993, the NCI came under fierce criticism for reversing a 1989 guideline that recommended mammography and clinical breast examination every one to two years for women 40 to 49 years old. That's the recommendation still endorsed by the American Cancer Society and the American College of Radiology, although both groups are now considering changing the recommendation to once every year.<P>

   Strong critic<P>

   One of NCI's strongest critics has been Dr. Daniel B. Kopans, director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital.<P>

   ``We argued with NCI not to change the screening guidelines when they did it. It was inappropriate analysis,'' said Kopans.<P>

   The latest ``meta-analysis'' by Tabar and colleagues of several studies from around the world, involving women who were followed for an average of 11 years, ``just now confirms a mistake was made then,'' Kopans said.<P>

   He said he believes the NCI changed its stance in 1993 because of concerns over how much it would cost to continue regular mammograms for younger women and because of politics. The NCI's position agreed with the Clinton administration's health-care reform plan unveiled a few months later, which called for covering mammograms only for women 50 and older.<P>

   Kramer disputed that, saying the agency's 1993 meeting to review the scientific evidence for mammography in younger women was held only days after Bill Clinton was inaugurated, months before the health-reform proposal was unveiled.<P>

   He added that the 1993 NCI statement didn't specifically recommend against mammography for younger women, but said only that there is scientific disagreement over the benefits for the 40-to-49 age group.<P>

   The Swedish meta-analysis included 150,000 women in studies done in the United States, Sweden and Scotland, but not a Canadian trial that has been criticized for poor quality mammography. If the Canadian trial were included, there would still be a statistically significant reduction in the death rate of 17 percent among younger women who were screened.
