<m0>Allen Morris, a courtly Miami businessman with a Georgia drawl, isn't in the habit of approaching strangers in hotel lobbies.<ep>
   But Bill Bright and his wife <m1> <m0>Vonette, visiting the Fontainebleau one day in 1960, looked so happy that Morris introduced himself on a whim (--) and met lifelong friends.<ep>
   ``I never did that before or since,'' said Morris, now 82. ``I think the Lord had something to do with it.''<ep>
   Today, Bright, the founder of Campus Crusade for Christ, will receive nearly $1.1 million and the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion during a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace in London.<ep>
   The honor (--) which carries a purse larger than any other award, including the Nobel Prize (--) is bestowed each year to someone who has shown great originality in advancing humankind's understanding of God or spirituality. Bright's contribution: building Campus Crusade for Christ into the largest evangelical organization in the United States.<ep>
   Morris nominated his old friend for the Templeton, but says, <m1> <m0>``I don't take any credit for this at all.'' <ep>
   Neither does Bright, who makes his world headquarters in Orlando, but travels 300 days a year spreading the Gospel.<ep>

<m0>   ``I'm just a puny termite somewhere out in space,'' Bright, 74, said last week. ``Forty-five years ago I became a slave of Jesus. Now here I am the recipient of the most-prized award anyone could receive for any pursuit. That's kind of humorous, isn't it? That a slave would be so honored.''<ep>

CRUSADE,  FROM  1D<ql>
<m0>investor Sir John Templeton in 1972, include Mother Teresa, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, journalist Michael Novak and a college professor named Thomas Torrance, who was honored for attempting to establish evidence of God through scientific reasoning. Bright was selected by an international panel of nine judges, including George Bush.<ep>
   In 1951, Bright and his wife gave up a successful gourmet food company, gave away their possessions and committed their lives to serving God. They founded Campus Crusade for Christ at University of California at Los Angeles. <ep>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ep>
<m0>   Bright is still best known for evangelizing college students. Campus Crusade has staff members assigned to 650 university campuses in the United States, including the University of Miami and Florida International University, and more than 400 overseas.<ep>
   Students have changed dramatically since Bright began sharing the Gospel with them. He said taking public prayers and the Bible out of classrooms, and legalizing abortion, have caused a moral decline in America.<ep>
     ``Today, immorality is just like taking a drink of water,'' Bright said. ``Having sex is not that big a deal anymore. The average student has no norm. What is right, what is wrong. . .People don't know what God's word says about it.''<ep>
    Campus Crusade has changed, too. The organization now has an annual budget exceeding $250 million, 13,000 full-time employees and 101,000 trained volunteers worldwide.<ep>
<m0>Mighty goal<ep>
<m0>   Its goal is nothing less than to preach Christianity to every person on Earth by the year 2,000.<ep>
   To that end, Campus Crusade has spawned dozens of additional ministries, targeting everyone from prisoners to the military. In South Florida alone, the organization has ministries trying to reach students, executives, women, athletes and Latin America.<ep>
    South Florida poses a unique challenge to evangelists. ``It has a secular environment where it's easier to be distracted from the values a person may have had when they were younger,'' said Steve DeBardelaben, who has worked for Campus Crusade ministries in South Florida for 20 years.<ep>
    All Campus Crusade employees, including Bright and his wife (--) who live in a donated condominium and jointly earn <m1> <m0>about $43,000 (--) <m1> <m0>must raise enough money in donations to cover their own salaries.<ep>
   Bright plans to donate his million-dollar-plus award to his latest project, encouraging Christians worldwide to fast and pray.<ep>
   ``Vonette and I love the Lord with all our hearts,'' Bright said. ``She, like myself, would be scared to take one penny for ourselves.''<ep>
   While some other prominent ministries have been rocked by scandals, in 1993 <m1> <m0>Money magazine named Campus Crusade America's most efficient religious organization because the vast majority of contributions actually reach ministry programs.<ep>
   ``I don't know how in the world Bill had enough nerve to start this thing, but it's the most exciting thing I've ever seen,'' Morris said.<ep>
   Bright's approach to winning converts for Christ is simple and direct: Tell the Gospel story and build personal relationships.<ep>
   Although Jesus' first followers included social outcasts, Bright has always targeted the best and the brightest on the theory that they'll go on to successfully evangelize many others.<ep>
<m0>Case in point<ep>
<m0>   Darryl Burgess, 29, grew up in Liberty City, won a college football scholarship to a West Virginia school, then in his senior year was born again through Campus Crusade, he said.<ep>
   He now works for the organization, ministering to UM athletes, who listen to him because he's faced the same pressures they do, he said. He holds Bible studies and breakfasts for students, and tries to become a regular presence in their lives.<ep>
   ``I'm constantly working out with some of the guys,'' Burgess said. ``Guys are calling me up to get together to have lunch to talk about spiritual issues. We meet before or after practice to try to encourage them all through the week. When someone is injured, they've blown out their knee and is having surgery, we go to the hospital and let them know we're praying for them.''<ep>
   Morris's youngest son, W. Allen Morris, 44, a successful real estate magnate like his father, has a very different Campus Crusade ministry in South Florida.<ep>
   At least twice a year, the younger Morris hosts dinner parties for hundreds of executives at plush area hotels and country clubs. A well known, successful speaker (--) typically an athlete or business executive (--) talks of his or her own faith and invites the audience to know Christ.<ep>
<m0>Have needs, too<ep>
<m0>   ``We call them [the audience] the <m0>up-<m0>and-outers,'' said Debbie Petersen, 45, of Coral Gables, who helped with that ministry for several years. ``They still have the same hurts and needs for Christ as everyone else, but nobody targets them. They may look like they've got it all, but they don't know Christ.''<ep>
   People who fill out a card indicating that they want to learn more get a follow-up letter from Morris and a personal visit from someone from Campus Crusade.<ep>
   ``I think we've been successful as an organization because of our sincerity,'' said Morris' father, a Campus Crusade board member for 25 years. ``We don't have any other ulterior motive. We just want to see people come to know the Lord.''<ep>
