<m1> <m0>teacher wrote that a recent column of mine on ``whole language'' omits important information; specifically, that it works when properly taught.<ep>
   In that column, I noted that California's Department of Public Instruction has recanted its embrace of whole language and ordered all state school systems to return to phonics-based reading/language arts instruction.<ep>
   It did so after California fourth-graders came in last in a 1994 national assessment of reading abilities and an in-state study found that by the end of second grade, phonics students scored more than a year above whole language students in word recognition, comprehension, and vocabulary.<ep>
   Whole language was one of many reforms to sweep through public education in the 1980s. Also known as ``literature-based'' instruction, its advocates maintain that the most natural way for children to learn to read and write is through trial-and-error. After all, they reason, children learn to talk without ever being taught formal rules of speech, so the same should apply to learning to read.<ep>
   Keep in mind that when phonics reigned supreme, far fewer children had reading problems than is the case today. In this context, the claims of whole language advocates are just another example of how rhetoric often fails to mirror reality.<ep>
   But don't take my word for it. The November 1995 issue of The Blumenfeld Education Letter contains the full text of a letter <m1> <m0>sent by 40 professors of linguistics and psycholinguistics from Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northeastern University, the University of Massachusetts, Brandeis University and Boston University to the Massachusetts commissioner of education. The professors criticized the state's plan to mandate whole language as the standard for reading instruction.<ep>
    The professors wrote that whole language treats ``the alphabetic nature of our writing system as little more than an accident, when, in fact, it is the most important property of written English (--) a linguistic achievement of historic importance.''<ep>
   Whole language, they say, is based on an ``erroneous view of how human language works, a view that runs counter to most of the major scientific results of more than 100 years of linguistics and psycholinguistics,'' and students taught with whole language are being ``shortchanged.''<ep>
   So, with due respect to well-intentioned educators, <m1> <m0>I think it's safe to say the days of whole language are numbered. One can only hope that the rest of the nation follows California's courageous lead in admitting its error and moving swiftly to correct it.<ep>
