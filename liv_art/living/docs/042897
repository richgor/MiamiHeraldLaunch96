<m0>   Blue Monday?<ep>
 Not when it's time for the annual maitre d's ball. <m1> <m0>Festivities traditionally are held on Monday because in days gone by, restaurants closed that day, and maitre d's had a chance to party themselves.<ep>
 About 500 guests in the restaurant business and some who just wanted to celebrate gathered at Pier 66 for the $100-per-plate black tie bash. Honorary chairman <m0>Larry Maturi, <m0>who's been involved with the ball practically forever, and community volunteer <m0>Audrey Burch <m0>greeted guests at the door. The party raised about $30,000 for the I. Lorraine Thomas Children's Emergency Home and Family Support Center.<ql>
<m1>Success stories<ep>
<m0> In today's unpredictable work environment, ``entrepreneur'' is an important buzzword. Three of South Florida's best shared their success stories April 25 as they were inducted into Nova Southeastern University's Entrepreneur Hall of Fame. This year's honorees: <m1> <m0>Shipping magnate <m0>Hans Hvide, <m0>motivational speaker <m0>Kay Smith <m0>and book publisher <m0>Frederick Ruffner. <m0>About 475 business and community leaders <m1> <m0>congratulated them during a reception at Marriott's Harbor Beach Resort.<ql>
<m1>Community get-together<m1><ep>

<m1><ep>
<m0> Buffet stations offering blackened swordfish, seafood gumbo, duck fajitas, roast pork and conch fritters kept 400 guests foraging happily at a President's Council reception Tuesday at the oceanfront Doubletree Hotel. <m1> <m0>General manager <m0>Bill Cunningham <m0>circulated to keep the party running smoothly. <m1> <m0>The Doubletree party marked the fifth anniversary of the President's Council, which is composed of executives from 870 community organizations.<ql>

<m0>   The doctors were <m0>in.<m0> <m1> <m0>In competition, that is, at this year's Doc Art contest <m1> <m0>at the Museum of Art. <m1> <m0>Physicians vie for awards in painting, drawing, sculpture, photography and computer art in the contest sponsored by the Broward County Medical Association and Alliance. Tickets were $15; about 200 attended the April 24 reception. <m1> <m0>The party earned about $2,000 for the museum.<ep>
<m1>Gilda's friends<m1><ep>
<m2><ql>
<m0> Comedian <m0>Elayne Boosler <m0>headlined a benefit for Gilda's Club Saturday at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts. The performance also featured former <m0>Saturday Night Live <m0>cast member <m0>Kevin Nealon. <m1> <m0>About 400 guests paid $150 per ticket for an opportunity to meet <m1> <m0>the celebrities at an onstage party afterward. <m1> <m0>The event earned more than $60,000 for Gilda's Club, named after the late <m0>SNL <m0>cast member Gilda Radner, which provides support for cancer victims.<ql>
