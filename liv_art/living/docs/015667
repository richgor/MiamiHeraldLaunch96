<m1> <m0>few weeks ago, I wrote about people parking illegally in handicap spots.<ep>
   We touched a chord. Many who wrote were from Broward County, which was one of the earliest places in the country to begin a ``Citizens Patrolling Unit.''<ep>
   As police officer Robert Labelle of Broward wrote, ``I see on a daily basis the abuses of the handicap law.'' Particularly at large shopping malls.<ep>
   Many of you are astounded by the number of young people who drive up in their convertibles, kids in tow, placard in place and hop out to merrily do errands.<ep>
   As previously stated, such parking is not a privilege, but an issue of safety. If I could walk, I would gladly park elsewhere. But, because I am so low to the ground in my wheelchair, I am often below a driver's range of vision.<ep>
   The point is this: If it were safe for persons with disabilities to park elsewhere, we would. Many of you wrote about the doctors who easily dole out prescriptions for handicap placards. Yes, doctors are a little free in doing so, fearing they might lose their patient (--) or friend (--) if they say no. Unfortunately, greed has a louder voice than ethics in this case.<ep>
     Wouldn't it be interesting if one of the patients was a spy for <m0>20/20<m0>? What a great show it would be (--) the doctors being filmed while freely giving away prescriptions for handicap parking placards.<ep>
    Many of you also said there should be stricter enforcement. By whom? Keep in mind that Dade County has more doctors than police. And the police are overwhelmed.<ep>
     We should follow a program run by the Pembroke Pines Police Department. This involves volunteers who work as a ``handicapped parking specialists,'' much like the county's program. One specialist who wrote, Alan Rose, gives away an average two tickets each time he is on patrol.<ep>
       Obviously, these volunteers relieve the police on duty, plus channel any anger in a good way. Volunteers are needed, everywhere and all the time.<ep>
        Like the ``Take Back Our Streets'' movement sweeping the country, it's time we do something about this pervasive malady that is equally sweeping the country.<ep>
   In other words, we need to stop complaining and pointing fingers, and start doing. <ep>
