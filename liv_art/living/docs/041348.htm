p on Madison Avenue, the expensive suits shell out $30,000 for an hour of seminar wisdom from Faith Popcorn.<P>

    After all, it was she who saw a nation hunkering amid sofa cushions and four-head VCRs and pronounced America ``cocooning.'' She who knew before the first top popped that new Coke lacked fizz. She who Fortune magazine dubbed ``the Nostradamus of marketing.''<P>

    But at the moment, on Northwest 187th Avenue in North Miami, she's offering her insights . . . for free.<P>

    Mike Woulfe, a big, burly guy, stands by his big, burly motorcycle, a $15,000 BMW R-1000 RT. While interviewing Popcorn on the Miami stop in a tour for her new book, Clicking, ($26, HarperCollins), Woulfe, news director at WINZ radio, had let on that he sometimes flirts with the notion of getting into the cycle biz.<P>

    So now here's Popcorn pondering the gleaming machine. Woulfe fidgets, like maybe he's worried about getting billed for these three minutes. She smiles, nods her head and says this: ``Egonomics. Fantasy Adventure. Down Aging. Pleasure Revenge.''<P>

   In Popcorn-speak, this means: Great idea.<P>

   And Woulfe suddenly, seriously, is considering jumping careers. When the trendiest of trend gurus says, ``Go for it,'' people listen.<P>

   ``God, you know, she's absolutely right. Why should any fears or doubts hold you back from chasing your dreams?'' Woulfe says. ``She's a hell of a salesperson.''<P>

     Yep.<P>

     Born on New York's Lower East Side, Popcorn spent her youth in Shanghai before her attorney parents returned to the city. She had dreams of acting but wound up in advertising. In 1974, she founded her research and consulting firm, BrainReserve. After some lean early years, Popcorn emerged as the highest profile name in marketing, fortune-teller for the Fortune 500.<P>

First book<P>

    Her clients have included AT&T, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Kodak, IBM and other big names. Her firm helps them position or even create products -- the Bacardi Breezer line of drinks, for instance. In 1991, her book on trends, The Popcorn Report, became a must on business bookshelves, eventually selling a half-million copies in a dozen languages.<P>

     The book also stamped Popcorn into pop culture. She asked for feedback and got it -- 40,000 calls, letters and faxes, largely from people outside big business.<P>

    ``I never expected nurses and truck drivers and people to write me and stop me on the street, `Are you Faith Popcorn? You changed my life.' ''<P>

    Popcorn sees a lot of people searching for lifelines of happiness in a stormy world. Her mission, she says, has become bringing her Madison Avenue insight to Main Street. Thus, Clicking -- as in the sound of a perfect fit. Her new book, written with colleague Lys Marigold, is less about business and more about self-actualization.<P>

     From Woulfe, she heard a common dilemma: People who play at their passion on weekends or with hobbies but work at something else. Maybe, she says, it's time to ``click.''<P>

      ``Somebody said about me, I'm color-correcting the world, putting people in the right place. I think that's accurate.''<P>

New terms<P>

     For readers of her first book, Clicking covers some familiar territory. Cocooning has become ``armored,'' meaning guard dogs and security alarms. We still lead ``99 Lives'' with too little time and too much to do. But we're also now ``Icon Toppling,'' losing trust in corporations cutting jobs and politicians cutting deals. And, as an offshoot, more people are engaging in ``FemaleThink,'' a warmer, familial approach to management than offered in male-think corporate armies.<P>

     Clicking is an anecdotally-driven, name-, place- and brand-dropping (L.L. Bean, Banana Republic, Diane Sawyer, Calvin Klein, Deer Valley, etc.) survey of middle- and upper-class social trends and concerns. No unwed teen mothers, for instance. Crime, drugs, AIDS, pollution are discussed mainly for how they affect the buying or behavior of those least exposed.<P>

      Popcorn, who says she is 47 (though previous stories indicate she may have ``clicked'' her age), agrees she stresses positive thinking to a distinct audience.<P>

      ``Some guy down at AT&T where I was doing a seminar said, `Faith, I can see a very black side to every one of these trends.' I said, `Yes, but that's not what I talk about.' I can. But I don't think it's a good thing to put into the consciousness.''<P>

Contradictory, yet correct<P>

      Some of the Popcorn style does invite making light: The books' breezy New Age prose -- ``I prefer New Think.'' Her name -- she adopted it after a former boss started calling her Popcorn because he had trouble pronouncing Plotkin. Her hair -- a short spiky red with a delta wing of fuchsia and yellow splashed along one temple (the yellow matches her Ford Mustang in a whimsy of ``Fantasy Adventure,'' she says). And, to a certain extent, her books cover such wide territory that trends can contradict each other but still be correct. People are cocooning but they're also ``wildering,'' meaning buying four-wheel drives to escape the cocoon.<P>

     But it's hard to dispute her research or success.<P>

     Popcorn's 28-person staff reads 350 publications a month from American Health to Yoga Journal and draws on 3,500 experts in an array of fields from Martha Stewart to Deepak Chopra. Popcorn herself easily plucks a staggering volume of statistics and quotations from her head. The firm also interviews 4,000 people a year. She does many herself and excels at it.<P>

     In person, dressed in black, she's Zen-cool with an almost ethereal air befitting a self-described ``futurist.'' But she's also disarmingly warm and witty. She seems to gain instant rapport with whomever she's talking to, often simply asking, ``Are you happy?'' In an appearance on Zeta4 radio with Paul Castronovo and Ron Brewer she sells the Gen X audience this way: ``The future's like a party and you want to be in.''<P>

     And she has an indisputable talent for pinpointing what most of America subconsciously sees happening and putting a label to it before anyone else does. Lots of labels, in fact. ``I have been accused of being cute,'' Popcorn says. But she says her poetic shorthand -- Skippies (school kids with income and purchasing power), Digerati (digital elite) -- helps focus on the big picture.<P>

Through a lens<P>

    Popcorn views everything through a trends lens. The rest of us see the Coen Brothers'  Fargo, with its pregnant sheriff hero and her painter house-husband, and think ``offbeat amusing movie.'' She thinks ``FemaleThink'' and ``Mancipation.''<P>

    ``The Coen Brothers are just socking this thing in. We wrote about this first.''<P>

     In yet-to-emerge trends, Popcorn sees virtual reality replacing supermarkets and even tourist travel. Way down the line, she sees dogs genetically designed to live 50 years, do-it-yourself plastic surgery and computers and humans meshing.<P>

    ``I'm serious about the chip you put in your body. A little chip, you speak French. Another, you play golf. I believe it's going to happen.''
