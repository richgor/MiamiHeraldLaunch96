<m1> <m0>My 2 1/2-year-old daughter is in the bathroom with me a lot, and I don't know how to explain the menstrual cycle to her. I don't want to scare her with the sight of blood, so I try to keep her out, but then she cries.<ql>

<m0>   Some Child Life readers were disturbed about telling a young child <m0>anything <m0>about the menstrual cycle.<ep>
   ``There is no way to explain to a 2 1/2-year-old that there is blood coming out of you when you haven't been wounded,'' says Bonnie, a reader from Miami.<ep>
   Many other mothers, though, say they found that offering a simple explanation worked well.<ep>
   ``I calmly told them that this was my extra blood that helped me grow a baby inside my body when the time was right,'' says Sallianne Hines of Litchfield, Minn., a mother of three. ``I explained that if a baby was growing, it would need this blood. But if there was no baby, this blood just came out.''<ep>
    Many parents who take this approach with their children <m1> <m0>do so to teach sex education in a natural progression. <m1><ep>
<m0>    Keep the explanations simple and truthful, <m1> <m0>recommends Karen Shanor, a clinical psychologist in Washington, D.C.<ep>
   ``Even a 2 1/2-year-old can understand that blood goes all around the body and delivers food to every part so it can grow,'' Shanor says. ``Then, you can say a mommy has blood in her uterus in case there's a baby there that the blood needs to feed. If there's no baby there, you don't need the blood, so it just comes out.''<ep>
   Shanor also advises teaching a child that everyone is entitled to privacy in the bathroom.<ep>
   More tips:<ep>
   (box) If your child's questions catches you off guard, say, ``That's a good question, and I'm not sure. But I will find out.'' Then, be sure to come back with an answer.<ep>
   (box) When faced with a question about reproduction, many adults laugh as a nervous reflex. Don't.<ep>
   (box) Answer just what's asked. If you're not sure what <m0>is <m0>being asked, ask your child. Give information in small bits, then wait for the next question.<ql>
