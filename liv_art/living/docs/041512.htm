   If you have a mental illness, do you know where to go in your area about your civil rights or assistance programs for which you might qualify?<P>

   Of the more than 40 million Americans with mental illness (including the 5-6 million who have significant mental illness such as manic depression or schizophrenia), many don't even know what their civil rights are, much less where to go if there's a question. Do I have to answer questions about my mental health for an employer? What are my rights concerning treatment choices? What's the best way to tell friends and family?<P>

Leading ways<P>

   ``We tell people they should be getting in touch with and finding their state advocacy and protection service office,'' says L.S. Rubenstein, executive director of the Judge David Bazelton Center for Mental Health Law, also known as the Bazelton Center, in Washington, D.C.<P>

   Since 1972, this nonprofit center has helped to advocate for people with mental illness disabilities at the national level. Center staff have worked on everything from federal policy to housing rights. And while they don't take on individual service situations, they have affected the millions who have a mental illness by working for changes in the law and the institutions that serve them.<P>

   ``We don't handle a lot of individual problems,'' Rubenstein says. ``We do advocate for public policy on the supports and the communities of those with mental illness. We want to make sure there are equal coverages for mental health, for example, with insurance; that people with mental illness have access to the services in their areas. We want to make sure there are enforceable rights in the courts, and that people with mental illness who are on low-income programs have what they need to survive: housing, income benefits; that families with children get Social Security Income benefits, that children with mental illness get the free and public education to which they're entitled.''<P>

Center's new projects<P>

   The center has indeed changed the lives of those with mental illness both in the courts and in everyday settings. Rubenstein, who has been executive director of the center six years, says there are several ongoing projects in the works.<P>

   ``We're seeking to make sure that with the issue of insurance, that mental health coverage is equal to physical health coverage,'' he says. ``To that end, in mid-April, the U.S. Senate passed an amendment to that effect called the Parity Amendment. [The Senate is also considering the same issues under the Health Insurance Bill.] We will continue to advocate for and follow that. We're also working on the issue of managed care, that as states might change their own Medicaid programs, we want to make sure people with mental illness have adequate care. On the issue of fair housing, we want people with mental illness disabilities to be sure they have adequate housing and are not discriminated against with such things like rent or having a landlord refuse to rent to them.<P>

   ``We're also working on the backlash which has fallen against the Americans with Disabilities Act. So many people think you can't be fired on the job if you have a disability. That's not true. There's so much misinformation out there. We want to get what's accurate out, and employment is just one of the areas.''<P>

Three historic cases<P>

   Rubenstein is proud of the center's past. He cites at least three historic legal cases the center has helped work on with individual attorneys that have changed the lives of those with mental illness for all time.<P>

   ``I'd say the first is a case in the 1970s known as Wyatt vs. Stickney. That conveys the establishment of the rights to treatment of people with mental illness in institutions. It's a very fundamental case. Another case is Potomac Group Home vs. Montgomery County. That was in the early 1990s. The case essentially says a neighborhood does not have a say as to whether a group home can be established there. People have the right to live where they want, and in this case it involved a group home of elders with Alzheimer's. They had the right to live where they wanted just as anyone else does.<P>

   ``Some two years ago there was lark vs. The Virginia Board of Bar Examiners. The board, before that, was asking people who applied to take the exam about their mental health history, if they had ever had a mental illness. We helped determine that that was discriminatory and unfair. No one can ask those questions.''<P>

   Currently the center can provide more than 17 publications on the subject of mental illness and civil rights as well as backup on more than 40 legal cases which have set precedents. The Links Consortium through the center can also provide information on the rights of children with mental illness. And the staff of 20 can also assist attorneys and government agencies who have questions about mental illness and disability rights. With an operating budget of more than $2 million, the center will continue to fight for the rights of those with mental illness disabilities. And as an individual, Rubenstein says the way to join that fight is by asking what your rights are, by getting accurate information on personal issues.<P>
