<m0>(box) The stages of grief.<ep>
<m0>   There are many signs of grief, but not everyone experiences them all in the same order. You may experience denial, anger, guilt, depression, acceptance and resolution.<ep>
Grieving is a personal process. Some people take longer than others, and each loss is different.<ep>
<m0>(box) <m1> <m0>They may not understand.<ep>
<m0>   Well-meaning family and friends may not realize how important your animal was to you or the intensity of your grief. Comments they make may seem cruel and uncaring. Be honest with yourself and others about how you feel. If despair mounts, talk to someone who will listen about your animal and the illness and death. . . . Talk about your sorrow, but also about the fun times you and the animal spent together.<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>(box) The hurt is so deep.<ep>
<m0>   If you or a family member has great difficulty in accepting your animal's death and cannot resolve feelings of grief and sorrow, you may want to discuss <m4> BEGIN LEG #2 <m0>those feelings with a person who is trained to understand the grieving process. Among them are your veterinarian, animal loss support groups and hotlines, grief counselors, clergy.<ep>
<m0>(box)  <m1>  <m0>Should I get another animal?<ep>
<m0>   Some people may feel they would never want another animal. For others, a new animal may help them get over the loss more quickly. Just as grief is a personal experience, the decision of when, if ever, to bring a new animal into your home is also a personal one. If a family member is having difficulty accepting the animal's death, bringing a new animal into the home before that person has resolved his or her grief may imply that the life of the deceased animal was unworthy of the grief still being felt.<ep>
<m0>(box) <m1>  <m0>Remembering your animal.<ep>
<m0>   Try to recall the good times you spent with your animal. By remembering the pleasure of those times, you can realize your animal was worthy of your grief. <m1><styl>nugend<ql>
