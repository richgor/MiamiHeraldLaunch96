   If a court motion filed last week by Miami bankruptcy trustee James Feltman is accepted by creditors, Hialeah-based Southern Book Service, the book distributor that serviced 1,000 accounts across South Florida before going belly up, will put up $750,000 to end a nasty saga that began four months ago.<P>

   ``The court must approve it and creditors must not object,'' said Miami attorney Tom Lehman of the Tew & Beasley law firm, who represents Feltman.<P>

   The impact will be felt across the nation; Southern initially owed 206 publishers $4 million.<P>

   ``I'm just one of the little guys, owed $6,000,'' said Miami's Arva Moore Parks, whose Centennial Press publishes Miami, The Magic City by Parks and Miami Beach: A History  by Howard Kleinberg, former executive editor of the defunct Miami News.<P>

   The bigger publishers included Random House (owed $700,000), HarperCollins ($500,000), Penguin ($500,000) and Putnam ($175,000). When they learned that Southern had sold its assets in January, they feared they'd never get paid for books already in Southern's hands and filed a suit forcing the firm into bankruptcy.<P>

   ``From that moment, all property became the property of the estate,'' said Patricia Redmond, a Miami attorney with the Stearns Weaver law firm who represents the publishing houses.<P>

   That small detail annoys Parks, who attempted to retrieve 120 books delivered to Southern ``one week before the sale.'' She hasn't been paid, can't get the books distributed and, when the mess is settled, will be lucky if she receives 50 cents for every dollar owed.<P>

   ``The national chains -- Barnes & Noble, B Dalton, Waldenbooks, almost all of them -- require you to have a distributor,'' she said. ``You can't just walk in and do business with a proprietor; there has to be a middle man.''<P>

 <BR>
   Other firms in her position, according to court papers, include the University Presses of Florida in Gainesville, Andrews & McMeel, Smithsonian Institution Press, Simon & Schuster, St. Martins Press, Rand McNally, Little Brown, Harcourt Brace, Harry Abrams and Abbeville Press.<P>

 <BR>
  According to the proposed settlement, Feltman's accountants have until May 13 to examine the books of Book Warehouse, which paid $2 million for Southern's assets, Lehman said. And that could lead to further difficulty. <P>

   ``There were tons of return items,'' he said. ``The assets when transferred may not have been as valuable as the initial price placed on them.''<P>

   Stay tuned.<P>

   Dade School Board member Janet McAliley is not a happy camper about recent examples of freedom of speech, or lack thereof.<P>

   When she gives the commencement address for the New World School of the Arts grads June 12, she'll focus on the issue.<P>

   ``I want to talk about the artist's responsibility not only to expand our concept of the universe but also to defend the right of other artists to do that,'' she said. When [pianist Gonzalo] Rubalcaba played at Gusman [April 10], there was some criticism that no other musicians came forth to play with him, that they were intimidated.<P>

   ``In this community, our artists, more than any other group probably, represent our multiple identities. They must support each other.''<P>

   Prominent Miami artist Leonard Pardon is getting national attention these days, thanks to a WLRN-produced public television series that is airing from Montana to Maryland.<P>

   Leonard Par<BR>
don's 13-part Faux Finish Series, which teaches viewers how to create decorative finishes for walls and furniture such as marble, tortoise shell, bird's eye maple and malachite, begins airing at 9:30 a.m. today on Channel 17 and will air daily through mid-June.<P>

   Pardon, whose studio is in Miami's Design District, has worked in Buckingham Palace, London's House of Lords, sultans' palaces in Oman, Ugo Colombo's 8,000-square-foot penthouse on Miami's Brickell Avenue and in some of Palm Beach's more opulent mansions.<P>

   Kudos to South Miami surfboarder Monique Echeverria, 21, who graduates from UM Friday and who just won the eastern championship of the National Scholastic Surfing Association at Sebastian Inlet north of Vero Beach. <P>

   Come June 24-29, she'll be in San Clemente, Calif., trying to win the national title.<P>

   The Pacific, of course, generates far heftier waves than the smooth waters just off South Beach, where Echeverria has done ``90 percent of my surfing. My hobby is to watch the weather reports and pray for a Northeast storm.''<P>

   Her surfing start began in Kendall, when she was 12 or 13. Skateboarding friends (mostly boys) ``wouldn't let me go off the ramp'' for fear she would outshine them. One day, she maneuvered around them, and sure enough, executed the best jump of the day. Immediately, she was blackballed. ``That's when I said, `I've got  to find something else to do.' ''
