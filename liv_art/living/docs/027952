<m0>y wife Lynda and I were taking a Saturday jog on the beach when she suddenly doubled over from a wave of nausea.<ep>
   ``I swear it feels like morning sickness,'' she said.<ep>
   I could think of no response other than, ``Heh, heh, heh.''<ep>
   We're in our mid-40s, and folks our age don't even think about having babies. The factory's closed. The crew's laid off. We're reproductively downsized. So ``heh, heh, heh'' was the best I could manage.<ep>
   Still, stranger things have happened (--) we could've been hit by errant fertility rays from the mother ship meant for Madonna. So we went on yellow alert, keeping a loose eye on the situation, but remaining steadfastly in denial until conditions reverted to green.<ep>
   The mistake I made was joking about it with our daughter Sarah, 11.<ep>
   ``Mom's got morning sickness,'' I said.<ep>
   ``That's not even funny,'' Sarah answered.<ep>
   ``Well, she said it seemed like <m2><ql>

<m0>morning sickness.''<ep>

<m0>  There was dead silence for about a minute.<ep>
   ``Is it really possible?'' Sarah asked.<ep>
   ``Everything is possible.''<ep>
   ``No, I mean do you actually have reason to believe it's possible?''<ep>
   ``What do you think we are (--) monks?''<ep>
   Sarah has long wished for a brother or sister. Most of her friends have siblings, and she has discovered that the noisier and more crowded a home is, the more fun it is, too.<ep>
   But if she and probably every other kid in the world had to choose between having siblings or having parents who have taken vows of celibacy for life, she'd be helping write up the vows herself.<ep>
   For all the exposure to sex on TV and in movies, kids don't believe it could possibly happen in <m0>their <m0>homes. Sex, they think, is for singers; sex is for movie stars. It may even be something kids can imagine for themselves one day. But sex is definitely not for those colorless old drones they know as their parents.<ep>
   And is that self-fulfilling? Do we sometimes end up living too close to our children's sterile expectations and become the colorless old drones they think we are? Then, one day they leave the nest and what's left? Romance is the most perishable product of all.<ep>
   But that's a pretty tough concept to convey to a kid. If there's a way to convince children that their parents are human, I haven't found it.<ep>
   Sarah and I were thrown together for the rest of that Saturday without Lynda, who was working. For the two of us, the day was a long succession of silences, as she kept her nose in a book, trying as best she could to keep me out of her day.<ep>
   ``Why are you acting this way?'' I asked her.<ep>
   ``You're too old,'' she said. ``It's not safe.''<ep>
   ``Too old for sex, or too old for babies?''<ep>
   ``Well . . .''<ep>
   ``Even Grandma and Grandpa have sex, I'll bet,'' I said.<ep>
   ``It's OK for them,'' she said.<ep>
   ``I don't get it. Why are parents different?''<ep>
   ``Well, I don't want to talk about it with you,'' she said. ``I don't even know if I'm mad. I haven't decided.''<ep>
   In the end, she wasn't <m0>too <m0>mad. She just hopes the scare has taught us a lesson, taught us to start behaving like properly dull, genderless parents.<ep>
   I promised I would.<ep>
   Heh, heh, heh.<ql>
