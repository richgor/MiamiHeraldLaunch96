<B><FONT SIZE=+3>  Q.</FONT></B> My 2 1/2-year-old daughter is in the bathroom with me a lot, and I don't know how to explain the menstrual cycle to her. I don't want to scare her with the sight of blood, so I try to keep her out, but then she cries.<BR>

   Some Child Life readers were disturbed about telling a young child anything about the menstrual cycle.<P>

   ``There is no way to explain to a 2 1/2-year-old that there is blood coming out of you when you haven't been wounded,'' says Bonnie, a reader from Miami.<P>

   Many other mothers, though, say they found that offering a simple explanation worked well.<P>

   ``I calmly told them that this was my extra blood that helped me grow a baby inside my body when the time was right,'' says Sallianne Hines of Litchfield, Minn., a mother of three. ``I explained that if a baby was growing, it would need this blood. But if there was no baby, this blood just came out.''<P>

    Many parents who take this approach with their children do so to teach sex education in a natural progression. <P>

    Keep the explanations simple and truthful, recommends Karen Shanor, a clinical psychologist in Washington, D.C.<P>

   ``Even a 2 1/2-year-old can understand that blood goes all around the body and delivers food to every part so it can grow,'' Shanor says. ``Then, you can say a mommy has blood in her uterus in case there's a baby there that the blood needs to feed. If there's no baby there, you don't need the blood, so it just comes out.''<P>

   Shanor also advises teaching a child that everyone is entitled to privacy in the bathroom.<P>

   More tips:<P>

   <LI> If your child's questions catches you off guard, say, ``That's a good question, and I'm not sure. But I will find out.'' Then, be sure to come back with an answer.<P>

   <LI> When faced with a question about reproduction, many adults laugh as a nervous reflex. Don't.<P>

   <LI> Answer just what's asked. If you're not sure what is being asked, ask your child. Give information in small bits, then wait for the next question.<BR>

   <LI> Girls and grades: ``My 12-year-old is in all honors classes, and he has recently discovered girls,'' says Lisa Marsh of Cedar Hill, Texas. ``He rushes through his homework and spends the rest of the evening on the telephone. His grades are suffering. What can we do?''
