  Look up to the skies this weekend and hold your ears.<P>

   The rockets' red glare, bombs bursting in the air: They're not just an anthem anymore.<P>

   The Shell Air & Sea Show -- running Saturday and Sunday along, off and over a stretch of Fort Lauderdale beach -- returns for a second year to thrill us with amazing aerial and splashy water attractions.<P>

<P>

   Oh, and blond Beverly Hills, 90210  brat Steve, aka Ian Ziering, doing his best to mimic Tom Cruise in Top Gun mode, will take a preshow ride at 8 a.m. today in an F-18 fighter jet to celebrate the Blue Angels' 50th anniversary. <P>

<P>

   The oceanfront spectacle is a salute to the U.S. military with all five branches participating. Highlights include the the U.S. Air Force B-2 ``Stealth'' Bomber soaring over Fort Lauderdale beach -- a high-tech aircraft invisible to radar but presumably not to spectators. The Army ``Golden Knights'' Parachute Team will leap from planes nearly two miles above the crowd, reaching speeds of 150 miles per hour as they aim for a five-foot target on the beach. The Navy SEALs will arrive over the ocean by helicopter, rappel down ropes and blow up a prop building, bombs and bullets blazing around them. Then the U.S. Coast Guard Air/Sea Rescue Team will perform a life-saving demonstration from its ``Dolphin'' helicopter and 41-foot rescue boat. On a tamer level, a Display Village open both days will feature demonstrations and showcase equipment. <P>

<P>

   Then there's the Nerveless Nocks of Switzerland, a circus family that performs stunts atop 90-foot tall poles without a net. The finale is an upside-down free fall you'll have to see to understand.<P>

   To ease your nerves after Nerveless, check out Saturday's free Tom Scott jazz saxophone performance at 8 p.m. on the beach stage. You might remember Scott from his instrumental backing of Barbra Streisand, Joni Mitchell, Paul McCartney and others. A fireworks extravaganza follows.<P>

IF YOU GO<P>

<P>

  Saturday and Sunday's water events take place from 10 a.m. to noon, air events from noon to 4 p.m. Other activities run 9 a.m.-10 p.m. Saturday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday. Air and sea performances are along the beach between Oakland Park Boulevard and the 17th Street Causeway, Fort Lauderdale. Center stage is on the beach, at State Road A1A and Sunrise Boulevard.<P>

   Getting there: Vehicle access to the beach will be limited -- cross at 17th Street Causeway or East Oakland Park Boulevard. To get to the Causeway from the south, take Interstate 95 north to State Road 84, east to U.S. 1, north to 17th Street Causeway and east to the beach or take Oakland Park east to beach. Beach residents, business owners and employees will get passes allowing entry to checkpoints at East Sunrise Boulevard at Northeast 26th Avenue, A1A at Northeast 19th Street and East Las Olas Boulevard at Southeast 15th Avenue.<P>

    Park-and-ride shuttle services: Get round-trip bus service from Holiday Park and from downtown parking garages to Sunrise Boulevard and A1A. Parking at either site is $3. Round-trip ride is $3 per person. Buses will start at 8 a.m. both days, and will end one hour after the event (about 11 p.m. Saturday, 6 p.m. Sunday). <P>

 <LI> From downtown: To get to city garages, which include lots by the Main Library (100 S. Andrews Ave.) and the Broward Center for the Performing Arts (201 SW Fifth Ave.), take I-95 to Broward Boulevard and head east. Yellow school buses will pick up and drop off passengers along Southeast First Avenue between Broward Boulevard and Southeast Second Street.<P>

 <LI> From Holiday Park: Exit I-95 at Sunrise Boulevard and head east. Enter at U.S. 1 and Nininger Drive or at Northeast 12th Avenue and Sunrise Boulevard. County buses will pick up passengers at the Sunrise Boulevard park entrance, which is marked by a stationary, full-size airplane.<P>

  Water Taxi also will provide service for the show. Call (954) 467-6677 for cost, details.<P>

   Information: (954) 527-5600 ext. 88. News Radio WINZ (940 AM) and Spanish Radio Accion WACC (830 AM) to feature on-air military personnel narrating the action.
