<m0>rincess Kitty's toys are still scattered all over Karen Payne's South Miami townhouse (--) her rubber balls, her feathers, her scratching post. Her bowls are still on the floor in the kitchen.<ep>
   Her little wagon, the tiny pink chair she sat in, the sequined dresses and bathing suits and bonnets she wore when she performed, are all still out.<ep>
   Her ashes rest on an altar draped in pink satin in the middle of the living room, inside a pretty tin box with a white ceramic cat angel sitting on top. Beside it, always, are fresh flowers from the florist. <ep>
   But then, Princess Kitty, who died Dec. 21 at age 10, wasn't just any cat. <ep>
   She was a cat with her own newspaper column and international fan club. A cat who could play <m0>Three Blind Mice <m0> on a toy piano, slam-dunk a mini-basketball through a hoop, jump high hurdles. A cat who could put any dog to shame in the sit-stay-fetch department. She played Hemingway's favorite cat in the 1988 TV miniseries <m0>Hemingway<m0>, starring Stacey Keach; she starred in a Florida Lotto commercial last year promoting the Fishfinder's game; she posed for the cover of Cat Fancy magazine in 1990.<ep>
   As felines go, she led an extraordinary life. Perhaps that is why her death has been such a blow to her owner.<ep>
   Not that Payne, a former Miami News reporter who is now editor of the Miami-based Honeymoon magazine, would consider herself Princess Kitty's <m0>owner.<m0> She was more Kitty's friend, her companion, her partner.<ep>
  ``Princess Kitty's death broke <m2><ql>

PLEASE SEE  PRINCESS,  3D<qr>

<m0>my heart,'' Payne says. ``I don't know how long it takes to fix a broken heart.''<ep>
    Some people might say she's gone overbgard with her grief, with her daily journal about life without Princess Kitty, her scrapbook of condolence cards, her tears (--) four months later (--) when she tries to talk about her cat.<ep>
   But veterinarians and other animal-human bond experts say grieving an animal is no different from grieving a human member of the family (--) and it's time the pain of losing a pet gains legitimacy.<ep>
   ``Imagine what it's like if for 10 or 20 years there was someone there to kiss you and hug you when you had a hard day, and now they're gone,'' says Princess Kitty's longtime veterinarian, Dr. Ronald Stone.<ep>
<m0>Love that lasts<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   As more people move away from their extended families, they are developing closer ties to their pets, and society needs to understand that, says Dr. Leighann Daristotle, a spokeswoman for the American Veterinary Medical Association outside Chicago.<ep>
   ``With jobs the way they are and more people going through geographic isolation, sometimes pets are as close as relatives,'' she says. ``When they die, there is little support, and that just makes it tougher.''<ep>
   When a person dies, there is a memorial service, there are friends and relatives willing to listen, there is time off from work. People with religious beliefs find comfort in the idea of heaven. But many churches say animals have no souls and can't go to heaven.<ep>
   ``Not having that kind of support is devastating for a person grieving their animal,'' Daristotle says. ``There is very little to validate your feelings.''<ep>
      Stone says it makes sense for Payne to go through an especially tough time.<ep>
   ``Princess Kitty was a remarkable cat. She and Karen developed the type of companion bond a police officer has with a K-9. This was not just a pet, this was her partner, like George Burns and Gracie,'' he says.<ep>
<m0>Support and solace<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   Payne has found solace in a pet-loss support group sponsored by the Humane Society of Greater Miami. They meet twice a month at the Kendall branch of the Dade Public Library.<ep>
   ``When people can get together and share their pain, they get to feel it's not a crazy thing,'' says Judith Tobin, a Miami psychotherapist who leads the group. ``It takes the edge off. We had a man in his 40s, married, with kids, who came and spent over an hour crying over his dog. I thought it was wonderful that he was able to work it through.''<ep>
   Isabel Rojas, who runs an ornamental plant nursery in Homestead, says the group is helping her with the death of her dog, Maya, a white lab mix who died in February at age 3 as a result of intestinal blockage.<ep>
   ``I do have my bad days,'' says Rojas, who is in her early 50s. ``There have been some supportive people, but it got to the point where I stopped talking about it because people think there should be a time frame for grieving a pet, and they think it's kind of weird that you should be missing a pet so badly.'' <ep>
<m0>Friend and companion<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   But Maya was much more than a pet to Rojas.<ep>
   ``She was the dog I had always wanted. She grew up with me. I trained her, and she could understand so much. She was my delivery partner. She went everywhere with me.''<ep>
Payne has begun to deal with her grief by talking about it. At first, she refused to tell anyone about Princess Kitty's death except her mother and a few close friends <ep>
   The cat died suddenly in Dallas, after complications from surgery to remove a BB that had been lodged in her back since Payne took her in as a stray kitten. Payne filed a complaint with the Texas state veterinary licensing board.<ep>
   ``Before these events, I said many times that I felt I couldn't live without Princess Kitty because I felt so bonded with her. We had a very profound sort of love,'' says Payne, who won't tell her age. ``I found myself quite amazed that she could die and I was still living. I had felt in a very significant way that we were partners. We were soul mates.''<ep>
   Payne began training Princess Kitty as a kitten on the suggestion of her first vet, the late Dr. Robert P. Knowles, who Payne says told her he thought Princess Kitty was one of the smartest cats he had ever seen.<ep>
<m0>Start of a popular act<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   They <m1> <m0>worked together every day, first learning basic obedience tricks, then graduating to piano playing and ballet dancing. They took their show on the road, performing for kids in schools and hospitals, and appearing in newspapers and on television across the country. Payne ghost-wrote a column for her in the community newspaper The Kendall Gazette.<ep>
   As she processes her death, Payne is coming to a better understanding of her relationship with her cat.<ep>
   ``When we were performing together, <m1> <m0>there was such magic. It is as if time stopped. We brought joy to children. It's a very special thing to see sick children smile. She drew people in, while I tend to be more of an introvert. Because of her I was able to appear on TV and radio in places as far away as Australia. Now my effort is to take into myself the qualities she brought out in our partnership so that I can be whole again.''<ep>
   But wgrking through the grief is a slow process. She's been working with a shamanic practitioner who is helping her have ``continued communication on a meditative plane'' with Princess Kitty, and she plans to complete Princess Kitty's autobiography, which she started several years ago.<ep>
   And, ``I expect that at some point, I will pick up her bowls frgm the kitchen floor,'' Payne says.<ep>
