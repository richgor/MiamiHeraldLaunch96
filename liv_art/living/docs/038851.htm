n Lithuania, rear-end collisions happen much as they do in the rest of the world. Cars crash, bumpers crumple, tempers flare.<P>

   But, somehow, drivers who get in wrecks there seem not to suffer the long-term complaints so common in other countries: the headaches or lingering neck pains that have come to be known as chronic whiplash.<P>

   It's not that cars are any safer in Lithuania. And the average Lithuanian neck isn't any stronger.<P>

   The difference, a new study says, is that drivers in Lithuania didn't carry personal-injury insurance at the time of the study, and people there weren't in the habit of suing one another. Most medical bills were paid by the government.<P>

   And although some private insurance is now appearing, at the time there were no claims to be filed, no money to be won and nothing to be gained from a diagnosis of chronic whiplash. Most Lithuanians, in fact, had never even heard of whiplash.<P>

   The circumstances in Lithuania are described in the current issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal, by a team of Norwegian researchers who conducted a study there. The results, they wrote, suggest that the chronic whiplash syndrome ``has little validity.''<P>

Norway's surprise<P>

   The study was prompted by ``an explosion of chronic-whiplash cases in Norway,'' said Dr. Harald Schrader, a neurologist at University Hospital in Trondheim. ``We are topping the world list. In a country of 4.2 million, we have 70,000 people in a patients' organization who feel they have chronic disability because of whiplash. People are claiming compensation for injuries from mechanical forces not more than you would get in daily life, from coughing, sneezing, running down the steps,plopping into a chair. And they are getting millions of kroner in compensation. It's mass hysteria.''<P>

   Schrader said he and his colleagues chose Lithuania for the whiplash study ``because there is no awareness there about whiplash or potential disabling consequences, and no, or very seldom, insurance for personal injury.''<P>

   Comparing answers<P>

   Without disclosing the purpose of the study, the researchers gave health questionnaires to 202 drivers whose cars had been struck from behind one to three years earlier. The accidents varied in severity; 11 percent of the cars had severe damage, the rest had either mild or moderate damage.<P>

The drivers were questioned about symptoms, and their answers were compared with the answers of a control group made up of the same number of people, of similar ages, from the same town, who had not been in a car accident. The study found no difference between the two groups.<P>

   Thirty-five percent of the accident victims reported neck pain, but so did 33 percent of the controls. Similarly, 53 percent who had been in accidents had headaches, but so did 50 percent of the controls. The researchers concluded, ``No one in the study group had disabling or persistent symptoms as a result of the car accident.''<P>

Not one case<P>

   Schrader said he and his colleagues were astounded by the results. Even though they were skeptical about chronic whiplash, they had expected that a few genuine cases would turn up. But not one did -- not even among the 16 percent of drivers who recalled having neck pain shortly after their accidents.<P>

   When the subjects were finally told the real purpose of the study, they were amazed to learn that anyone could think that an accident that had happened more than a year ago could still be causing health problems. Schrader recalled, ``They said, `Headaches? Why don't you ask me why after two years I still haven't got the spare part for my bumper?' ''<P>

   When the findings were publicized in Norway, Schrader said the leader of the whiplash patients' organization threatened to sue him. Questions were also raised about whether the research had been financed by the insurance industry. The answer, he said, is no; the money came from his university.<P>

   Schrader said he did not doubt the existence of short-term whiplash injuries but did doubt the validity of chronic cases. His conclusions agree with those of a study, published a year ago in the journal Spine, that concluded that about 90 percent of whiplash injuries healed on their own in days or a few weeks and needed very little treatment.<P>

Not that simple<P>

   But other injuries may persist, physicians say. ``You can't conclude from this small study that whiplash syndrome doesn't exist,'' said Dr. Paul McCormick, an associate professor of neurosurgery at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. ``But the researchers are right on in questioning the prevalence.''<P>

   McCormick said that some patients sustained lasting, identifiable injuries from whiplash but that milder cases were hard to diagnose. ``We don't have objective criteria for those,'' he said. ``There's no lab test.''<P>

   Soft-tissue injuries don't show up clearly on X-rays or in MRI scans. The diagnosis is based on symptoms reported by the patient, who may or may not be reliable. ``We have to be careful as scientists and human beings not to see everyone as scheming and lying,'' McCormick said.<P>

   Other specialists also say that some chronic whiplash cases are real.<P>

   ``I've seen patients 25 years down the road still having problems,'' said Dr. Barry August, a dentist who is a director of the head and facial pain-management program at New York University Medical Center. The condition can become chronic, he said, when people alter their posture to relieve the pain of injured tendons and muscles. ``They begin to compensate,'' he said, ``and these compensations also cause problems.''<P>

   August also questioned the methods in the Lancet study. Even though the people in the control group had not been in car accidents, they might have had other injuries, he said.<P>

   ``Falling down the stairs, slipping on the ice, can set off a whiplash injury,'' he said, ``and it can be longstanding. For controls, you'd need to look at people without any injuries, even in childhood.''<P>

Growing fraud<P>

   Whiplash is the bane of the insurance industry. From half to two-thirds of all the people who file injury claims from car accidents report back and neck sprains. Insurers say some of those claims are false, or exaggerated.<P>

   The National Insurance Crime Bureau estimates that $16 of every $100 paid out in auto injury claims is for fraudulent claims and that half of that amount is paid for ``exaggerated soft-tissue claims,'' which include whiplash. Phony medical claims cost the insurance industry billions of dollars; those expenses are passed on to the public and add from $100 to $130 to the price of each car-insurance policy, said Carolyn Gorman, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute in Washington.<P>

   ``Whiplash is a claim that's growing,'' Gorman said. ``But you can't be glib and think everybody's faking it. For someone who really has whiplash, it is painful and it can last a long time and cost a lot of money. But it's hard to tell whether someone has it. You can't prove it.''
