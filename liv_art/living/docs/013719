<m0>  Look up to the skies this weekend and hold your ears.<ep>
   The rockets' red glare, bombs bursting in the air: They're not just an anthem anymore.<ep>
   The Shell Air & Sea Show (--) running Saturday and Sunday along, off and over a stretch of Fort Lauderdale beach (--) returns for a second year to thrill us with amazing aerial and splashy water attractions.<ep>

<m0>   Oh, and blond <m0>Beverly Hills, 90210  <m0>brat Steve, aka Ian Ziering, doing his best to mimic Tom Cruise in<m0> Top Gun<m0> mode, will take a preshow ride at 8 a.m. today in an F-18 fighter jet to celebrate the Blue Angels' 50th anniversary. <m1><ep>
<ep>
<m0>   The oceanfront spectacle is a salute to the U.S. military with all five branches participating. Highlights include the the U.S. Air Force B-2 ``Stealth'' Bomber soaring over Fort Lauderdale beach (--) a high-tech aircraft invisible to radar but presumably not to spectators. The Army ``Golden Knights'' Parachute Team will leap from planes nearly two miles above the crowd, reaching speeds of 150 miles per hour as they aim for a five-foot target on the beach. The Navy SEALs will arrive over the ocean by helicopter, rappel down ropes and blow up a prop building, bombs and bullets blazing around them. Then the U.S. Coast Guard Air/Sea Rescue Team will perform a life-saving demonstration from its ``Dolphin'' helicopter and 41-foot rescue boat. On a tamer level, a Display Village open both days will feature demonstrations and showcase equipment. <ep>

<m0>   Then there's the Nerveless Nocks of Switzerland, a circus family that performs stunts atop 90-foot tall poles without a net. The finale is an upside-down free fall you'll have to see to understand.<ep>
   To ease your nerves after Nerveless, check out Saturday's free Tom Scott jazz saxophone performance at 8 p.m. on the beach stage. You might remember Scott from his instrumental backing of Barbra Streisand, Joni Mitchell, Paul McCartney and others. A fireworks extravaganza follows.<ep>
