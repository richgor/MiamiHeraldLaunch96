n the dream, Mr. Ferguson is dressed in white. A bright light surrounds him. He holds out his hand, palm up, and smiles.<P>

   ``Don't go, don't go,'' Sandra Vanegas, 11, pleads.<P>

   But the light in her bedroom window vanishes and she is left alone, thinking about her first-grade teacher.<P>

   It's been five months since Kenneth Ferguson, Kensington Park Elementary School's favorite teacher, died in a car wreck on a rainy Saturday afternoon in Miami Lakes, and two generations of students and a school full of teachers still miss him.<P>

   They dream about him. Talk about him. Write about him. Turn to him.<P>

   A teacher looks to the heavens and clenches her fist when her class won't behave. ``Please, Mr. Ferguson, help me.''<P>

   Custodians rush to fix the plumbing in a classroom bathroom. ``Oh, that's Ferguson, up to his science experiments again.''<P>

   A student breathes a sigh of relief when the substitute teacher forgets to collect unfinished homework. ``Thank you, Mr. Ferguson.''<P>

   ``To the students, he's a saint or a ghost watching over them,'' says third-grade teacher Marcia Giro, who worked with him for 20 years. ``To me, he's here, OK? I feel him, I feel the vibes. You're talking about someone who has made a difference in a lot of lives.''<P>

   Mr. Ferguson was folklore long before his death at age 60 on Dec. 9. He was one of the first black teachers for a generation of white students at Kensington Park Elementary. It was January 1970, and the all-white school in a northwest nook of Miami known as Grapeland Heights was integrating its staff and classrooms.<P>

   Twenty years later, many of those same students fought to get their children into Mr. Ferguson's class. They had grown up and moved on with life, but Mr. Ferguson was still there -- his room full of dead animals in formaldehyde jars, his desk swamped with papers and projects, his playful grin greeting everyone at the door.<P>

   In a place where names and faces change with chameleon speed, Mr. Ferguson could be counted on. In 26 years at Kensington Park, he taught almost every grade level, every summer school. In his last year, he became a specialist, going from class to class with science lessons.<P>

   Practically every student has a story about Mr. Ferguson. How he liked to jump on his desk, toss his tie over his shoulder and glare down at students, repeating the chant, ``You will not cheat on this test'' until they heard it over and over in their heads. How he pretended to cry if students wouldn't listen to him, pitching the class into a concerned hush.<P>

   How he let well-behaved students take his iguana or lizard or mouse home for the weekend and rewarded them with Friday ice cream parties long before ``positive reinforcement'' became a catch phrase among teachers who lost their paddles to anti-corporal punishment mandates.<P>

Eager for his approval<P>

   <P>

   Nobody can remember Mr. Ferguson sending a child to detention or raising his voice. Kids wanted to behave for this slight, demure teacher because they wanted him to like them, just as he liked their parents and cousins and older brothers and sisters, who filled their heads with ``Fergie'' tales.<P>

   ``Was Mr. Ferguson your teacher, too?'' a third-grader asked, tugging on a reporter's sleeve at the school this week.<P>

   When Grapeland Heights' identity began to melt into nearby Little Havana and the white, non-Hispanic neighborhood residents sold their homes to Hispanic families, Mr. Ferguson stayed, adjusted and remained a favorite.<P>

   He started craving cafecitos  at the Latin cafeteria across Northwest Seventh Street. He learned to sing and wiggle his hips to El Burrito Sabanero (The Little Donkey from the Savanna), a classic Spanish carol he requested every Christmas. He became ``Pepe'' to his Spanish-speaking colleagues.<P>

    ``I was surprised at how much we agreed about things,'' says Melvin M. Blanco, a physical education teacher who shared a love of gardening, God and children with Mr. Ferguson. ``Skin was secondary with us. When we talked, it was about how we were the examples. How the world would change if we changed.''<P>

   In Miami, where ethnic rifts and racial resentments run deep, there are thousands of people who live their lives away from the headlines. Their days are not filled with riots, courtroom dramas or protests. They work with people of different colors and languages. They eat lunch with them. They pass on the street. They manage to get along.<P>

   And, once in awhile, they transcend all the talk about race and conflict and have a profound impact on those around them. Mr. Ferguson was such a man.<P>

Integrating Kensington Park<P>

   <P>

   ``I remember them coming in and there being a lot of cars and a lot of people standing outside,'' says Patricia Clarke, who was one of Mr. Ferguson's first white students in fourth grade in 1970, the year he and a half-dozen other black teachers integrated Kensington Park.<P>

   ``I remember thinking, `What the heck is going on?' '' she said. ``Mr. Ferguson and the others were coming in, almost like they were marching in single file, and parents were standing outside the gate and us kids were being told to go to class. I think a lot of the people just came to see what they looked like.''<P>

   Gwendolyn W. Smith, a black teacher who transferred that same year, recalls the children handled the situation much better than the adults. Her students met her at her classroom door with apples in their hands. But Clarke remembers standing in the main office, hearing one white teacher complaining because he didn't want to team-teach with a black teacher.<P>

   Liberty City native<P>

   Kenneth Eugene Ferguson was born and raised in Liberty City. He graduated from Booker T. Washington High, Dade County's first black high school. A diehard sports fan, he loved everything Miami: the Dolphins, the Heat, University of Miami football.<P>

   <P>

   A child of segregation, he deplored racial conflict, purposely avoided it, some would say. Turn the other cheek was his motto, right or wrong.<P>

   When black teachers complained last year that an administrator was favoring Hispanic teachers, Ferguson abruptly left the faculty meeting. ``I'm not in favor of you bringing this up,'' he said politely.<P>

   When a rumor spread that a white assistant principal had reprimanded him for slipping across the street for a Cuban coffee, he called together the black teachers and told them it wasn't true.<P>

   Last year, Henny Cristopol, 24, an education major at Florida International University, returned to his fifth-grade teacher's classroom to observe. ``How'd you get through those tough times?'' he asked his former teacher.<P>

   ``Keep a smile on your face,'' Mr. Ferguson told him.<P>

   ``I asked him why the heck he had been doing this for 30 years. He got real quiet, then said, `I love this.' I said, `Come on, cut the bull----.' And he said, `No, I really, really love this.' He wasn't going to let race or anything get in the way.''<P>

   Clarke, the student, made sure her daughter Pamela got him for third grade 16 years later. She wasn't alone. At one time, the list of parents requesting Mr. Ferguson grew to almost 60 names.<P>

   ``All I could remember was he made it fun to be a student, and I wanted her to experience that,'' Clarke said.<P>

A day no one forgets<P>

   <P>

   On Dec. 11, when the 1,730 people inside Kensington Park Elementary discovered their loss, the walls of the school practically quivered and caved in.<P>

   His wife's sister called the school at 7 a.m. Both Mr. Ferguson and his second wife, Doris, 36, an aide at Miami's Black Archives, died on their way to his oldest son Keith's wedding. Their youngest children, Christopher and Kendra, both students at Kensington, were unharmed, safe at a relative's house.<P>

   Kensington Principal America Bermudez was driving to work when assistant principal Alice Quarles called her on the cellular phone. ``Don't tell anyone yet,'' Bermudez said. Then she hung up and dialed her region office and its crisis counseling team.<P>

   ``You've got to get to my school,'' she said. ``I don't want mass hysteria.''<P>

   The teachers who knew him best were called to the main office. Smith, the fifth-grade teacher who had known him since they were classmates at Florida A&M, slumped over and fainted. She later fled to Pembroke Lakes Mall in Pembroke Pines, stumbling store to store in a daze, telling any clerk who would listen about Mr. Ferguson.<P>

   Giro, who team-taught with him when she started her career 20 years ago, filled the office with screams. Another teacher sat her down and slapped her face. ``She apologized for hitting me the next day, but I didn't remember it.''<P>

Dealing with the grief<P>

   <P>

   Word leaked out. Physical education teacher Harry Wright, a gruff bear of a man under a baseball cap, staggered back to the sports shelter with eyes red and full. Stephen Newbold, another PE teacher, began praying on the outdoor patio.<P>

   Fifth-grade teacher Gwendolyn Hall dropped to her knees on the dusty ground outside her portable. Slowly, she raised her eyes and looked back at her classroom. The visiting psychologist offered to tell her students.<P>

   ``No, I want to tell my children myself,'' she said. ``I love my kids. I know my kids. I know which ones will be hurting.''<P>

   She faced her class. ``I stood there in front of them and tears started streaming from my eyes. `I don't know how to tell you this . . . ' They said, `Mr. Ferguson? Our  Mr. Ferguson?' The mouths opened, the tears started.''<P>

   Students, feigning tummy aches, called home to tell their parents. Mothers and former students rushed to the school. Amelia Leth's English as a Second Language class played kick ball in PE that day with tears running down their faces.<P>

`A black day'<P>

   <P>

   ``It was like a black day,'' says fifth-grader Sandra Vanegas, who dreamed about Mr. Ferguson and the bright light that night. ``I went home and told my mother. He was her teacher, too. He was like my second father. When you came inside his classroom, you could see you could trust that person. I know nobody is perfect, but there was nothing wrong with him.''<P>

   Slowly, Kensington Park is picking itself back up. Teachers still get goose bumps when they talk about Mr. Ferguson. Students still cry when they mention his name. But they find a strange comfort in dredging up his memory.<P>

   Fourth-grader Ana Balbuena, 10, keeps the tissue she sobbed into that day. In black magic marker, she wrote ``Mr. Ferguson'' over the wrinkles and folded it neatly in her little purse. ``I thought it could be like a souvenir to keep in my heart.''<P>

   More than one student has dreamed about Mr. Ferguson. Many of them talk about seeing a bright light, Mr. Ferguson dressed all in white.<P>

A spring tradition<P>

   <P>

   Kensington Park knew it was spring every year because Mr. Ferguson's class always flew kites. It was a tradition for almost a quarter-century, part science and weather lesson, all fun. If a student couldn't afford to bring one in, Mr. Ferguson helped him make a kite.<P>

   Even when his hair grew peppered with gray, Mr. Ferguson would run with a child's kite to get it up. ``Don't get tangled,'' he yelled to his students. ``Move to the right. Move to the left.''<P>

   So on Friday, 60 kites will fly as the school pays tribute to Mr. Ferguson. Students have been writing poems about kites and their favorite teacher for weeks. They'll recite them, sing El Burrito Sabanero  and the school song.<P>

   A month before Mr. Ferguson died, he tried to calm his students when a cactus in a science project died. ``You must remember this,'' he told them. ``Everything that lives must die.''<P>

   He forgot to mention that memories don't.
