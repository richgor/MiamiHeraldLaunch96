emember when you were 12 with zits but no breasts, shiny braces but dull hair and Mom said, ``No one cares what you look like if you wear a pretty smile.''<P>

 Sure, Mom. That proved as off-the-mark as your other verbal gems:<P>

 No one will buy the cow when the milk is free.<P>

 Get a Ph.D and you'll always have a job.<P>

 If you're nice to people, they'll be nice to you.<P>

 In honor of Mother's Day, we asked local notables to share the best and worst advice mom ever gave them. Then we asked parenting experts how to offer advice in a way that kids today might actually hear what Mom says, though whether they take it or not is another story.<P>

  ``Mom always was an advice giver, I was rarely an advice taker,'' says Howard Finkelstein, 42, Broward County chief assistant public defender. ``From 15 to 35 I knew all the answers. At 35, I realized I didn't even know the questions.''<P>

  A common story. Because what moms (and dads) consider good advice, adolescents consider nagging, irrelevant or downright dumb. Sometimes they're right. But any mom worth her Mother's Day corsage thinks that telling kids what to do is an act of love, as well as her job.<P>

  ``I'm only telling you this for your own good . . . ''<P>

  Remember?<P>

<P>

   So how do you get your message across?<P>

  Start by ditching the notion that handing out advice to adolescents is a selfless act. It isn't. When you tell your daughter you don't think nose piercing is a good idea, there's more to your message than fashion advice. You're exerting control over a kid who's testing her independence. A power struggle is the aftermath.<P>

  Understand this, and you can see why the authoritarian approach reaps more resentment than results, and why you should avoid these common mistakes.<P>

   Some don'ts to avoid<P>

  <LI> Don't say, ``Trust me, I've lived through this and I know what I'm talking about.''<P>

  Setting yourself up as the expert makes your child defensive and gives an underlying message: ``I'm smarter. I'm better,'' says Linda Dunlap, a Parents magazine contributor and head of the psychology department at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.<P>

   That's hardly the path to compliance. Besides, you haven't lived through what your child has.<P>

   ``All our experiences aren't relevant to our children today,'' she says. ``Their access to information is so different from anything we imagined, I'd be careful about the advice I give. They'll be getting it straight from Nobel Peace Prize winners on the World Wide Web.''<P>

  <LI> Don't say, ``You don't want to make the same mistakes I made.''<P>

  Naturally, you want to soften your kid's journey on life's rocky road, up to a point. But adolescence is about making mistakes and learning from them, says Robert Emery, author of Renegotiating Family Relationships (Guilford, $26.95) and a psychology professor at the University of Virginia. Deprive kids of that and you deprive them of becoming self-sufficient.<P>

  <LI> Don't box your children into a corner so they ignore your advice to keep face or assert their independence.<P>

  If you tell your daughter she's throwing her life away on the eighth-grade dropout she's seeing, she'll date him forever. Or worse. If you tell your son he's disgracing his family by even thinking about a tattoo, he'll get two of them. One for each arm.<P>

Change your approach <P>

   None of this means ditching your role as care-taking mom. (You either, Dad.) You do know a thing or too, if only because you've been around longer. But for better results, change your approach, parenting experts suggest. Rather than force-feeding kids, offer sage words like a tasty hors d'oeuvre.<P>

 ``Ask permission to give your opinion and offer it in story form, not as a lecture,'' says Dunlap, the Marist College psychologist. <P>

 Say, for instance, ``Would you like to know what I did?'' Or, ``I had this experience once,'' which shows you remember being 16, heartbroken or confused or madly in love or . . . you-fill-in-the-blank.<P>

 Too touchy-feely? Consider this testimonial.<P>

 Growing up in Miami, clothing designer John Sanchez Haro, 40, remembers his mother, Celaida Sanchez, 62, offering more encouragement than advice.<P>

``There was never any, ` You need to do this. You have to do that,' '' says Sanchez, who credits his mother for helping him find his niche by quietly standing by. <P>

 Because he liked art, his mother paid for classes. When he switched to fashion his senior year, she didn't balk. ``Never did she say, ` All that money for art classes and now you're doing this,' '' he says. ``She said, ` This is your interest, that's fine.' '' <P>

   Accept kids for what they are<P>

   Everyone isn't so lucky. Vanderbilt University family therapist Bettie Ann Spector counseled one young woman whose father had applied to an Ivy League school on her behalf, though she didn't want to go.<P>

  ``I told her if she got accepted, we'd throw a big party -- for her father,'' Spector says. Happily, she didn't get in.<P>

   ``At some point, you need to accept your children for what they are, not for what you want them to be,'' Spector says. <P>

  It also helps to understand that in the long run, your kids learn more from what you do than what you say.<P>

  ``You don't have to give your children lots of advice,'' says Spector, 66, mother of two physicians. ``They learn by how you lead your life.''<P>

 Spector credits her parenting finesse to her mother's low-key approach. Conversely, if Mom shrieked like a banshee, warn your kids to cover their ears.<P>

 Problem is, no matter how much you dislike your mom's methods, you'll follow her footsteps unless you carve a new path. Even then, it's easy to fall back on the familiar.<P>

   ``Lecturing on child development, I'll tell my students what not to do and feel my face turning red because I'm not taking my own advice,'' says Dunlap, the psychology professor. ``I realize at times what a hypocrite I am.''<P>

   Dunlap's mother used the ``compliance through guilt'' approach. As mother of two, 13 and 16, Dunlap occasionally loses her cool and sees history repeat itself, even though she knows better.<P>

   ``Just the other day I said sarcastically, ` Gee, Jason, how nice of you to decide to practice the piano,' '' she says. ``I should have said, ` I'm glad to hear you play. I enjoy your music.' ''<P>

Hard to break<P>

<P>

   So ingrained are parenting routines they're hard to stop, even when your kids aren't kids anymore. Blame it on love, on habit and -- let's be honest -- on the need to control.<P>

   ``As parents, we have a hard time admitting that we've lost control,'' says Dunlap. ``Once that child has wings, he's going to fly the coop and we don't want to let that happen.''<P>

   But the quickest way to drive away older children is with unsolicited advice.<P>

   ``Right into the car with the foot resting hard on the gas pedal,'' Dunlap says. <P>

    When Spector's own children were growing up, her mother gave her advice that she follows to this day: Don't interfere in the lives of your adult children. If your words aren't welcome, your children can exclude you. And you can be pretty miserable alone.<P>

   It's still OK to offer advice to adult kids if they ask for it, parenting experts say. Even so, it's best to soft-pedal your words in story form and throw in plenty of support. <P>

   For instance, couch your advice in telling how you handled, or mishandled, a similar problem. Then add something like: ``You've handled hurdles so well in the past. You're going to be able to figure this out.''<P>

  Clearly, this is easier to write about than to do. How else to explain all the mother-child conflict that's grist for sitcoms and comics?<P>

   Now listen to Fort Lauderdale comedian Anna Collins' routine about a woman searching for a Mother's Day card. The woman asks a clerk: ``Do you have any ` Thank you for undermining me in everything I've ever done and making me feel like I'm totally worthless ' Mother's Day cards?''<P>

   ``Oh, no,'' the clerk answers. ``Those sell out fast.''
