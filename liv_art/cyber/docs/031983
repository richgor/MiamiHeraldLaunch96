<m1>Q. <m2><ql>
<m1> <m0>I would like to know if you can e-mail from a Free-Net service to an online service such as America Online, CompuServe or Prodigy?<ep>
   <m0>(--) B.C., Dade County<m0><qr>

<ql>
<m1>A. <m2><ql>
<m1> <m0>Yes, you can. If you know the person's ID on the online service, you can send e-mail by combining the ID and the name of the service. For instance, if someone's ID on America Online is MaryB, then you would send e-mail to MaryB@aol.com<ep>
   For CompuServe, the ID is always a number separated by a comma. To send e-mail to the person, change the comma to a period and put @CompuServe at the end. So if the ID is 65229,3490, you'd send e-mail to 65229.3490@compuserve.com <ep>
   Prodigy has random letters and numbers for the ID. So if the ID was AD98JJ3, you'd send e-mail to AD98JJ3@prodigy.com <ep>
   You can't see the content on the commercial networks without signing on to them, but you can send e-mail to people on the services and get e-mail from them. You can't participate in chat groups or forums on the commercial services without signing in as a member.<ep>

<m1>Warning!<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   <ep>
   There is a dangerous program being circulated online, on the Internet, on computer bulletin boards and possibly on commercial online services. It's masquerading as a version of one of the most useful programs around. <ep>
   PKZip is a <m1> <m0>program that will compress <m1> <m0>the size of text or a program, making <m1>  <m0>it easier to store and <m1> <m0>to transmit online. <m1> <m0>``Zipped'' (compressed) programs have the ``.zip'' suffix.<ep>
   A new program is being distributed as PKZip 3.0. It's not. If you download it and try to run it, it will destroy files on your computer and possibly cause other damage. The latest legitimate version of PKZip is 2.04g. It's widely available, but make sure you get it from a reliable source. It's shareware, so if you decide to keep it and use it, you should pay to register it (around $30).<ep>
   Do not download PKZip 3.0. <m4>--10.180 inches ( 61p3 )--from start of measuring to here--<m2><ql>
