<m0>   It's really fun watching the incredible explosion of information online.<ep>
   Just a year ago, I told people that the Internet was full of great stuff, but setting out to find <m0>a particular piece<m0>  of information was often fruitless (--) it might not be there and, even if it was, it could be hard to find.<ep>
   But that's changed.<ep>
   Not only has the haystack become gargantuan, but now there's wonderful help in tracking down the needle.<ep>
   For example, my wife and I were talking last weekend about getting some bamboo for our yard and wondering how well it bears transplanting. So I hopped online. Within a minute (--) honestly, just 60 seconds (--) not only did I have tons of information about bamboo in general, I also had a magazine article with a detailed description of transplanting techniques.<ep>
   It's getting difficult to find a subject about which information <m0>isn't  <m0>available online. Increasingly, you may have to pay for that information on the Internet, but it's there (--) and the ratio of free to for-pay is still heavily weighted in favor of us cheapies.<ep>
   There are many, many different tools, engines and robots for scouring the vast world of elec<m2><ql>
<ql>

<m0>tronic information. To find many things (--) say, the home page of a major company or sports team (--) you just make a quick visit to a major online index like Yahoo!<ep>
   But maybe you're looking for something obscure (--) say, information about transplanting bamboo. Then you need to harness all the searching power that's out there. But there are dozens of major Internet search engines these days. So where do you turn?<ep>
<m0>Simple yet sophisticated<ep>
<m0>  <ep>
   To the latest tool: online sites that help you search all the search engines. Some have a list of all the search engines with an entry block to query each one, one at a time. The most sophisticated, though, will let you ask the question only once. They take your search terms and submit them to several search engines, then assemble the replies on one page for you. It's a super-simple way to get at a huge amount of information.<ep>
   A warning, though: If you use these powerful tools for a simple question or a broad topic (--) such as ``financial info'' (--) you'll get so many responses you'll be overwhelmed. Best to stick to simple topical indexes here.<ep>
   <ep>
   One of the most impressive of these super-search engines is a South Florida creation called All4One. It uses the most impressive implementation of Netscape frames I've seen. It allows the computer screen to be divided into several separate sections (--) like a television that lets you put a little picture of a different channel in the corner of the screen.<ep>
   When you search, your query goes out to four of the major search engines. It puts the response from each of those engines in a separate frame on your screen. It looks cool, and it's pretty easy to use.<ep>
   But Netscape frames are a tool that only Netscape Navigator 2.0 software supports. So All4One only works if you have Navigator 2.0.<ep>
<m0>Which fits your needs?<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   Another tool that lets you use one request for several engines is Yahoo! After you search Yahoo! and get the responses from there, you also get a list of major search engines. If you click on any of those, it automatically submits your request and brings back the answer. It's an easy way to pick which engines you like but only have to make the request once.<ep>
   There's a similar tool called SavvySearch. It submits your request automatically to more than a dozen separate engines and brings back results. It also suggests strategies for where else to turn. This is what got me the instant pointer to the facts on bamboo transplanting.<ep>
   Another place to turn in your search for information: IBM recently opened InfoMarket, which offers a wider variety of information sources than just Web pages and Internet discussion groups. InfoMarket also searches many publications, newsletters, magazines and corporate data-sites. It lets you check off which spots you want to include in the search. You'll have to pay to see some of the answers, such as articles from some magazines.<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Perhaps the most exhaustive list of search engines is at All-In-One. It lists 41 search tools just for the World Wide Web. There are other specialized search options for ``News/Weather,'' ``Technical,'' ``People'' and other subjects. But you have to type your search words separately for each spot.<ep>
   The beauty of all these tools is that you can feel in command of the online world, rather than dwarfed by its vastness.<ep>
   Try a few of these super-sites. When you figure out which one feels comfortable to you, you'll be a lot closer to mastering the Internet.<ql>
