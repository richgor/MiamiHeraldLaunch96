   It's Saturday Night! Well, almost (--) it is the year of the Presidential elections, <m1> <m0>and what better way to deal with them than with humor?<ep>
   <m0>Saturday Night Live Goes Political<m0> <m0> features the greatest moments from 20 years of <m0>SNL<m0> political satire, captured in nearly 300 full-motion video clips of classic SNL moments.<ep>
   The vast SNL archives were searched to bring us such favorites as Phil Hartman as Clinton and Reagan; Chris Farley as Gingrich; Dana Carvey as Bush and Perot; Dan Aykroyd as Nixon, Carter and Dole; Chevy Chase as Ford; John Belushi as Kissinger; Gilda Radner as Baba Wawa; and many more.<ep>
   Features include:<ep>
   <m0>(box) Presidents:<m0> 20 years of the presidency from Nixon to Clinton.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Politicians:<m0> All the famous and infamous politicians.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Elections:<m0> Debates, parodies of TV ads and more.<ep>
   <m0>(box) The World: <m0>Global politics from Idi Amin to Boris Yeltsin.<ep>
   <m0>(box) The Press:<m0> Emily Litella, Baba Wawa, Mr. Subliminal and others.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Games:<m0> Four very funny arcade-style games such as a Pac-Man-like game where you must satisfy Clinton's hunger for burgers and fries as he follows the road to the White House, or help Gingrich pass as many bills as possible in the fast-paced Newt's House; plus 12 puzzles and other diversions.<ep>
