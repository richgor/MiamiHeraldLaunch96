<m0>   These are the addresses for super-search engines that help you query a variety of search tools online:<ep>
   <ep>
   <m0>(box) Search.com<ep>
<m0>  <m0> http://www.search.com/<m0><ep>
   Operated by the people at C/Net, whose main site at <m0>http://www.cnet.com<m0> has lots of excellent information. This presents you with several search engines and other choices, but you have to enter your search terms individually for each one.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) Easypage (--) All4One<ep>
<m0>   <m0>http://easypage.com/all4one<ep>
<m0>   Created in South Florida, it's a very sophisticated use of Netscape Navigator frames. Automatically submits your request to four search engines and puts all of the responses on the screen at once. Must have Netscape Navigator 2.0 to use it. Easy to use.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) SavvySearch<ep>
<m0>   <m0>http://numan.cs.colostate.edu:1969/form<ep>
<m0>   Searches more than a dozen engines with one request. Can take a long time and can be too busy to accept your search at times.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) All-In-One<ep>
<m0>  <m0> http://www.albany.net/allinone/<ep>
<m0>   Been around the longest of the search-everything pages. Easy-to-use interface.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) IBM InfoMarket<ep>
<m0>   <m0>http://www.infomkt.ibm.com<ep>
<m0>   You can pick from all kinds of different information sources: newsletters, databases, registrations, magazines and more. Sometimes, you have to pay to see the full text of an article. It's fast, but the results can be cryptic.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) Yahoo!<ep>
<m0>  <m0> http://www.yahoo.com<ep>
   <m0>You can search Yahoo!'s index of pages. With the results, you get a list of other major search engines. Just click on one of them, and it submits the search for you and you get the answer back.<ql>
