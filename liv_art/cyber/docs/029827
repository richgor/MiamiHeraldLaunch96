    If you enjoy the writings of Jules Verne and J.R.R. Tolkien, you'll enjoy the magic of <m0>Dinotopia: Living the Adventure CD-ROM<m0>, which is based on James Gurney's 1992 book <m0>Dinotopia: A World Apart<m0> .<ep>
  This CD-ROM version <m1> <m0>offers a superb excursion into a fabulous realm where humans and dinosaurs live together in harmony. The game lures players into a journey of discovery in a majestic new world.<ep>
  <m0>Dinotopia  <m0>combines special effects puppetry with enriched 3-D graphics animation and blue-screen technology featuring live actors with nonviolent action.<ep>
   Test your skills through interaction with dinosaurs and humans. Experience new worlds, learn a new language, create musical melodies, play card games, solve intricate puzzles and navigate a submarine through an underwater world.<ep>
   Plot: 17-year-old twins, Nathan <m1> <m0>and Constance, are separated after their ship sinks during a storm. Nathan finds himself washed up on a beach, but Constance is nowhere to be found.<ep>
   As Nathan wanders into the rain forest, he discovers a civilization of living dinosaurs and humans. Making his way to the Dinotopian city of Volcaneum, Nathan finds his sister's locket being used as a prize in an intricate card game. Nathan joins the game, wins the locket <m1> <m0>and begins his quest for Constance.<ep>
    <m0>Dinotopia<m0>  works better under real DOS; when running under Windows 95 you might find in rare cases that your PC locks up. If it does, click on your MS-DOS icon for the game and go to the Properties folder, then check where it says ``DOS will not detect Windows.'' This should work.<ep>
  If you need game hints, get <m0>Dinotopia: The Official Strategy Guide  <m0>($16.99) from Prima Publishing; for more information call (800) 294-0022. <m1> <m0>Web address: <m0>http://www.turner.com/dinotopia<ql>
