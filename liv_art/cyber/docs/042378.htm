find the title of those Computers for Dummies books vaguely insulting, but they're good books and very popular. Computers have such a history of being unfathomably technical that many people claim utter ignorance proudly.<P>

   Those are the people CompuServe is targeting with its heavily advertised new online service: WOW! It integrates a bright and simple online service with Internet access. Unlike Prodigy, America Online and old-fashioned CompuServe, it works purely on a fixed monthly charge ($17.95) with no additional hourly rates.<P>

   It could be called Online for Dummies.<P>

   ``This is not a service for the power user,'' said Lex Crosett, WOW! vice president for technical development, in a tad of an understatement. ``The focus here is on the home user, the family user, the first-time user. It's completely and entirely automatic.''<P>

   The screen has brilliant colors in cartoony designs recalling Roy Lichtenstein. But it doesn't have the screentop menu bar with drop-down menus of Macintosh or Microsoft Windows. WOW! is shooting for customers who have not become used to a computer screen.<P>

   ``We tested many prototypes with naive users,'' Crosett said. ``The conventions of cascading windows and about 70 items on the screen to choose from overwhelm many people.''<P>

   He said the design mimics the number of choices you get using a video game, a television or a remote control. There's never a huge variety of options. <P>

   For instance, the main menu offers only five ``hubs'' to choose from: Living, Sports, Money, Entertainment and Customer Services. Within each you find ``communities,'' such as Travel or Celebrities or Basketball or Films.<P>

   Once inside any community, you always get the same six choices -- shopping, Internet, news, chat, messaging, reference -- laid out in a circle of buttons designed to look like POGs. There's a splashy box in the middle labeled ``What's New!''<P>

   If you go into any area, often you'll get only one item, not the huge number of choices offered by most online services.<P>

   ``The people we're targeting don't want that depth and breadth,'' said WOW! spokesperson Debra Young. ``On WOW!, you're only going to find 240 places to go, not 3,000.''<P>

   Crosett, the vice president, summed up WOW!'s goal: ``Minimize time spent, maximize value.''<P>

   But one problem in minimizing time spent on the service, which just started a month ago, is that it's still terribly slow, even when you're using a 28.8 kbps modem. Crosett said the company is bringing on more computers and shifting resources to match the spots customers are using most. ``We are adding capacity rapidly,'' he said.<P>

   In many ways, WOW! creates good first impressions, but some spots haven't been smoothed out yet.<P>

   The program arrives on a CD-ROM meant to be automatically recognized by Windows 95. That means you just pop in the disk and watch the welcome and installation screen appear automatically. <P>

   Yes, I said Windows 95 on purpose -- the program only runs on Windows 95. Since the system requires a minimum 486 computer with 8 megabytes of RAM, a CD-ROM and a sound card, Crosett said the developers figured almost everyone meeting the criteria would be running Windows 95. A Macintosh version is expected late this year. There won't be any Windows 3.1 version.<P>

   Unfortunately, on my computer, the Windows 95 ``autoplay'' feature for recognizing the CD-ROM didn't kick in -- so nothing happened. (The disk doesn't come with instructions for what to do in that situation, so here's what to do: From the Start button, go to Run. Type in ``d:\install\setup.exe'' and hit enter. That assumes your CD-ROM is drive ``d:'' -- use whatever letter stands for the CD-ROM drive on your computer.)<P>

   Once the program started, I got a nice video of a woman explaining the service and system. The installation went smoothly.<P>

   When I asked to connect, I was impressed to get spoken guidance. But it was the last spoken instruction I got -- which was disappointing. Crosett said more multimedia features will be added. <P>

   Every selection opens a new window and closes the previous one, so you can never do more than one thing at a time. You also can't resize the windows or arrange them on your screen. Crosett said these simplifications appeal to ``naive users.''<P>

   Some content was disappointing. I went into the reference area for maps and saw a listing for a map for Fort Lauderdale. When I chose it, I was shocked to see a map of Florida with a big dot on the southeast corner labeled ``Fort Lauderdale.''<P>

   Some content isn't there at all yet. The Newsstand is still empty. When I went into Baseball looking for Wednesday-night scores, the feature news story and picture was a preview of a Monday game two nights before. <P>

   I also had some technical problems. After about two hours of use, I got a Windows 95 warning message that my hard drive, which had 65 megabytes of space free when I started, was almost full. More than 50 megabytes had been eaten up with temporary storage in less than two hours -- something I've never experienced in 10 months of using Windows 95.<P>

   Crosett said all images used by WOW! come in compressed format and have to be uncompressed to be shown, so each image is much larger once it's open. Once opened, they sit as temporary files, taking up space. Once you leave WOW!, the files are removed, so the storage is not taken permanently.<P>

   Also, I got a lot of disconnections. The system would try to reconnect, and sometimes succeeded. Crosett said disconnections should be rare and the re-connect feature should prevent problems.<P>

   The program comes with Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which isn't any special bargain since Microsoft gives it away. It's a simplified version without many regular features, such as showing you the address where you are, letting you change typeface preferences or allowing you to turn off graphics to move more quickly online. <P>

   The children's version of WOW! -- which features goofy big-toothed cartoon characters -- limits where kids can go. I couldn't get to Playboy, which wasn't surprising, but I also couldn't get to the Yahoo! online index, or The New York Times online, or The Herald's HeraldLink, or MCA Universal Pictures online. I couldn't find any address online that I could type in that would be accepted.<P>

   Crosett said the service selected appropriate sites for youngsters and doesn't allow spots that might have links to inappropriate places.<P>

   ``We actively review sites, and have accepted sites and excluded sites,'' he said. ``We take the time editorially to not only look for bad stuff, but inappropriate stuff.<P>

   ``Although I love The New York Times and grew up reading it, there are parts of it I would not want my 8-year-old to see. You should be able to put any 8- to 12-year-old in front of WOW! and walk away.''<P>

   A version of the program for teenagers is scheduled to ship this summer.<P>

   I'm sure WOW!'s special simplification will appeal to a lot of people, but I hope WOW! smooths out the glitches so that everything matches the thought and care put into the video introduction and opening screens.<P>

   The first 30 days are free, so you can decide whether it's right for you without risk.<P>
