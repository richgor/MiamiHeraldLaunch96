   <m0>Goldilocks and the Three Bears<m0> and <m0>Little Red Riding Hood<m0> are two new interactive adaptations of the famous Brothers Grimm stories, from Packard Bell Interactive.<ep>
   These animated storybooks can help develop an early love for reading and an array of other important skills.<ep>
     Designed for children ages 4-9, the CD-ROMs have hundreds of animated areas allowing your child to interact by using the computer mouse. Each includes an original musical score with sing-along features.<ep>
     To <m1> <m0>provide a jump on preschool skills, the CD-ROMs have skill-building games and activities that teach literacy, counting, creativity and more. Games and activities such as coloring and dot-to-dots are designed to help build strong creative abilities and vivid imaginations. <m1> <m0>Children can print out black and white outlines of any page and create their own coloring books. Or they can color the ``live'' animations on the screen and print them out in color, if you have a color printer. The games and skill-building activities can keep kids engaged for hours.<ep>
   The CD will also play <m1> <m0>on your home or car audio CD player; you can hear the story and soundtrack. The program <m1>   <m0>comes with a bound copy of the original storybook, so kids can hear the stories from Mom and Dad at bedtime (--) no computer required.<ep>
 Other titles from Packard Bell Interactive are <m0>The Little Engine, Dinosaur in the Garden <m0>and <m0>Milly Fitzwilly's Mouse Center.<ep>
