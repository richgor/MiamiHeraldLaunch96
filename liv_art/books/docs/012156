<m0>   <m0>The Seven League Boots<m0>  is the final segment of Albert Murray's calling card in fiction, a remarkable trilogy that details the coming-of-age of a young black man in Alabama in the 1940s.<ep>
   In time-stopping narration and near stream-of-consciousness thought, it follows <m0>Train WhistleGuitar<m0>  and <m0>The Spyglass Tree<m0>. The final volume takes Scooter out of college and into an Ellington-esque big band. Scooter is taking a year as a troubadour to save money for graduate school, which is, to him, the means to gain the ``seven-league stride of the heroes in rocking chair times.''<ep>
<m1>Success and glamor<ep>
<m0>   He goes from a rural college band directly into the fictional peer of the Ellington Orchestra and doesn't break a sweat. He leaves the band to stay in Hollywood as a session musician, at which he is, of course, wildly successful. Meanwhile, he is courted by a glamorous film star. <ep>
   If this is larger than life, well, so is Murray. Few top him at writing about the essence of blues and jazz. A big-band recording session sounds like this:<ep>
   ``Then there was only time enough for one more. So he winked at everybody else and gave a signifying nod in my direction and began with a down-home meeting-bell vamp as if to sic the whole band on me. Not to make me hustle and strut my stuff but in a medium church rocking bounce so that all I had to do was keep time and listen to the ensembles coming sometimes as if from the Amen corner and sometimes as if from the congregation at large and as if invoking and also responding to a big blooping tenor sax sermon by Herman Kemble, a short deaconlike baritone prayer by Ted Chandler followed by two thirty-two-bar choruses of very elegant riff shouting and carrying on after which the bossman, Joe States and Wayman Ridgeway, got their little licks in before Scully Pittman took it up into the choir chancel from which Ike Ellis pushed it on out through the stained-glass windows and into orbit.''<ep>
   That, ladies and gentlemen, is music, and that is writing.<ep>
<m1>Left wondering<ep>
<m0>   All of which makes it bittersweet when Scooter finally boards a flight back home to Gasoline Point. Like him, we are left wondering whether his girlfriend will be waiting for him, and what will happen to him next.<ep>
   What we do know is that Murray's trilogy will stand as a startlingly evocative series of novels about life in the United States in the first half of the century. To call it simply Southern writing or black writing is condescending and beside the point. Murray's books, like the best fiction, simply are. Adjectives come after the fact.<ep>
