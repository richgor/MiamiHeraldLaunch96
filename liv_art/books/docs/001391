    Herein the beautiful blarney and profound feelings we've come to expect from William Kennedy, the Homer of Albany. But this time the characters are not as interestingly grooved, scarred and faceted as his usual Phelans and Quinns. <m4>Kennedy<m2><ql>
<m0>Either that or this is his <m0>Old Man and the Sea, <m0>his <m0>Goodbye, Columbus, <m0>his <m0>Great Gatsby, <m0>his one 50,000-word masterpiece, and I fail to see it.<ep>
    Traditionally, Kennedy's fiction (--) <m0>Ironweed, Legs, Billy Phelan's Greatest Game, Quinn Game <m0>(--) is full of contrasts. Characters are church-crazed but raucous, ethical but corrupt. Immigrants are in touch with the power of the local political machine. And however marginal Kennedy's people are, haunted by the past, afraid of the future, they remain life-embracing.<ep>
    All these conflicting elements are apparent in <m0>The Flaming Corsage, <m0>but the characters lack dimension. There are wonderful scenes, great moments that float off the page, but too often the people are not compelling.<ep>
<m1>Woman in a mask<ep>
<m0>   The book begins in 1908 with a scene that easily could have been written for the stage. A woman wearing a green velvet cloak and a matching mask is in a hotel room with a man and woman in evening dress. A second man enters the room, shoots the cloaked figure directly in the heart, shoots the other man, then kills himself.<ep>
    Then Kennedy flashes back 23 years and across town to the state fair in Albany where competing reporters Edward Daugherty and Thomas Maginn file their stories and go off to the prostitutes' tents at the edge of the fairgrounds seeking recreation.<ep>
   Daugherty and Maginn both have literary ambitions. Daugherty has written a novel about Irish convict laborers who decide to risk Yellow Fever digging the Erie Canal rather than rot in prison. Maginn writes criticism for The Atlantic Monthly.<ep>
   Daugherty stands astride two classes. ``I'm not against radicalism,'' the universal young idealist tells his father, Emmett. ``But I want to get beyond it. I want to get over the past and live in a world where people aren't always at each other's throats.'' Emmett saved the life of mill owner Lyman Fitzgibbon during a labor riot. The grateful Fitzgibbon made Edward his godson, paying for a private-school education and granting him an annuity that permits him to live more comfortably than his newspaper colleagues. He and Lyman's granddaughter Katerina fall in love, and marry despite the disapproval of both families.<ep>
<m1>A ballroom party<ep>
<m0>    Edward becomes a successful playwright. And eight years after his marriage he gives a grand dinner in a ballroom lined with pictures of notable guests of the city's grand hotel: Abraham Lincoln, Jenny Lind, P.T. Barnum, Boss Tweed, Oscar Wilde and other representatives of forces that insure people will always be at each other's throats. Between the oyster course and the lobster gratine(acu)e Edward presents his father-in-law with ownership papers to a racing horse, his mother-in-law a black sealskin coat. He pins a violet corsage on Katerina's gown.<ep>
    The hotel is on fire. As they escape, Katerina's breast is pierced with a burning ember. Her sister leaps from a ladder to the street, rupturing her spleen. A week later she is dead. Two months later, so is her father.<ep>
    ``Death is venerable,'' observes Katerina. ``You can always count on death.'' She turns their home into a shrine, portraits of dead ancestors, her father's clock permanently fixed at the minute the burning sliver pierced her flesh. Half in love with melancholy, she blames Edward for the deaths of her sister and father.<ep>
<m1>Fate, time and myth<ep>
<m0>      There is something of Greek tragedy in the way Edward is brought down at the height of accomplishment, the way adventuresome, impulsive Katerina turns inward. But Kennedy has always been interested in the intertwining of fate, time and myth, the ability of families simultaneously to scar and to nurture. He isn't given to dangling a story from a lone theme such as hubris, isn't given to making single portentous statements.<ep>
      Still, <m0>The Flaming Corsage  <m0>is a fine book, if not up to Kennedy's standards. Had it been published under someone else's name, it would deservedly be praised for its wondrous prose and rascal humor, for the vivid evocation of the struggle between the working class Edward comes from and the establishment embodied by Katerina's family, for its sense of place and wonder. <m1> <ql>
