<m0>   The dazzling short-story collection <m0>In a Father's Place  <m0>established Christopher Tilghman as an important presence in American fiction. Six years later, Tilghman has reconfirmed his early promise with one of the most poignant, evocative, beautifully written novels this reader has come across in years.<ep>
   <m0>Mason's Retreat  <m0>unfolds on Maryland's Eastern Shore just before the outbreak of World War II. The story of the Mason's family's move from England in 1936 to the thousand-acre Retreat, ``a black hulk of a family ruin,'' is told by grandson Harry Mason, who imagines their heart-wrenching tale ``across the breach of sixty years.'' Harry learns about The Retreat, ``overgrown and shuttered, a closed eye on the shoreline, a dark memory at night,'' from his father, Simon, a youngster of 6 during the novel's main story. In the decades since his brother's early death, Simon ``has put many spins on his family history, like a screenwriter . . . <m1> <m0>pitching a story line: deep, dark tragedy in the crucible of the nation; a romantic tale about a waning era; gritty collision of race and class.''<ep>
<m1>Leaving England<ep>
<m0>   As the novel begins, Edith and Edward Mason are sailing across the Atlantic, leaving an expatriate life in England, ``fresh, unmarred faces in a land whose people were still exhausted by the Great War,'' after 13 somewhat unsuccessful years. Edward, a philanderer and failed factory owner, is ``performing damage control on his dreams,'' hoping the move back to America might offer a much-needed reversal of fortune, and perhaps rekindle his wife's love. ``That was what he needed so badly, that was what he was asking for, those moments of refuge in the kindness of her heart.''<ep>
   We experience the overbearing but well-meaning Edward through the sensibilities of his wife and two sons, and finally, his grandson. Edith, ``a woman who knows some of the costs of life,'' who has long been conscripted into ``the sisterhood of loss,'' realizes her husband has always been ``a candle burning in his younger son's heart, a black void in his older son's soul.'' Even in his absence, Edward exists for her ``as the judge and arbiter of everything she has ever done . . . revolving around them . . . <m1> <m0>like the moon, waxing and waning, whether any of them liked it or not.''<ep>
<m1>Given up hope<ep>
<m0>   Her grandson envisions the lonely but resourceful Edith as a woman who ``survived her adult life thus far because she has given up trying to believe and has settled for supposing; she has given up hope and consoled herself with waiting,'' that is, until the blundering Edward, ``playing cat and mouse with the possible outbreak of war,'' returns for a year to England to revitalize his factory, which makes airplane parts, leaving Edith and their sons behind. Edith and Sebastien blossom; Simon pines for his adored father, mired in ``the shadowy world of adult delays and excuses''.<ep>
   Tilghman masterfully portrays the transformation of the restless, brooding 14-year-old Sebastien, who finds a kindred spirit in Robert, his family's hired help. For Sebastien, ``life had been tinted by one vague but always present hope: that he would grow up enough before his father lost everything.'' His friendship with Robert, he realizes, precludes knowing about Robert's private life or past. ``There were so many secrets (--) not just Robert's, but secrets the black women kept, silencing each other in glances. It was as if he and the Retreat were floating on an ocean of Negro truths and if he fell in, he might drown.''<ep>
<m1>The place's curse<ep>
<m0>   Sebastien's attachment to the Retreat is as profound as his father's disgust with it. Edward feels mocked by the dead Mason faces on the wall's portraits; the place seems to him ``a trap, a spider web, a curse.'' When the newly confident, temporarily successful Edward decides the family must return to Europe, Sebastien's plan to stay behind backfires, causing the calamity that looms over this shattering novel.<ep>
   Penetrating deeply into the souls of his fictive creations, Tilghman deftly exposes the conflicts, disappointments, tension and betrayals that gnaw at the frayed lives of so many families, whose unhappiness or bad fortune affect all who live in their orbit (--) friends, lovers, employees and, finally, their own haunted descendants.<ql>
