<m0>   In 1958, Joseph Cullman III took the helm at Philip Morris and proclaimed, ``The health scare is receding (--) the worst is over.'' It wasn't. It isn't. The health risks of tobacco have since been established. And every day seems to bring new attacks on the corporate fortress as ever-more-damaging internal documents leak from the once-watertight industry. <ep>
   Richard Kluger, whose book <m0>Simple Justice  <m0>depicted the sweep of the civil rights movement, has now taken on another great American movement: the war on tobacco. <m0>Ashes to Ashes,<m0> at nearly 800 pages, is by no means a quick read. But it's lively, entertaining and awesomely comprehensive, which makes it an essential book for anyone who wants to understand our nation's love-hate relationship with tobacco.<ep>
<m1>Everything is here<ep>
<m0>   Kluger puts everything in, giving the reader history, science, culture and politics in alternating bites. He evokes nostalgia in describing the marketing wars between such hoary brands as Old Gold, Pall Mall and Luckies (``Call-l-l-l for-r-r-r Philip Maw-reeeees!''). He details ineffective government attempts at regulation, generations of spurious health claims and deceptive advertising (--) and lovingly describes Humphrey Bogart's expressiveness with a smoke in <m0>Casablanca:<m0><ep>
   ``In that hand and in his mouth, the cigarette became endowed with a kind of ironic nobility as Bogart used it to make a moral statement about a world gone awry <m1> <m0>. . . <m1> <m0>his every considered drag and expelled puff of smoke seemed to represent a mocking laugh of bitter defiance.''<ep>
   Kluger explains how the creation of the mass-market cigarette and cigars whose smoke could be drawn deep into the lungs (--) made for ``the truest, cheapest, most accessible opiate of the masses,'' which in turn led to this century's awesome rise in deaths from tobacco-related lung cancer, heart disease and other ills. At the same time, he gives the reader a sense of the romance of cigarette leaves: Burley, dark and harsh but receptive to such flavorings as chocolate and licorice that can be whiffed at the opening of a fresh pack; lighter, milder Bright leaf, and exotic Latakia and other varieties.<ep>
   But Kluger also gets down to business, charting the rise of the major tobacco companies and their brands (--) and the inevitable lawsuits against them. Kluger focuses especially on <m4>Kluger<m2><ql>
<m0>the pivotal trial by relatives of smoker Rose Cipollone, the liability suit against tobacco companies that brought to light many of the documents that make up the foundation of the book.<ep>
   He clearly came to hate the companies he wrote about (--) though Kluger isn't happy with many lawmakers or anti-tobacco activists, either. ``The question, then,'' he asks in introducing the book, ``is whether cigarette merchants are businessmen basically like any other, selling a product judged to be highly hazardous long after its usefulness to millions was well established, and are now sorely abused by `health fascists' and moralizing busybodies, or are they moral lepers preying on the ignorant, the miserable, the emotionally vulnerable, and constitutionally susceptible?'' His detailed descriptions of tobacco companies' disingenuous attempts to counter the growing mountain of data on smoking's health risks leaves little doubt that Kluger takes the latter view.<ep>
<m1>Solid reporting<ep>
<m0>   Such tendentiousness couldn't stand up without a foundation of solid reporting, and the quality of Kluger's work astonishes throughout: He actually persuaded many top tobacco executives and researchers to talk with him.<ep>
   Kluger finally wraps up <m0>Ashes to Ashes  <m0>with a grand plan to settle the tobacco wars by getting Congress to grant the industry protection from legal liability in exchange for the industry's voluntarily acceding to regulation.<ep>
   Fascinating, but unlikely to happen on our planet. Still, anyone who can pull off this awesome feat of reporting as history deserves a little room to rant.<ql>
