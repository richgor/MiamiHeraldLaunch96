<m0>   Present-day expressions of anti-Semitism by some blacks falsify the story of black-Jewish relations and, in so doing, obliterate memory. In <m0>The Temple Bombing,<m0> Melissa Fay Greene seeks to restore memory before it's too late.<ep>
   She revisits the '50s, when Southern Jews, most of whom were descendants of Jewish Southerners, thought of themselves as Southerners first and Jews hardly at all. This mindset was especially true for the Jews of Atlanta, who were still traumatized by the 1915 lynching of Leo Frank, a member of the Temple, that city's Reform synagogue. Accusing him of the murder of Mary Phagan, a 13-year-old employee of the pencil factory of which he was part owner, a mob lynched Frank.<ep>
   David Marx, rabbi of the Temple, responded to the lynching by urging members of his congregation to hide their Jewish identities. In 1946, when Jacob Rothschild succeeded Marx as rabbi, he found a congregation whose ``protective coloration was so far advanced that few truly Jewish elements remained. . . .'' <ep>
<m1>Like Nazi laws<ep>
<m0>   The segregation of the South reminded Rothschild of Nazi laws against Jews. His sermons began to run to ``the Negro question'' and the injustice of segregation. <ep>
   Members of the Temple were, for the most part, unresponsive to Rothschild's sermons, especially after 1954, when homemade bombs began destroying Southern churches and synagogues. Between 1954 and 1959, 10 percent of all such bombings targeted Jews; on the morning of Oct. 12, 1958, it was the Temple's turn. The bombing of Atlanta's oldest and richest synagogue shattered the city's comfortable illusions about race relations, and rattled the complacency of the Jews who had masked their identities for so long. <ep>
   Members of the anti-Semitic National States' Rights Party were arrested and tried for the bombing. However, the evidence to convict was insufficient and not-guilty verdicts were returned.<ep>
<m1>Too much detail<ep>
<m0> In <m0>The Temple Bombing, <m0>Greene dilutes her story by relating too much detail. She interviewed all the principals or their widows, including the men arrested for the bombing; some of this material is tedious and repetitious. And too much space is devoted to verbatim transcripts from the trials. <ep>
   There are also several lapses of judgment, as when Greene writes that ``in some respects, the Brown decision actually slowed the progress that was quietly being made.'' This was the official Southern ``line'' of the time and it is surprising to see it repeated 40 years later as fact. <ep>
   Despite these shortcomings, this is an important book that revives a pivotal time and place in Southern history. Rabbi Rothschild's story deserves, as Greene puts it, ``to be rescued from the collective historical amnesia.''<ep>
