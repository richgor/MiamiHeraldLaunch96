<m0> Anyone who crawls even briefly into the pages of Antonia Susan Byatt's fiction cannot help but conclude that he is in the presence of a deep heart and supple mind. Byatt (--) best known to U.S. readers for <m0>Possession: A Romance, <m0>her 1990 Booker Prize-winning novel that spliced parodies of Victorian literature into a contemporary romantic mystery (--) is the most admirable sort of polymath: meditative yet enthralled by the hum and grind of life, critical yet empathic, universal yet specific, emotionally direct yet intellectually playful.<ep>
   <m0>Babel Tower  <m0>is a great, big sweep of a story, broad yet densely compacted. It is the third installment of a planned tetralogy about the political and social evolutions of ``the new Elizabethan age.'' With her senses honed to register the telling details of the day (--) the length of a hemline, the sleekness of a haircut, the aptness of an <m0>entrecote sauce bernaise <m0>(--) Byatt cannily explores the various ways in which freedom, language, faith, learning, communication, censorship, forgiveness and love stretch and constrict us all. Her book gives both pause and pleasure.<ql>
<m1>Frederica returns <ep>
<m0>   Like its predecessors <m0>The Virgin in the Garden <m0>(1978) and <m0>Still Life <m0>(1985), <m0>Babel Tower  <m0>focuses on Frederica Potter, the younger daughter of an atheist educator and his pale, quiet wife. It is 1964, the era of the Bomb, the Beatles, <m0>Silent Spring, <m0>the Gulf of Tonkin, Courreges miniskirts, the John Profumo/Christine Keeler scandal and the death of God. <m1> <m0>Six years earlier, as <m0>Still Life's <m0>readers will recall with a little shudder, Frederica's sister Stephanie had been electrocuted in her own kitchen by an improperly grounded refrigerator as she tried to rescue a trapped sparrow. <m1> <m0>``She thought, as the pain ran through her, as her arm, fused to the metal, burned and banged, as her head filled, `This is it,' and then, <m1> <m0>. . . <m1> <m0>dark pain, and more pain.''<ep>
   The tragedy had been a smashup for everyone: Stephanie's husband, Daniel Orton, had fled his clergyman's post for the dark corners of the soul, leaving his two young children in the care of his wife's parents. <m1> <m0>Stephanie's brother Marcus, who had watched his sister die, is marked forever by the knowledge that he did not (--) could not? (--) save her. Frederica, who had been such a smart, luminous thing at Cambridge, simply dropped from sight and into the arms of Nigel Reiver, a wealthy young businessman whose dark otherness had provided unexpected comfort in her grief.<ep>
 But now on this fine fall morning, Frederica's old poet friend Hugh Pink is ambling through the Herefordshire woodlands and thinking of pomegranates when he hears a <m4>Byatt<m2><ql>
<m0>familiar voice calling his name. Frederica is standing by a stile in boots, jodhpurs and jacket and with a scarf tied around her head ``in the style of the Queen and her royal sister.'' At her side is a little boy.<ep>
 Hugh knows Frederica is married. ``He remembers the buzz of furious gossip and chatter at the time. . . . <m1> <m0>Someone nobody <m0>knew, <m0>they had said, they had complained, none of her old friends, a stranger, a dark horse. No one was invited to the wedding, none of her university lovers or gossips, they had found out purely by chance, she had suddenly vanished, or so they told each other, with variants, with embellishments. It was put about that this man kept her more or less locked up, more or less incommunicado, in a moated grange, would you believe, in the country, in outer darkness.''<ep>
<m1>No words from Nigel<ep>
<m0>   The rumors are not far off. Nigel is a brooding, dangerous man resentful of his wife's old attachments and intellectual passions but unable to offer anything to replace them. ``Nigel has no words,'' the unhappy Frederica tells herself, ``and I cannot do without them.''<ep>
 Frederica had married Nigel ``because Stephanie had married Daniel, and is dead.'' Her body responds to him, but her heart does not. That belongs to the couple's small son, Leo. <m1> <m0>``She knows every hair on his head, every inch of his body, every word, she thinks, of his vocabulary, even though he is constantly proving her wrong. <m1> <m0>And he has ruined her life, she thinks . . . I would walk out tomorrow if it were not for Leo, she tells herself hundreds of times each day, with contempt and puzzlement.''<ep>
 Yet, these are the Swinging Sixties, the liberation decade, and when Nigel's temper flares so hot that there are bruises and blood, Frederica (--) in a heart-stopping scene (--) at last flees to the city with her son. With her friends' help, she finds work as a book critic and part-time lecturer in literature, engages a divorce lawyer and tries to find her stride: ``Bookshops. <m1> <m0>Vegetable litter from the market. Election posters. London. <m1> <m0>Life. <m1> <m0>. . . <m1>  <m0>I shall have to get my hair cut, she thinks, looking keenly at passers-by.''<ep>
   There is something simultaneously admirable and appalling about Frederica, about her unrelenting curiosity, her self-conscious motherhood, her silly snobberies, and in her Byatt gives us an almost flawless portrait of a modern, coherent, conflicted woman forced to stand watching, hands clamped to her sides, as her world flies apart. <m1> <m0>``She is afraid of divorce which will free her, as she was not afraid of marriage, which trapped her.''<ep>
   At the heart of <m0>Babel Tower  <m0>simmer two court battles: Frederica's divorce and custody fight for Leo and an even more engrossing obscenity trial involving <m0>Babbletower, <m0>a fantasy novel written by the obscure Jude Mason, a brilliant, almost sanctimoniously squalid Nietzschean scholar who supports himself by posing nude for art students at the same college at which Frederica teaches.<ep>
<m1>Fretting about snails<ep>
<m0>   In a technique familiar to her readers, Byatt inserts into Frederica's story slices of Jude's book (--) the saga of a community that aspires to the ideals of freedom and choice but is doomed by the usual human tendencies toward greed and license. We also get parts of a Hobbit-like fairy tale, Frederica's own scattered efforts to produce a book of stories and musings, and a wonderfully snide and stuffy subplot about a government commission's attempts to study the way English is being taught in England's schools. Characters from the two earlier books appear to play their neat, expected roles. Various towers loom importantly. Anthony Burgess is heard from, as is a rock group called Zag and the Szyzgy Zy-Goats. There are side trips into E.M. Forster, William Blake and D.H. Lawrence. Hugh Pink finishes his pomegranate poem. There is quite a lot of fretting about snails.<ep>
 When she first lands in London, Frederica finds work reading and reporting on new manuscripts for a publisher. Most of the manuscripts she slogs through are rot, but one novel about a bread-obsessed clergyman's wife ``made me feel that the English language can say things, deep, funny, difficult things.'' With <m0>Babel Tower, <m0>Byatt more than proves that it can, indeed.<ql>
