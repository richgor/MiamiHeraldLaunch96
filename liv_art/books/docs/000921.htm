   <LI> Getting Over Getting Older. Letty Cottin Pogrebin. Little, Brown. 326 pages. $23.95.<BR>
By ANNE STEPHENSON<BR>
<P>

   If you are facing 50, come sit here by Letty Cottin Pogrebin. Pogrebin, one of the founding editors of Ms., wrote about children and family in her books Among Friends  and Growing Up Free. Now she writes about the signs that she is not so young anymore, from her preoccupation with impending mortality to those puffy spots under her eyes to her forgetfulness (she quotes Gloria Steinem, who said, ``At this age, being able to remember something is as good as an orgasm'').<P>

   This is not just a smarmy pep talk but an unflinching discussion of real angst and a real adjustment process.<BR>
<P>

   <LI> God Has Ninety-Nine Names. Judith Miller. Simon & Schuster. 574 pages. $30.<BR>
<P>

   In January 1986, Judith Miller, Middle East correspondent for The New York Times, had just checked into a Libyan hotel -- she was wearing a raincoat, skirt and high heels -- when she was hastily summoned to a bus, driven into the desert and deposited in a barley field. A tractor approached and the driver said, ``Hop in.'' It was Moammar Gadhafi, who steered the tractor erratically around the field, mangling crops, while he and Miller discussed Libya's future.<P>

   This is a wonderfully readable report on the Islamic fervor that has driven Middle East politics since 1979 and on Miller's adventures during 25 years of reporting from the region.<BR>
<P>

 This Damn House! Margo Kaufman. Villard. 211 pages. $21.<BR>
<P>

   The first architect Margo Kaufman interviewed when she and her husband decided to renovate their beach bungalow admitted after an hour of interrogation that he had never remodeled a house. ``But I'm working on a hospital entrance,'' he said. It was an omen, but Margo and Duke plunged in. <P>

   She describes the experience from demolition to doorknobs, from loan applications to light fixtures, from grout to gigantic checks (she wrote them every Friday). Margo and Duke survived with their marriage intact. <P>

   Margo wrote this book because she learned that remodeling in retrospect is funny -- and she needs the cash.<BR>
<P>

   I Was Amelia Earhart. Jane Mendelsohn. Knopf. 146 pages. $18.<BR>
<P>

   In this sensuous first novel, we discover, through shifting third- and first-person narrations, what happened to Amelia Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan (he is addicted to drink, cigarettes and women, and he knows how to read the stars), after their plane went down in 1937.<P>

   Interspersed with descriptions of their life on the island to which they have fallen are Amelia's memories of her youth, her husband (the opportunistic G.P. Putnam) and her beloved plane, now stranded on a reef flat. The story is dreamy, mesmerizing and so brief you can read it in a sitting.<BR>
<P>

   Anne Stephenson reviewed these books for The Arizona Republic.<BR>
