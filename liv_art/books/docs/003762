   Buddy Foster is a Duluth, Minn., building contractor who's written a book that could have America talking when it's released by Dutton/Signet in December:<ep>
   One of the book's first scenes is Foster as a 5-year-old hiding under the breakfast table as his father kicks in the front door.<ep>
   His mother throws dishes at and starts beating his father as Foster peeks out from the tablecloth covering what he calls the ``storm shelter.''<ep>
   A bedroom door opens and a woman clad only in a towel points a gun at his father, who is forced to leave.<ep>
   The woman with the gun was Buddy Foster's mother's <m1> <m0>lover. He grew up knowing her as Aunt Jo (Domingez). Foster said his younger sister, Alicia Christian Foster, received the nickname we all know her by from Aunt Jo.<ep>
   His sister is Academy Award-winning actress Jodie Foster.<ep>
   And now you know why the Duluth builder's book, <m0>A Foster Child,<m0> should generate interest.<ep>
<m1>Leaving Hollywood behind<ep>
<m0>   Foster, 38, married Duluth native Stacy Solon and they decided Duluth is where they wanted to live. Both had Hollywood careers. Foster was a child actor who played the son of actor Ken Berry on the <m0>Mayberry RFD <m0>series, after Andy Griffith left the show in the late 1960s. He also acted in several films. Solon was an associate producer for Paramount Studios when they met.<ep>
   This was only an hour interview and he's a person who was once paid to act, but Lucius Fisher ``Buddy'' Foster IV seems genuinely friendly and unaffected by his Hollywood upbringing.<ep>
   He got into the building business with his father when he was 16 and found he had a knack for it. He calls his Duluth operation Foster and Solon Construction.<ep>
   ``I traveled all over the United States and I fell in love with Duluth,'' he said. ``I wanted to live in a smaller city with canoeing, hiking, skiing and the nature. That's what I'm all about.''<ep>
   Foster is moving his 13-year-old son from a prior marriage to Duluth from Los Angeles this summer and will enroll him in school there next fall. He wants the boy, whose mother is of Hopi Indian and Mexican descent, away from the gang influence of Los Angeles and because ``of the quality of life and schooling here,'' he said.<ep>
<m1>Different schooling<ep>
<m0>   While his famous sister graduated with honors from Yale, Buddy said the only degree he has is from ``the school of hard knocks.''<ep>
   The 5-foot-5, blue-eyed blond's relationship to his sister is evident in his facial features. He said he and Jodie are on good terms and that she plans to visit Duluth. ``She loves hiking and camping and wants to do the Boundary Waters thing with me,'' he said.<ep>
   Foster said he earned almost a half-million dollars as a child actor, but had only $7,000 in a trust fund when he turned 18. His mother spent the rest.<ep>
   ``This is an acting family where during the day we worked as Ozzie and Harriet, but we came home at night to <m0>The Addams Family,<m0>'' he said.<ep>
   Foster doesn't elaborate, other than to say his mother had emotional problems. The rest of the details will be in the book, which he said lawyers have spent a lot of time going over because of his mother.<ep>
   No matter how difficult his childhood might have been, he seems like a happy man.<ep>
   ``Too many people raised in dysfunction hold on to the dysfunction,'' he said. ``Like anything else the experience should be used to better your life.''<ep>
