<m0>   The Internet is often likened to a frontier mining camp (--) a community whose few laws, obscure if not outright hidden, are created by consensus, not legislation. Those who know how to navigate this boomtown's byways can conduct their business in relative peace. But the unfortunate tenderfoot who transgresses can be chased into the sunset by a torrent of e-mail invective and insult.<ep>
   It is for the tenderfoot that the authors, Thomas Mandel (the late eminence grise of the Bay Area's Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (--) the WELL, for short) and agent/writer Gerard Van der Leun, wrote this book, but veteran modem slingers will enjoy it, too.<ep>
   Those who come to <m0>Rules of the Net<m0>  looking for a resource that will explain the arcana of file transfer protocol and remote log-ins will leave as clueless as they came. The book has more in common with Margaret Mead's <m0>Coming of Age in Samoa<m0>  than it does with <m0>The Internet for Dummies.<m0>  It is about how one ought to act, argue and make his mark in online life. The style it uses in setting out these codes of conduct and the reason those codes came into being is relentlessly opinionated, crotchety and unabashed, and it creates as useful and enjoyable an anthropology of Net society as I've yet seen.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>(box) Netchick: A Smart-Girl Guide to the Wired World<m0>. Carla Sinclair. Holt. 244 pages. $19.95.<m1><styl>vs,5<ql>

<m0>   Conventional wisdom being a favored target for intellectual rebels, it's no surprise that Carla Sinclair (--) editor of the pop-culture magazine bOING bOING, (--) uses Netchick to cheerfully ventilate the commonly held belief that the Internet is a boys' club where women enter only at their peril.<ep>
   Sinclair doesn't spend a lot of time complaining about the testosterone flowing over the wires. Instead, she shows the ways gutsy women (Riot Grrrls, as she calls them) are carving out rooms of their own all over the Internet, and in the process creating <m1> <m0>paradigms of tough, competent, smart and sexy femininity.<ep>
   Sinclair presents themes and sets web addresses, interviews, newsgroups and other online resources spinning around them like so many blinking satellites. Among the selections in the ``Sexy'' section, for instance, readers will find a Q&A featuring Lisa Palac, former editor of the review of technology and sexuality, FutureSex; a critique of sex-oriented newsgroups; and ``a puke-inducing Email love story.'' <m0>Netchick<m0>  is mostly good fun, just the sort of slice-of-digital-life one might expect from a Riot Grrrl.<ql>
