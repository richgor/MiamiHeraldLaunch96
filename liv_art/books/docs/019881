<m0>   If you ever thought Gloria Vanderbilt was a silly socialite, think again. She has written a gut-wrenching account of her beloved son's suicide that is so real, so heartfelt, it will make you double over in pain. It will also make you feel less alone, less crazy and less hopeless if you are struggling to live with the loss of someone you love.<ep>
   Vanderbilt, whose life has been chronicled in books and TV movies, is best known to baby boomers for hawking blue jeans. But she is best known to their parents for being the 9-year-old at the center of a bitter 1934 custody case, which left the heiress with an aunt who didn't give a hoot about her.<ep>

<m0>   The woman with the big red smile, flour-white face and black flip hairdo parlayed her childhood inheritance of $4 million into a $150 million design business. But this is not what her book, <m0>A Mother's Story, <m0>is about. <ep>

<m1>The glass bubble<ep>
<m0>   It's about her struggle to give and receive love, to ``break out of the glass bubble'' that she felt surrounded her. It's about the summer of 1971, when on vacation with her fourth husband, Wyatt Cooper (who died seven years later), and her two young sons, she felt she had succeeded, at last. <ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   But most of all, it's about what broke the glass bubble and shattered her: In 1988, Carter Cooper, Vanderbilt's 23-year-old son, flung himself off the balcony of her 14th floor Manhattan apartment as she watched. His last words as he turned toward her: ``F - - - you.''<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   How to recover? How to recover? How to recover? <m1> <m0>That's what <m0>A Mother's Story <m0>is about. And the answer comes in the haunting details of the death and Vanderbilt's struggle to accept it and continue living. She writes of the moment of Carter's death: `` . . . I moved towards him, my hand reaching for his, but as I did he moved, deftly as an athlete over the wall, holding on to the edge as if it were a practice bar in a gym. . . . Carter, come back, I shouted, and for a moment I thought he was going to. But he didn't (--) he let go.'' <ep>
   She writes of her denial in the minutes and hours after: ``I kept going through my address book, calling people, friends I loved, at random (--) certain that the next one was going to be the one telling me <m0>it had not happened.<m0>'' <ep>
<m1>The realization<ep>
<m0>   She writes of when the police arrived, and she realized it was true: ``I sat down on a bench in the hall and opened my mouth and a sound came. . . . <m1> <m0>It came from an animal (--) on and on it went <m1> <m0>. . . <m1> <m0>and as it came (--) on and on (--) I split in two. <m1> <m0>. . . '' Vanderbilt leaves nothing out: ``Carter, I'll never be the same,'' she writes in a letter to her dead son. ``I am below sea level, centered there, balanced in pain that will never leave me. . . . <m1> <m0>Carter, come to me. Don't leave me. . . .''<ep>
    She includes her diary entries that tell of her struggle to want to go on living: ``I feel so alone. <m1> <m0>. . . <m1> <m0>I have to breathe in and out to stay alive. . . .'' She tells of her emergence from darkness into the light, and in the telling she holds out her hand to anyone struggling to keep going after an agonizing loss: ``Don't give up. Don't ever give up,'' Vanderbilt says. ``Although nothing will ever be the same <m1> <m0>. . . <m1> <m0>you will come through.'' <m1> <m0>You will not be able to keep reading, so raw and painful is this book; you will not be able to put it down. And, when you finish it, you will emerge as does Gloria Vanderbilt, from the darkness into the shining world, thankful that she had the heart and courage to go through such a painful journey and take you with her. <ql>
