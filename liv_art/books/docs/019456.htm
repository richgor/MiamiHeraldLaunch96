   <LI> Grey Area: And Other Stories. Will Self. Atlantic Monthly. 287 pages. $22.<BR>
By ALAN RYAN<BR>
<P>

   If Magritte had been a writer instead of a painter, his work might have looked something like these nine stories. Will Self is daring, original and possessed of both an antic wit and a thoroughly jaundiced view of modern society. His stories -- each sharply and realistically focused, filled with engaging detail -- show the passionate patience he lavishes on each unique, twisted, off-center little world. <P>

   Take A Short History of the English Novel. Everyone knows the old joke about waiters in New York City (or Los Angeles) who are really all actors who are only working as waiters until they get a break. Grey takes the familiar premise and reshapes it. Here, Gerard, a book editor, goes to lunch with a friend and meets at every turn the seething wrath of countless would-be novelists whose work has been uniformly rejected by the powers that be, that is, people like himself.<BR>
 <BR>
   Gerard and the narrator seek peace and quiet in several restaurants and coffee bars in Central London, but in one, a waiter offers a sample from his novel told from the point of view of a sexually precocious dog: ``Then one night, as I turned and tossed in my basket. . . . '' A waitress in another place outlines the plot of her novel: ``My heroine surveys the whole panorama of such a herstory. From the shifting meaning of hygiene as an ideology. . . .'' And a waiter in a fish restaurant physically attacks (``Flotch! . . . Glotch!'') with leftover seafood.<BR>
<P>

   In another story, a character who works for a medical research facility describes how he once ``was able to persuade an overwhelmingly hostile media that there were sound medical reasons for surgically bifurcating the foot of African tribesmen in order to provide them with two giant prehensile toes.''<P>

   Another story posits an apiacentric world, in which every human consciousness is actually the dream of an individual honeybee. Elsewhere, a character testing a new psychotropic drug experiences ``a surge of motiveless and directionless interest in everything,'' which, not surprisingly, he finds ``quite disturbing.'' Yet another character, like an escapee from the world of Monty Python, is a pretty good chess player but has the ``intensely irritating'' habit of ``neighing whenever he moves his knights.'' The first story in the book is a tale told by a genial madman and the last takes a not entirely unexpected, razor-like slash at the reader's heart.<P>

   Paranoia simmers everywhere here, just at or below the surfaces of Self's otherwise cozy and comfortable world, filled with familiar odd bits of life in and around London -- Marks and Sparks, Long Acre, Chalk Farm, Camden Town, the tube. But it's in this very world that a character voices the lingering worry ``that perhaps everything I have ever heard anyone say has been subjected to undue emphasis.''<P>

   Readers of speculative fiction -- a polite name for science fiction with a high degree of wit and intellectual content -- will be right at home here, constantly reminded of the short stories of Philip K. Dick, Robert Sheckley and perhaps Theodore Sturgeon on the rare occasions when he was in a bad mood.<P>
