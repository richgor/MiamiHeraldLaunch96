<m0>  The school year is winding to a close, but that doesn't mean it's too late to be learning. In fact, May is a fine time for kids to be brushing up on skills or exploring a subject in depth. Like math. Math is the subject that all children either seem to love or hate, excel at or struggle with.<ep>
  Now, math isn't usually a subject that gets a creative treatment in children's books. It's a textbook subject, workbook topic, a hands-on exploration (--) making change, counting blocks, adding scores. But here is a selection of books that make math, of one sort or another, the subject of the story.<ep>

<m0>  <m0>(box) Math Curse<m0>. Jon Scieszka. Illustrated by Lane Smith. Viking. $16.99. Ages 8 and up.<ep>
<m1><styl>vs,5<ql>
<styl>ragx <styl>txt<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   The clever team of Scieszka and Smith (of <m0>The True Story of the Three Little Pigs<m0> and the <m0>Stinky Cheese <m0>book fame) here turn their brains, wit and art to the subject of math, and it's guaranteed that no one venturing into this book will ever see math (--) or life (--) in the same way.<ep>
  It begins: ``On Monday, in math class, Mrs. Fibonacci says, `You know, you can think of almost everything as a math problem.' ''<ep>
   And thus the fun starts in this story of a girl cursed by math.<ep>
   From morning till bedtime, everything becomes a math problem (--) minutes of the day, kids on the bus, the length of the Mississippi River. There are tricky questions to be answered, and lots of zany jokes.<ep>
   <m0>Math Curse<m0> offers enjoyment on many levels, with hidden theorems and difficult math stratagems buried in the text and art (including Fermat's Last Theorem, which took 350 years to solve and is tucked into the girl's math ``nightmare'' illustration).<ep>
  And by the way, Smith, the illustrator, was the art director for the critically acclaimed film, <m0>James and the Giant Peach.<m0><ep>

<m0> <m0>(box) Anno's Magic Seeds<m0>.<m0> <m0>Mitsumasa Anno. Philomel. $15.95. Ages 3-7.<ep>
<m1><styl>vs,5<ql>
<styl>ragx <styl>txt<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   Mitsumasa Anno has written a wonderful story in the form of one gigantic math problem, <m1> <m0>which <m1> <m0>also, in a way, explains the beginnings of commerce (--) and thus economics. <ep>
   It starts with Jack and two seeds he's been given by the wizard, one to eat and one to plant. Diligently, Jack does that year after year, till he realizes he's in a rut.<ep>
   Then he plants two seeds, and the multiplication begins. Soon he has enough for friends, then enough to sell, and by the ninth year, there are plenty of seeds to plant and sell (and some math to do as well.) <ep>
   There's a double message here, too: The fable is about life as well as math.<ep>
   Anno is committed to teaching math through such stories, and this is just the newest of a number of disarming math-puzzle books he's written over the years. He is a lovely artist, a winner of the Hans Christian Andersen Award among other honors, and the delicate illustrations here add to the engaging quality of the story.<ep>

<m0>  <m0>(box) The Greedy Triangle<m0>. Marilyn Burns. Illustrated by Gordon Silveria. Scholastic. $14.95. Ages 6-9.<ep>
<m1><styl>vs,5<ql>
<styl>ragx <styl>txt<ql>
<ep>
<m0>  A math story told in the fashion of a fairy tale, <m0>The Greedy Triangle<m0> is about both geometry and life. It's the tale of a triangle bored and dissatisfied with the same old things, ``holding up roofs, supporting bridges, playing in a symphony orchestra,'' and goes off to see the ``shapeshifter.''<ep>
   Soon, he's a quadrilateral, then a pentagon, then a hexagon and so forth until he has so many sides he can't keep his balance any more.<ep>
  <m0>The Greedy Triangle<m0> is cleverly told, and illustrated with candy-colored pastels. And for those parents or teachers interested in making the most of it, there's a guide at the back with suggested learning activities.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>(box) The Shape of Things.<m0> Dayle Ann Dodds. Illustrated by Julie Lacome. Candlewick Press. $13.95. Ages 2 and up.<ep>
<m1><styl>vs,5<ql>
<styl>ragx <styl>txt<ql>
<ep>
<m0>  With a lively rhyming text and bright, appealing illustrations, <m0>The Shape of Things<m0> ought to please many a young reader.<ep>
   It's not specifically a math book, but few books for very young children introduce the concepts of geometry so well. Slightly older children will find the last pages especially absorbing as they're asked to count the shapes they can find in the final illustration (the answer is in the hundreds).<ep>

<m0>  <m0>(box) Insides, Outsides, Loops, and Lines<m0>. Herbert Kohl. Illustrated by Winky Adam. Scientific American Books for Young Readers. $12.95. Ages 9 and up.<ep>
<m1><styl>vs,5<ql>
<styl>ragx <styl>txt<ql>
<ep>
<m0>  The subtitle of this book is ``Not Just Another Math Book,'' and it certainly lives up to its billing. It's a workbook, not a storybook, but it delves into some fascinating concepts (--) patterns created by the Tchokwe people of southern Africa for baskets, mats, rugs and paintings; theorems behind the design of garden mazes; or the making of maps. It does this while teaching math and challenging young minds.<ep>

<m0>  ``Two robots had a race to space,'' begins this book for young learners. It's a story plus a game, and it offers an easy way to learn geometry. The story is deceptively amusing as the two robots assemble their rockets. The book includes colorful punch-out shapes, so that readers can work alongside the robots and make their own rocket. <m1><ep>
