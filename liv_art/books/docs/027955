<m0>n radio call-ins and at book-store signings, Gloria Vanderbilt's fifth book is drawing a different kind of audience.<ep>
   They're not so much interested in the celebrity Vanderbilt (--) born to a railroad baron, wooed by Frank Sinatra, made wealthier by her designer-jeans line (--) as they are the parent Vanderbilt, who lost a son to suicide.<ep>
   The 71-year-old heiress is connecting to them with an intimacy so disarming that it seems astonishing. When the subject is a son's or daughter's death, ``you're stripped to the bone,'' she says. ``It's complete honesty.''<ep>
   Vanderbilt, who will be at Books & Books in Coral Gables tonight, is the author of two autobiographies and two novels. Her newest book, <m0>A Mother's Story<m0>  (Knopf, $20), is the raw account of the 1988 suicide of her 23-year-old son Carter, who threw himself from the balcony of her 14th-floor New York apartment as she begged him not to.<ep>
   Many of those who have come to see Vanderbilt on her national book tour are people who share her pain. ``The readings are filled with people who have lost children,'' she says.<ep>
   But she offers no tips, no self-help guide, no 12-step program to recovery.<ep>
   All she offers, Vanderbilt says, is her own experience. Her own agony. Her own questioning. Her own survival. Sharing, she says, may be more important than <m2><ql>

   ``I have found that suicide is something we know very little about,'' she says. ``Because it is so overwhelming, people are afraid to talk about it. But in surviving such a loss, talking is a way of healing.<ep>
   ``You have to understand that when it first happens, you go somewhere below sea level. It's like trying to breathe water instead of air. You have to take each breath from moment to moment to stay alive.''<ep>
   In the eight years since Carter's death, Vanderbilt says she has learned more about herself and her inner strengths than the cause for her son's suicide. He came to her apartment on July 22, 1988, appearing mildly despondent. He took a short nap, then he took his life. Why remains a mystery. ``It was as if he clicked into something,'' his mother says.<ep>
   For a surviving parent, the temptation is to click into that same self-destructiveness, she says. The only way to prevent that is to ``reach outside yourself, communicate with others.''<ep>
   ``In the beginning, my support group was family and friends,'' says Vanderbilt, who is widowed with three surviving sons. ``But after five weeks, I joined a group of parents and friends of suicide victims. If I had known more about these groups, I'd have joined right away.''<ep>
   Judy Tomeny, who with her husband Gary runs the Dade County chapter of Compassionate Friends, a support group for grieving parents and siblings, says Vanderbilt learned that lesson sooner than she and her husband did. The Tomenys lost their 2-year-old son to cancer 16 years before joining Compassionate Friends in 1988.<ep>
   ``We realized we had a lot buried pain,'' Judy Tomeny says. ``You deal with it all your life.''<ep>
   Vanderbilt says she gained an understanding that, despite the emotional scars, she could go on. Time, she discovered, does indeed heal.<ep>
   After deciding she wanted to convey such a message, Vanderbilt, who says she is a slow writer, taking about two years to write each of her earlier books, wrote <m0>A Mother's Story <m0>in three weeks.<ep>
   ``I've met parents who had lost someone a year ago, or five years ago, and I found hope in seeing that if you just hang on, you can get through it,'' says Vanderbilt.<ep>
   ``As each day passes, and you are still alive, you know you are working through it. That's when hope comes.''<ql>
