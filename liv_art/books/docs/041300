<m0>   <m0>Ernest J. Gaines, <m0>whose 1993 novel, <m0>A Lesson Before Dying, <m0>won the National Book Critics Circle Award and was a finalist for the fiction Pulitzer Prize, has been named a Chevalier of France's Order of Arts and Letters. <ep>
   The award, established in 1957, was presented to Gaines by <m0>Minister of Culture Philippe Douste-Blazy <m0>during the Salon du Livre, France's foremost publishing event, which this year honored the U.S. literary tradition. Past winners include <m0>Susan Sontag, William Styron, Saul Bellow, Ralph Ellison, Stephen King, Francine du Plessix Gray, Mary McCarthy <m0>and Surfside's late Nobel laureate, <m0>Isaac Bashevis Singer.<m0><ep>
   Gaines is married to the former <m0>Dianne Saulney Smith, <m0>a former assistant Dade County attorney and the first African-American on the Florida Bar's board of governors. Gaines was born in Oscar, La., and is writer in residence at the University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette. He has spent this spring teaching creative writing in France.<ql>

   <m0>Mile <m0>went on sale March 25 with 2.6 million copies in print; now, after seven printings, there are 3.1 million copies. So far, <m0>The Two Dead Girls <m0>and <m0>The Mouse on the Mile <m0>are only available segments<m0>. Coffey's Hands <m0>is due May 24, to be followed by <m0>The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix <m0>on June 24; <m0>Night Journey <m0>on July 29 and <m0>Coffey on the Mile <m0>on Aug. 26. Best news: The segments retail for $2.99 each.<ql>
