Alcott manuscript<BR>

   The manuscript of Louisa May Alcott's very first novel, all but unknown to scholars and written when the author was 18, has been found in the Houghton Library at Harvard University, where it was apparently miscatalogued a generation ago.<P>

   Discovered by two professors researching Alcott's letters and journals, the novel, titled The Inheritance,  was written in 1849 and tells the tumultuous tale of Edith, a poor orphaned Italian girl adopted by a wealthy English family.<P>

   The manuscript was apparently never offered for publication and was never mentioned in Alcott's journals, said Lane Zachary of the Zachary Shuster Agency in Boston, a literary partnership, which is offering the work simultaneously to publishers and film companies for bidding. Zachary categorized The Inheritance  as a young-adult novel.<P>

   ``There is no record of it,'' said Zachary, who in 1994 negotiated the seven-figure sale of A Long Fatal Love Chase,  an Alcott novel rejected in the 19th Century as too sensational to be published.<P>

   In some ways -- the use of the name Amy and the close sisterly relationship between Edith and Amy, the leading characters -- The Inheritance  prefigures Little Women,  Alcott's most famous novel, which was published in 1869 and has been considered her second novel. Before the discovery of The Inheritance,  scholars listed Moods  (1864) as Alcott's first novel.<P>

   ``Startled'' was the word used by Joel Myerson, Carolina Research Professor of American Literature at the University of South Carolina, to describe his reaction when he and Daniel Shealy, associate professor of English at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, came across the 150-page manuscript of The Inheritance. <P>

   Shealy said: ``We looked at each other, and we said, have you heard of this? And each of us looked at the other and said no, and I think we smiled and said this is important.''<P>

   Assessing the significance of Alcott's Inheritance,  Myerson said: ``First of all, it shows she was a remarkably accomplished writer at a young age. Here we have her working at something that was very close to the adult fiction of her time. In other words, she is patterning herself on the popular literature of the time.<P>

   ``And it contains within it the elements of not only her Gothic stories such as A Long Fatal Love Chase  but also the elements of her more adult fiction, such as Little Women.''<P>

   Shealy noted that the only previous reference to The Inheritance  was a single sentence in Madeleine B. Stern's authoritative biography Louisa May Alcott,  a 1950 work. Stern said Tuesday that her book had just been reprinted in paperback by Random House.<P>

   Alcott died childless in 1888, and rights to the manuscript are the property of John Pratt of Cambridge, Mass., and his two brothers. ``Branson Alcott, her father, was my great-great-grandfather,'' Pratt said Tuesday, adding that the two professors would also share in the proceeds from The Inheritance. <P>

   ``I feel very kindly toward the professors,'' Pratt said.<P>

   No one seemed to know exactly how the manuscript became separated from the main body of Alcott's work. Stern, who said she must have read The Inheritance  while researching her 1950 biography, said some of the Alcott papers were then at Orchard House, the Alcott museum in Concord, N.H., and others were already in the library at Harvard.<P>

    Zachary said she understood that sometime in the 1960s, the Alcott heirs deposited additional material in the Houghton Library.<P>

   In any event, the two professors came across the work in the late 1980s or in 1990 but said their commitment to other projects prevented them from returning to The Inheritance  until this year.<P>

   Myerson said he and Shealy had yet to encounter any clues to the circumstances under which Alcott wrote the novel.<P>

   ``I think it is fair to say we have read every letter written by Louisa May Alcott and every entry in every journal, and there is no reference to this or anything like this there.''<P>

   But he said he and Shealy, who are co-editors of other Alcott material, will pursue the matter when they return to Harvard this summer. Myerson described Branson Alcott as a ``pack rat'' and said his papers might shed some light. ``But there is nothing by Louisa to help us.''<P>

   Pratt said that like the professors, he, too was surprised by the discovery of the manuscript of the The Inheritance,  which followed relatively hard on the heels of the furor over the rediscovery and lucrative resurrection of A Long Fatal Love Chase. <P>

   ``I always wondered how many others might be,'' he said with some amusement, ``but I've been assured that there are not likely to be any.''
