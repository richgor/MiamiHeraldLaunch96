<m0>illiam Bartram (1739-1823) was an artist, writer, botanist, gardener, naturalist, wilderness explorer, self-styled ``philosophical pilgrim'' and the first American to dedicate his life to the study of the environment. <ep>
   In 1765, Bartram's father, John, was appointed botanist for the North American colonies by King George III, and the two men launched an expedition to Florida. John went home in the spring of 1766, but his son, hopeful of starting a rice and indigo plantation on the banks of the St. Johns River, remained until he fell ill with fever and the venture had failed. The younger Bartram returned to Florida in the 1770s during a 2,400-mile trek through the South, on which he collected botanical specimens, made wildlife drawings and observed the world around him with a vision shaped both by the rigors of science and his Quaker spirituality. Now The Library of America gives us<m0> William Bartram: Travels and Other Writings, <m0>an account of those wanderings. The book, which contains 48 pages of plates, 16 of them in color, is priced at $37.50, a trifle to pay for such a treasure. Here Bartram writes about a visit to an island in Lake George at the edge of what is now Ocala National Forest:<m0><ql>

<ep>
<m0> This island appears, from obvious vestiges, to have been once the chosen residence of an Indian prince, there being to this day evident remains of a large town of the Aborigines. It was situated on an eminence, near the banks of the lake, and commanded a comprehensive and charming prospect of the waters, islands, east and west shores of the lake, the capes, the bay, and Mount Royal; and to the south the view is in a manner infinite, where the skies and waters seem to unite. On the site of this ancient town, stands a very pompous Indian mount, or conical pyramid of earth, from which runs in a strait line a grand avenue or Indian highway, through a magnificent grove of magnolias, live oaks, palms, and orange trees, terminating at the verge of a large green level savanna. This island appears to have been well inhabited, as is very evident, from the quantities of fragments of Indian earthenware, bones of animals and other remains, particularly in the shelly heights and ridges all over the island. There are no habitations at present on the island, but a great number of deer, turkeys, bears, wolves, wild cats, squirrels, racoons, and opossums. The bears are invited here to partake of the fruit of the orange tree, which they are immoderately fond of; and both they and turkeys are made extremely fat and delicious, from their feeding on the sweet acorns of the live oak.<ep>
 There grow on this island many curious shrubs, particularly a beautiful species of lantana. It grows in coppices in old fields, about five or six feet high, the branches adorned with rough serrated leaves, which sit opposite, and the twigs terminated with umbelliferous tufts of orange coloured blossoms, which are succeeded by a cluster of small blue berries; the flowers are of various colours, on the same plant, and even in the same cluster, as crimson, scarlet, orange and golden yellow: the whole plant is of a most agreeable scent. The orange-flowered shrub Hibiscus is also conspicuously beautiful.<ql>
