<BR>

Rain reunion...<BR>
<BR>

drag diva doings<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
TODAY<BR>
<P>

  <LI> The Fifth Annual United Negro College Fund Benefit, hosted by the Orange Bowl Committee, promises cocktails, dinner and a contemporary jazz concert by Najee (Share My World).  Awards presentations for Excellence in Community Service and Education will be presented to Bishop Victor T. Curry and Jerry Rushin, general manager of 99 JAMZ (WEDR-99.1 FM). It starts at 6:30 p.m. at the Hotel Inter-Continental, 100 Chopin Plaza, Miami. Tickets are $50 each or $500 for a table of 10. Call Ticketmaster or 373-4622. See Page 16G for more details.<P>

SATURDAY<P>

  <LI> Have a hair-raising time at The Second Annual Blowout, a mega-hair and fashion show with enough sulky-looking models and stylists to curl the droopiest locks. (That's a lot.) You say you want celebrities? Peruse this emcee lineup: Melrose Place's  mad doctor, Marcia Cross; Beverly Hills, 90210's  pouty brainiac, Kathleen Robertson; Planet Soul's Nadine Renee; Naughty by Nature's Treach; Lina Santiago; and VH1's Male Model of the Year, Tyson Beckford. The Blowout benefits the United Foundation for AIDS and Health Crisis Network. It happens from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturday at Amnesia, 136 Collins Ave., Miami Beach. Tickets are $20 or $40 V.I.P. at Ticketmaster. Ages 18 and older only. Call 626-3864.    <LI> Guys, break out your ruffled poet shirts and black eyeliner because The Purple Rain Reunion Tour is cruising into town on a wave of '80s nostalgia. Never mind the chart-busting 1984 album, what about the incredibly silly, self-indulgent movie? Remember all those endless motorcycle-riding scenes? Remember how Prince wore more makeup than his glassy-eyed vixen-of-the-moment, Apollonia? For that matter, remember Apollonia? (We didn't think so.) Sorry folks but T.A.F.K.A.P (The Artist Formerly Known as Prince) won't be attending. Instead, Morris Day & the Time -- you must remember the slick, funk rockers who performed The Bird and Jungle Love  -- will be onstage. Show time is 10:30 p.m. Saturday at the Cameo Theater, 1445 Washington Ave., Miami Beach. Doors open at 9:30. Tickets are $15. Call 532-0922 or Ticketmaster.<P>

   <LI> Get victimized at the VICTIM III Showcase, an afternoon jam with live music by Skintite, El Duende, The Way and Inch High Allah. It starts at 3 p.m. Saturday at Rose's, 754 Washington Ave., Miami Beach. Then stick around to hear Mary Karlzen perform at 11 p.m. Cover is $5, ages 21 and over; $7 under 21. Call 532-0228.    <LI> The fabulousness continues on South Beach with drag diva RuPaul. You've seen The Birdcage , Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and To Wong Foo.  But, honey, Ru was there long before Gene Hackman discovered the thrill of silk. The goddess brings her Supermodel  shtick to Warsaw Saturday night. Doors open at 9:30 p.m. but we recommend arriving later because divas can be fickle. Tickets are $15 for the 18 and over show and are available at the Warsaw box office at 1450 Collins Ave., Miami Beach. Call 531-4555.<P>

THE REST OF THE WEEK<P>

    <LI> Gloria Estefan, Jose Feliciano and Juan Gabriel will reap awards at Billboard's Seventh Annual Latin Music Conference, a high-profile shindig to honor the top selling Hispanic artists of the year. Hosted by Michael De Lorenzo (from TV's New York Undercover), the show will also feature live music by Albita, Heroes del Silencio, Pete Astudillo and Jos&eacute; Feliciano. Show time is 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts, 174 E. Flagler St., Miami. Balcony seats are available for $20. Call 372-0925. For more information, see Page 14G.  <LI> Catch more than rays at SunFest '96, a five-day celebration of art and music featuring 40 concerts, including some of the hippest alternative voices on radio. You'll see Joan Osborne (One of Us) , Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories (Ethan Hawkes' pushy neighbor who broke out on the Reality Bites  soundtrack with Stay)  and local rocker Mary Karlzen (who debuted with Yelling at Mary).  There's also an art show, children's activities at the NationsBank Youth Park, a food court and a fireworks show on May 3. All events are along Flagler Drive, (from Banyan Boulevard to Lakeview Avenue), in downtown West Palm Beach. Hours are 5 to 10 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, noon to 10 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Admission is $8 in advance; $12 at the gate. Call (407) 659-5992. For more information, see page 16G.<P>
