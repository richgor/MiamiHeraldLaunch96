SATURDAY<P>

  <LI> South Florida isn't exactly known for its mountains, unless you count Mt. Trashmore, which we'd rather not. But that doesn't mean we don't know a thing or two about mountain biking. Witness the two-day Bud Light Mountain Bike Festival, a 7-to-10 mile yearly cycling competition being held this year along the bike trails of Oleta State Recreational Area in North Miami. There's also a Triathlon, Slalom Challenge, Kids Competitions, a Fun and Fitness Ride and a Restaurant and Bar Charity Ride to benefit The Children's Home Society. The Mountain Bike Expo starts at 9 a.m. Sunday at Oleta State Recreational Area, 3400 NE 163rd St., North Miami. Registration fees are $20 on race day, $15 in advance. There is a $3.25 park admission fee. Registration and other events start at 3 p.m. Saturday and continue that day with a barbecue and live music at 7 p.m. The festival winds down at 3 p.m. Sunday with a party and free buffet at Shooters, 3501 NE 163rd St., North Miami. Prizes include $2,000 cash, a Diamondback mountain bike, Air South tickets to next year's festival in Atlanta and lots of sports gear. To compete, you must bring a bike and a helmet. For a complete schedule and prices, call (407) 241-3801.   <LI> An antique car show, rock and roll music by Majic 102.7 radio (WMXJ 102.7 FM), contests, hourly raffles, an Elvis impersonator and animals from five shelters will be available for adoption at the Nifty Fifty Pet Adoptathon.
