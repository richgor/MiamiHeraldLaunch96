CLASSICAL MUSIC<BR>
<P>

   <LI>  New World closing ceremony: Richard Stoltzman, the clarinetist who can taper a tone into what often seems infinity, and who opened the '95-96 season with the New World Symphony, is coming back to help close the season Monday with his chamber group Tashi. More than ever, Tashi, a five-member ensemble once closely identified with the pianist Peter Serkin, has become Stoltzman's personal showcase. Look at the music: an excerpt from Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time, which stars the clarinet, plus Weber and Brahms clarinet quintets. The concert, courtesy of Miami's Friends of Chamber Music, starts at 8:15 p.m. in the University of Miami's Gusman Concert Hall. Tickets cost $17; half-price for students. Call (305) 372-2975.<P>

<LI> Brazil and France bring young artists: Miami's Brazilian consul, Luiz Fernando Benedini, who leads a double life as a virtuoso pianist and enjoys presenting gifted colleagues when he can, is collaborating with the University of Miami to bring a compatriot to town. And simultaneously, the Miami chapter of Alliance Francaise, with the French Cultural Services and Coral Gables Congregational Church, are joining forces to bring a Parisian pianist here.<P>

   The Brazilian, Ruth Serrao, teaches at Rio's main music conservatory and will bow Wednesday in the UM's intimate Clarke Recital Hall, playing 24 piano preludes -- not the famous Chopin 24, but preludes by assorted Pan-American composers, including Villa-Lobos, Santoro, Guarneri and Guerra Peixe. Then Friday, Francois Chaplin, a winner of the 1989 Robert Casadesus Competition in Cleveland, will perform music by Debussy and Chopin at Coral Gables Congregational.<P>

   Tickets to the Brazilian concert, which begins at 8 p.m., cost $10, $5 for senior citizens; free to students with I.D.; and can be purchased at the door. Call (305) 284-2438. Tickets to the French recital cost $18; $15 to Alliance and Congregational Church members; and $7 for students. . Call (305) 859-8760. Tickets will be also available at the door. <P>

<LI> Two pianos: Even in its off-season, the Dranoff Competition for duopianists, held once every two years in Miami, seems in perpetual motion. Its latest event: a fund-raiser on Sunday spotlighting a past winning team, the Klavier Duo Stenzel of Germany. Direct from a South American tour, the brothers Hans Peter and Volker Stenzel, who placed second in 1989, will play Brahms, Schubert and Lutoslawski at Miami Beach's Eden Roc hotel at 5 p.m.<P>

  Sunday's concert will be preceded by a champagne reception, and followed by Viennese desserts. Admission, including the wine and food, is $75 and benefits the Murray Dranoff Foundation, which mounts the competition and other related two-piano projects. Call (305) 758-8700 or fax (305) 757-0686.<BR>
VISUAL ARTS<BR>
<P>

   <LI> Family and folk: If you haven't seen Grandma Moses' folk art paintings of bucolic bliss -- on exhibit at the Fort Lauderdale Museum of Art through May 19 -- the museum invites you take in the show as well as a Folk Arts Festival, from 1-4 p.m. today. It's a family affair featuring time-honored traditions of quilting, basketry and storytelling, with musical performances by local folk musicians and demonstrations by folk artists. The event, including museum admission, is free. The Museum of Art is located at One East Las Olas Blvd., Fort Lauderdale. For more information call (954) 525-5500.<BR>
FILM<BR>
<P>

   <LI> Pulling rank: Tom Hanks is the king of the actors, winning the undisputed world title this month from both Premiere and Entertainment Weekly. According to Premiere's annual list of the most powerful people in Hollywood, Hanks is the highest-ranked actor (in 10th place), just ahead of Tom Cruise (11), Jim Carrey (14) and Mel Gibson (18). In Entertainment Weekly's annual Are They Worth It? investigation, Hanks ranks first in box-office draw, and is the only star that the magazine deems worth $20 million a film. Morgan Freeman is deemed ``Hollywood's most undervalued star,'' earning only $5 million to $6 million per picture. EW says he deserves $11.4 million.<BR>
ETC.<BR>
<P>

   <LI> Celebrity auction: At Planet Hollywood on Sunday, you might mix fact (real people) and fiction (cardboard cutouts of same).<P>

   Scheduled to be there to help kick off June 17's Inner-City Games are celebs Andy Garcia, Tom Arnold, Danny Glover and Arsenio Hall, plus Olympic superstars Edwin Moses and Katerina Witt. They'll play auctioneer and help take bids on items such as Hollywood memorabilia, walk-on movie parts and a BMW donated by auto dealer Norman Braman.<P>

   Chaired by North Dade's Bob Beamon, who won an Olympic gold in 1968 for the long jump, the games last year involved more than 5,000 students from ages 9 to 14. This year's goal is to involve 12,000.<P>

   Tickets to the Sunday event, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., are $100 (which sponsors one child in the competition) and $300 (which lets you rub shoulders with the stars). Call Milana Beamon at (305) 673-0021 for details.<P>
