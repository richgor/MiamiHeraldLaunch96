<m0>SATURDAY<ep>
<m0>  (box) Have a hair-raising time at <m0>The Second Annual Blowout, <m0>a mega-hair and fashion show with enough sulky-looking models and stylists to curl the droopiest locks. (That's a lot.) You say you want celebrities? Peruse this emcee lineup: <m0>Melrose Place<m0>'s  mad doctor, <m0>Marcia Cross<m0>;<m0> Beverly Hills, 90210's  <m0>pouty brainiac, <m0>Kathleen Robertson; <m0>Planet Soul's <m0>Nadine Renee; <m0>Naughty by Nature's <m0>Treach<m0>; <m0>Lina Santiago; <m0>and VH1's Male Model of the Year, <m1> <m0>Tyson Beckford. <m0>The Blowout benefits the United Foundation for AIDS and Health Crisis Network. It happens from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturday at Amnesia, 136 Collins Ave., Miami Beach. Tickets are $20 or $40 V.I.P. at Ticketmaster. Ages 18 and older only. Call 626-3864. <m1> <ep>
<m0>   (box) Guys, break out your ruffled poet shirts and black eyeliner because <m0>The Purple Rain Reunion Tour <m0>is cruising into town on a wave of '80s nostalgia.<m0> <m0>Never mind the chart-busting 1984 album, what about the incredibly silly, self-indulgent movie? Remember all those endless motorcycle-riding scenes? Remember how Prince wore more makeup than his glassy-eyed vixen-of-the-moment, Apollonia? For that matter, remember Apollonia? (We didn't think so.) Sorry folks but T.A.F.K.A.P (The Artist Formerly Known as Prince) won't be attending. Instead, <m0>Morris Day & the Time<m0> (--) you must remember the slick, funk rockers who performed <m0>The Bird<m0> and <m0>Jungle Love  <m0>(--) will be onstage. Show time is 10:30 p.m. Saturday at the Cameo Theater, 1445 Washington Ave., Miami Beach. Doors open at 9:30. Tickets are $15. Call 532-0922 or Ticketmaster.<m1><ep>
<m0>  <m0> (box) <m0>Get victimized at the <m0>VICTIM III Showcase, <m0>an afternoon jam with live music by <m0>Skintite, El Duende, The Way <m0>and <m0>Inch High Allah. <m0>It starts at 3 p.m. Saturday at Rose's, 754 Washington Ave., Miami Beach.

<m0>   (box) The fabulousness continues on South Beach with drag diva <m0>RuPaul.<m0> You've seen <m0>The Birdcage <m0>, <m0>Priscilla, Queen of the Desert <m0>and <m0>To Wong Foo.  <m0>But, honey, Ru was there long before Gene Hackman discovered the thrill of silk. The goddess brings her <m0>Supermodel  <m0>shtick to Warsaw Saturday night. Doors open at 9:30 p.m. but we recommend arriving later because divas can be fickle. Tickets are $15 for the 18 and over show and are available at the Warsaw box office at 1450 Collins Ave., Miami Beach. Call 531-4555.<m1><ep>
<m0>THE REST OF THE WEEK<ep>

You'll see <m0>Joan Osborne <m0>(<m0>One of Us)<m0> , <m0>Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories <m0>(Ethan Hawkes' pushy neighbor who broke out on the <m0>Reality Bites  <m0>soundtrack with <m0>Stay<m0>)  and local rocker <m0>Mary Karlzen <m0>(who debuted with <m0>Yelling at Mary).  <m0>There's also an art show, children's activities at the NationsBank Youth Park, a food court and a fireworks show on May 3.
