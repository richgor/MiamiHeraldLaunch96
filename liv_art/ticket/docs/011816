<m0>(box) Opera redux:<m0> So Verdi's <m0>A Masked Ball<m0> has come and gone and you thought the opera season was over, right? Wrong. Beginning May 10, Handel's <m0>Julius Caesar<m0>, the same florid Baroque period piece that vaulted Beverly Sills to overnight fame as a coloratura soprano with the New York City Opera, will receive four performances (--) two in Miami Beach, two in Fort Lauderdale (--) with singers of the Florida Grand Opera's Young Artist program.<ep>
   This is the first time in its 12-year history that the Young Artist program will offer productions in both Dade and Broward. Jennifer Swanson and Darci Bultema will alternate as Cleopatra (--) the role that brought Sills renown. Claudia Zahn, who will soon make her New York debut directing Donizetti's <m0>Lucrezia Borgia<m0>  for Opera Manhattan, will stage the FGO production.<ep>
  Performances are 8 p.m. Friday and 2 p.m. May 12 at Miami Beach's Colony Theatre, and 8 p.m. May 14 and 16 at the intimate Amaturo Theatre in the Broward Center for the Performing Arts. Tickets cost $15 for all performances. Call (305) 854-7890 in Dade, (800) 741-1010 elsewhere in South Florida.<ql>
