   <LI> Turn on to Florida's Best Kept Secrets, two nights of blistering modern rock sponsored by ASCAP and performed by local unknowns for industry fat cats.

Showtime is 9 tonight and Saturday at Rose's Bar & Lounge, 754 Washington Ave., Miami Beach. Admission is free. Call 532-0228. <P>

   <LI> Houlihan and Dancers, a six-member modern dance troupe led by the classically trained Gerri Houlihan, performs Between Angels  to music by J.S. Bach, the duet In Your Dreams,  and the more experimental Change of Heart,  incorporating text and other theatrical elements. Showtime is 8 tonight and Saturday at the Colony Theatre, 1040 Lincoln Rd., Miami Beach. Tickets are $12 adults; $8 students and seniors. Call 661-3134.   <LI> Goooooooooaaaaaaal. To kick off the upcoming South Florida Olympic Soccer Competition in July, more than 100 volunteers will kick, push and prod a four-foot soccer ball from Jupiter to Miami. The 96-mile run started Thursday and continues at 8 a.m. today in Fort Lauderdale, winding south through Little Haiti to Miami Beach, across Biscayne Bay to Bayside Marketplace, over the Brickell Bridge through Little Havana and finally into Cocowalk at 5 p.m. today.

Admission is free. Call 373-8633.<P>

SATURDAY<P>

 <LI> John Amos -- remember him from TV's Good Times  and Eddie Murphy's Coming To America?  -- has been named the grand marshal of Opa-locka's Arabian Nights Festival. Amos will lead the Arabian costume parade starting at 10 a.m. Saturday at Northwest 27th Avenue and 135th Street, along Opa-locka Boulevard. From noon to midnight will be a concert with music by local rap, country and R&B artists and a street carnival with rides and food booths. Cameo and Michael Sterling will perform at 8 p.m. Saturday at Opa-locka City Hall, 777 Sharazad Blvd. The festival continues Sunday with a youth talent show at 2 p.m.; recipe cook-off contests at 3 p.m. and a gospel fest, featuring music by Preacher Man, Rosetta Ellis, the Rolle Family, Craig Walden, Tramaine Hawkins and Mimi Redd. Rappers Immature also perform at 8 p.m. Sunday at the Opa-locka Airport, 151st Street and Northwest 37th Avenue, Opa-locka. All events are free. Call 688-4611. <P>

 <LI> South Florida isn't exactly known for its mountains, unless you count Mt. Trashmore, which we'd rather not. But that doesn't mean we don't know a thing or two about mountain biking. Witness the two-day Bud Light Mountain Bike Festival, a 7-to-10 mile yearly cycling competition being held this year along the bike trails of Oleta State Recreational Area in North Miami. There's also a Triathlon, Slalom Challenge, Kids Competitions, a Fun and Fitness Ride and a Restaurant and Bar Charity Ride to benefit The Children's Home Society. The Mountain Bike Expo starts at 9 a.m. Sunday at Oleta State Recreational Area, 3400 NE 163rd St., North Miami. Registration fees are $20 on race day, $15 in advance. There is a $3.25 park admission fee. Registration and other events start at 3 p.m. Saturday and continue that day with a barbecue and live music at 7 p.m. The festival winds down at 3 p.m. Sunday with a party and free buffet at Shooters, 3501 NE 163rd St., North Miami. Prizes include $2,000 cash, a Diamondback mountain bike, Air South tickets to next year's festival in Atlanta and lots of sports gear. To compete, you must bring a bike and a helmet. For a complete schedule and prices, call (407) 241-3801. SUNDAY<P>

   <LI> Gravers, (that's Gothic Ravers to you and me) unite. The Church is transforming its traditionally mod interior to reflect the ``Night of the Pharaohs,'' an Egyptian-themed third anniversary party with female Arabian dancers, Egyptian statues and pyramids. The party starts at 11 p.m. Sunday at GrooveJet, 323 23rd St., Miami Beach. Cover is $10, ages 21 and under; $7 over 21. Call 532-2002. <P>

   <LI> Schmooze with Andy Garcia, Tom Arnold, Danny Glover, Arsenio Hall, Edwin Moses and Olympic athletes including Katerina Witt, at the glitzy charity brunch and auction for the South Florida Inner City Games. Items up for bid include a green BMW roadster, Hollywood memorabilia and walk-on parts in upcoming films. The event runs from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday at Planet Hollywood, 3390 Mary St., Coconut Grove. Tickets are $100. Call 673-0021.  <P>
