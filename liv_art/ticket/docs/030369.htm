TODAY<BR>
<P>

  <LI> Taste briny delicacies from more than 30 local restaurants, take the tykes on rides and games, and check out more than 100 arts-and-crafts booths and live continuous music at the Pompano Beach Seafood Festival.

Call 941-2940.<BR>
SATURDAY<P>

  <LI> Have a hair-raising time at the second annual Blowout, a mega-hair and fashion show with enough sulky looking models and stylists to curl the droopiest locks. (That's a lot.) You say you want celebrities? Peruse this emcee lineup: Melrose Place's  mad doctor, Marcia Cross; Beverly Hills, 90210's  pouty brainiac, Kathleen Robertson; Planet Soul's Nadine Renee; Naughty by Nature's Treach; Lina Santiago; and VH1's Male Model of the Year, Tyson Beckford. The Blowout benefits the United Foundation for AIDS and Health Crisis Network. It happens from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturday at Amnesia, 136 Collins Ave., Miami Beach. Tickets are $20 or $40 V.I.P. at Ticketmaster. Ages 18 and older only. Call 626-3864.  <LI> In memory of the late SNL  star Gilda Radner, Gilda's Club, a nonprofit cancer support facility, presents Live from South Florida, It's Saturday Night.  The comedy fund-raiser stars comedians Elayne Boosler and Kevin Nealon with live music by Sha-Shaty. Show time is 8 p.m. Saturday at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts, 201 SW Fifth Ave., Fort Lauderdale. Tickets start at $30. Call 963-9499.<BR>
SUNDAY<P>

   <LI> Israel Independence Day promises rides, carnival games, an art exhibit, klezmer  music, Israeli dancing, an Israeli marketplace and American and Middle Eastern dishes. Hours are noon to 5 p.m. Sunday at Soref Jewish Community Center, 6501 W. Sunrise Blvd., Plantation. Admission is free, but canned goods for the center's food pantry are requested. Call 792-6700. Also, wandering minstrels, an Israeli dance troupe, an Israeli marketplace, carnival rides and Mediterranean delicacies will be on hand from 2 to 7 p.m. Sunday at the David Posnack Jewish Community Center, 5850 S. Pine Island Rd., Davie. Admission is free. Call 434-0499.<BR>
<LI> Before Trent Reznor discovered the joys of bondage, Ministry, the two-man industrial rock duo, dominated the Gothic and alternative dance scene with metallic-riff-driven songs such as Burning Inside  and So What . We're not saying they sold their souls to the devil, but you might  say they had a little help from the underworld for their Filth Pig  album, which was recorded in a former Texas brothel that was reportedly haunted. Now, Ministry brings its rage rock to South Florida. Be afraid, be very afraid. Show time is 8 p.m. Sunday at West Palm Beach Auditorium, 1610 Palm Beach Lakes Blvd., West Palm Beach. Tickets are $25.75. Call (407) 683-6012. See page 18G.<BR>
THE REST OF THE WEEK<P>

  <LI> Catch more than rays at SunFest '96, a five-day celebration of art and music featuring 40 concerts, including some of the hippest alternative voices on radio. You'll see Joan Osborne (One of Us) , Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories (Ethan Hawkes' pushy neighbor who broke out on the Reality Bites  soundtrack with Stay)  and local rocker Mary Karlzen (who debuted with Yelling at Mary).  There's also an art show, children's activities at the NationsBank Youth Park, a food court and a fireworks show on May 3. All events are along Flagler Drive (from Banyan Boulevard to Lakeview Avenue) in downtown West Palm Beach. Hours are 5 to 10 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, noon to 10 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Admission is $8 in advance; $12 at the gate. Call (407) 659-5992. For more information, see page 18G.<P>
