<m0>  (box) South Florida isn't exactly known for its mountains, unless you count Mt. Trashmore, which we'd rather not. But that doesn't mean we don't know a thing or two about mountain biking. Witness the two-day <m0>Bud Light Mountain Bike Festival, <m0>a 7-to-10 mile yearly cycling competition<m0> <m0>being held this year along the bike trails of Oleta State Recreational Area in North Miami.

There is a $3.25 park admission fee. Registration and other events start at 3 p.m. Saturday and continue that day with a barbecue and live music at 7 p.m. The festival winds down at 3 p.m. Sunday with a party and free buffet at Shooters, 3501 NE 163rd St., North Miami. Prizes include $2,000 cash, a Diamondback mountain bike, Air South tickets to next year's festival in Atlanta and lots of sports gear. To compete, you must bring a bike and a helmet.
