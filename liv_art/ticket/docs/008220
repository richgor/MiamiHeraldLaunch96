<m0>   (box) <m0> New World closing ceremony: <m0>Richard Stoltzman, the clarinetist who can taper a tone into what often seems infinity, and who opened the '95-96 season with the New World Symphony, is coming back to help close the season Monday with his chamber group Tashi. More than ever, Tashi, a five-member ensemble once closely identified with the pianist Peter Serkin, has become Stoltzman's personal showcase. Look at the music: an excerpt from Messiaen's<m0> Quartet for the End of Time<m0>, which stars the clarinet, plus Weber <m0>and <m0>Brahms clarinet quintets. The concert, courtesy of Miami's Friends of Chamber Music, starts at 8:15 p.m. in the University of Miami's Gusman Concert Hall. Tickets cost $17; half-price for students. Call (305) 372-2975.<ep>
(box) <m0>Brazil and France bring young artists:<m0> Miami's Brazilian consul, Luiz Fernando Benedini, who leads a double life as a virtuoso pianist and enjoys presenting gifted colleagues when he can, is collaborating with the University of Miami to bring a compatriot to town. And simultaneously, the Miami chapter of Alliance Francaise, with the French Cultural Services and Coral Gables Congregational Church, are joining forces to bring a Parisian pianist here.<ep>
   The Brazilian, Ruth Serrao, teaches at Rio's main music conservatory and will bow Wednesday in the UM's intimate Clarke Recital Hall, playing 24 piano preludes (--) not the famous Chopin 24, but preludes by assorted Pan-American composers, including Villa-Lobos, Santoro, Guarneri and Guerra Peixe. Then Friday, Francois Chaplin, a winner of the 1989 Robert Casadesus Competition in Cleveland, will perform music by Debussy and Chopin at Coral Gables Congregational.<ep>
   Tickets to the Brazilian concert, which begins at 8 p.m., cost $10, $5 for senior citizens; free to students with I.D.; and can be purchased at the door. Call (305) 284-2438. Tickets to the French recital cost $18; $15 to Alliance and Congregational Church members; and $7 for students. . Call (305) 859-8760. Tickets will be also available at the door. <ep>
<m0>(box) Two pianos:<m0> Even in its off-season, the Dranoff Competition for duopianists, held once every two years in Miami, seems in perpetual motion.

Direct from a South American tour, the brothers Hans Peter and Volker Stenzel, who placed second in 1989, will play Brahms, Schubert and Lutoslawski at Miami Beach's Eden Roc hotel at 5 p.m.<ep>
  Sunday's concert will be preceded by a champagne reception, and followed by Viennese desserts. Admission, including the wine and food, is $75 and benefits the Murray Dranoff Foundation, which mounts the competition and other related two-piano projects.

<m0>   (box) Pulling rank:<m0> Tom Hanks is the king of the actors, winning the undisputed world title this month from both Premiere and Entertainment Weekly. According to Premiere's annual list of the most powerful people in Hollywood, Hanks is the highest-ranked actor (in 10th place), just ahead of Tom Cruise (11), Jim Carrey (14) and Mel Gibson (18). In Entertainment Weekly's annual Are They Worth It? investigation, Hanks ranks first in box-office draw, and is the only star that the magazine deems worth $20 million a film. Morgan Freeman is deemed ``Hollywood's most undervalued star,'' earning only $5 million to $6 million per picture. EW says he deserves $11.4 million.<ql>
