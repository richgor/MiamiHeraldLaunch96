<m1> <m0>am a symbol of black achievement.<ep>
   No, that's not <m0>me  <m0>talking. It's just something people tell me from time to time. They mean it as a compliment, but it always stops me.<ep>
   I don't want to be a symbol of black achievement. I just want to be myself, but that's difficult to manage.<ep>
   We have all become symbols, we black Americans. Have gone from the invisibility Ralph Ellison felt to the conspicuousness of icons and stand-ins. Some of us are symbols of how far we have come. Others, of how far we have not. Those are the ones who are the face of America's dysfunction: of its fatherlessness, its hopelessness, its fascination with drugs, its poverty.<ep>
   I am not here to remind you that more white Americans suffer those evils than blacks do. Rather, I wish to suggest that the Clinton administration was simply playing the game (--) albeit in reverse (--) with last week's South Florida <m0>faux pas<m0>.<ep>
   In case you're not keeping score, the president came to Carver Middle School in Miami's Coconut Grove to unveil a new anti-drug initiative. He was supposed to be introduced by a black male student, but the White House nixed that idea and told the Miami Coalition for a Drug Free Community that it wanted a white, non-Hispanic girl to present the president instead.<ep>
   Using a black student, the White House felt, delivers the message that drugs are a black thing while use of a white kid delivers a more desirable message: Drugs are <m0>everyone's<m0>  problem.<ep>
   I will resist harping on the fact that the black student, 20-year-old Taman Everett, is a man and not a message. I suppose the White House had its heart in the right place, albeit the PC one, in its attempt to stage-manage reality. But, man, when are we going to grow out of this? When will those who traffic in images and those who buy the images they sell begin to see blacks and other minorities as something other than symbols?<ep>
   No, they don't always mean any harm. But that doesn't change the fact that being reduced to a mere symbol is, invariably, a constriction, a denial of one of the fundamental blessings of being human: individuality.<ep>
   Ask your average black elected official. Sometimes I watch them and am chagrined at the stiff, unnatural formality with which they comport themselves in public. But they know they are symbols of tenuous progress, that they are on probation in the corridors of power. So one imagines them fretting that a laugh too loud, a posture too undignified, will reflect poorly upon the rest of us.<ep>
   I know they do it because I do. Many of us do. And don't you know I'm tired of the weight? Tired of caring if the new rapist in town is black and sighing in relief if he isn't and knowing that white guys don't understand and never will because the fact that the rapist is white means absolutely nothing in <m0>their<m0>  lives.<ep>
   Nor do my white friends need or seek validation in Jay Leno's success the way I do in Oprah Winfrey's. They are not proprietarily proud of him the way I am of her.<ep>
   It's telling, isn't it, that the validation I seek and the un-dignity I fear both emanate from an assumption that is also the first tenet of bigotry: that the characteristics of the one can be imputed to the many. What does it say about us that bigots and idealists sip from different sides of the same wellspring?<ep>
   Or that last week, the White House joined us? Yes, they did it from more or less pure motives, but they did it just the same. Looked at that young black man and didn't see who he was, just <m0>what<m0>  he was. Isn't that as bad in its way as denying him a job or an apartment for the same reason?<ep>
   And so it goes. Forty years ago, Jackie Robinson had to be a symbol for us. A few days ago, by his absence, Taman Everett had to be the same.<ep>
   We have traveled a long distance to get to the very same place we left. That saddens me.<ep>
   Because I don't want to be a symbol.<ep>
   I just want to be.<ql>
