   Love, he says. <ep>
  Only because he's Al Green, he doesn't just leave it at that. <m1> <m0>He slides his voice up and down the word, rubbing himself against it like a sacred talisman, building tension that bursts in the stratosphere of falsetto, the word finally stretched to fit sex and sacrament and eternity side by side. <m1> <m0>Somebody counts off the time, the guitar slides up from a primordial ooze of organ riffs and the sermon is under way. <m1> <m0>Love and Happiness<m0>.<ep>
  Ah, they don't make 'em like that anymore. <m1> <m0>In the '90s, singers think love is only a promise to ``freak you'' all night in sweat-stained sheets.<ep>
  Do you remember Love? <ep>
   Nothing against sex, mind you (--) female fans threw their undies at Rev. Al, too. <m1> <m0>But do you remember schoolboy crushes and schoolgirl swoons, constricted throats and stammered words? <m1> <m0>Do you remember slow going and finding your way and feeling yourself falling and it was like dawn breaking inside your chest?<ep>
  I don't mean to suggest that love has died. <m1> <m0>Certainly, the Hollywood fantasy factory seems to be cranking out as many love stories as ever. <m1> <m0>I still see kids sharing secret looks and guilty giggles. <m1> <m0>And you can even find a love song or two on the video channel if you listen past the ``do me'' tunes.<ep>
  But do you get the sense, as I do sometimes, that love is on its sickbed? <m1> <m0>That young people <m2><ql>

<m0>don't believe in it the way their parents did? <m1> <m0>That they nod and smile when you mention it, but that the meaning of it doesn't really reach them in their souls?<ep>
  Man, once upon a day, we thought love could make you strong enough to jump the World Trade Center. <m1> <m0>Thought it was sweet enough to make sugar hide its face. <m1> <m0>We transcribed the wisdom of poets like Smokey Robinson and Lionel Richie, thought the secrets of the ages lay between the lines of their songs. <m1> <m0>I remember looking into the eyes of girls whose names I can't even remember now, and seeing (--) I swear (--) a universe of meaning swirling there.<ep>
 Maybe we were in love with love. <m1> <m0>Maybe we had too much faith in forever. Maybe we were just crazy. <m1> <ep>
<m0>  Whatever it was, I can sense it dying in these raw and impatient times. <m1> <m0>I find myself repeating Diana Ross' plaintive question: Where did our love go?<ep>
  Not inner city Chicago, says New Yorker magazine. <m1> <m0>There, 60 percent of black adults between the ages of 18 and 44 have never been married, and one woman says the idea of staying with a single man for life is a ``fantasy.'' <m1> <m0>She says, ``I've never met many people like that, have you?''<ep>
  And it's not just a black thing. <m1> <m0>In March, the Census Bureau reported that for probably the first time in history, the majority of Americans in their 20s have never been married.<ep>
  Did our children learn to distrust love because divorce rates skyrocketed? <m1> <m0>Because ``for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health,'' was rendered a joke by marriages that ruptured the first time someone left the cap off the toothpaste?<ep>
  Or maybe it was the unforgiving tenor of our times that did it, the fact that we have exchanged old illusions for new uncertainty. <m1> <m0>And how can uncertainty make promises to eternity? <ep>
   Of course, we've always lived with uncertainty, and love has always flowered regardless. But the uncertainty is <m0>inside <m0>these days, isn't it? And that makes all the difference. <ep>
  Recently, I approached my oldest child, who will be 22 in a matter of days. <m1> <m0>Is it just me, I asked, or have people his age lost faith in love? <m1> <m0>He replied that his generation just doesn't believe in it like mine did. <m1> <m0>They don't feel any pressure to get caught up in ``all that.''<ep>
  That's what he called it, and it stopped me. <m1> <m0>The thing that made you strong enough to jump the World Trade Center is ``all that?'' <m1>  <m0>Have mercy.<ep>
  The young man who bags my groceries was talking to a couple in line the other day. <m1> <m0>They had been married 27 years and that was so amazing to him that his mouth hung open. <m1> <m0>So amazing that he tapped the checker at the next register so he, too, could see this oddity.<ep>
  Maybe we should all look while we still can.<ep>
