<m0>   A few months after Mom died, we gathered at my sister's house to sort through her belongings. It was a good day and ghosts of treasured yesteryears crowded in on us as we explored the accumulated goods of 61 years.<ep>
   Among the items I took home was an old metal pitcher. You can't drink out of it; anything it pours tastes like lead. But I wanted it because of all the times it dispensed jelly jars full of Grape Kool-Aid. I wanted it because it took me back home.<ep>
   Fascinating, isn't it, the power that objects have to evoke people, experiences and eras. Sometimes, when you hold a thing, a sense of person, place and time rush in on you with extraordinary force.<ep>
   And you know, what they've been doing at Sotheby's these last few days with Jacqueline Onassis' estate is the exact thing we did with Mom's stuff at my sister's house.<ep>
   Well, OK, minus the too-rich-for-my-blood asking prices, the sense of history, the crowds of Looky-Lous and the international interest. But the principle is the same: To know me, know my Kool-Aid pitcher. Or my monogrammed silver Tiffany tape measure, as the case may be. Either way, we are, many of us, driven by the need to retain some piece of another person's life and times.<ep>
   That seems especially true in the case of Jackie <m2><ql>

<m0>O. There is an interest in this sale for which it's hard to imagine parallel. Indeed, while Sotheby's had estimated that the four-day auction might generate as much as $4.6 million, the first day's tally ALONE was very nearly that much.<ep>
   Certainly, some of the interest is historical, and much of it is sentimental, but what ultimately lifts this event to the stratosphere of public interest is the need to fill in the blanks, piece together the puzzle, to know something more of this grand and mysterious lady who was part of our lives for more than 30 years and yet managed to reveal so little. A breathy-voiced girl in a pillbox hat becomes a brave widow mourning in grim dignity becomes a mgdern woman redefining herself in a brisk new world and still we don't quite know. . . who were you, Jackie?<ep>
   When she died of cancer two years ago, every eulogy and appreciation seemed to contain words like enigma, puzzle, mystery. We found ourselves assessing our ignorance of her.<ep>
   And appreciating it. It was refreshing, after all. Of how many public figures can it be said, we know too little? With most of them, we know too much. They give themselves promiscuously, living in a public privacy, seeming never to know the solitude of unuttered thought.<ep>
   Which is why there is something appealing about a woman who wrote no tell-all book, gave few interviews, confessed nothing at the altar of public intrusion. She lived her life and left it to others to interpret and explain.<ep>
   So we go to Sotheby's, those of us who can afford to, attempting to know at last the things she denied us. Money is exchanged and artifacts are parceled out to hands eager to take some part of her life, some part of those years, and keep it forever. We touch the things she touched, and we wonder.<ep>
   It may be foolish, but someone else will have to call it that. I feel ill-qualified to do so as the owner of a useless metal pitcher and a sudden urge to drink Kool-Aid from a jelly jar.<ep>
