<m0>   I should hate this.<ep>
   I should be thundering indignation, decrying the dumbing down of a dumb enough nation, calling a pox upon the house of television and a plague of locusts upon its rulers. In their underpants. I tell you, I really, <m0>really <m0>ought to hate this.<ep>
   Problem is, I love it.<m1><styl>cxon<ql>
<m2> <m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Nick At Nite's TV Land, that is. I haven't even <m0>seen <m0>it yet and I love it. TV Land, for those who don't know, is a new mutation of the Nickelodeon cable network. Of course, their Nick At Nite evening schedule is already rife (some would say <m0>ripe<m0>) with TV classics like <m0>The Dick Van Dyke Show, Dragnet <m0>and <m0>I Love Lucy. <m0>TV Land, Nick's new companion channel, stretches the format to a full 24 hours.<ep>
  <m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<m0> That's right, 24 mind-numbing, soul-killing hours of <m0>Petticoat Junction, Mannix, Cannon <m0>and <m0>The Addams Family. <m0>Precious time that could be spent planting a garden, reading a book, learning the piano, can now be spent chewing on used brain candy like Love <m0>American Style, Gunsmoke, <m1><styl>txt,1<ql>
<m0>Honey West <m0>and, lest we forget, <m0>My Mother the Car. <m0>Reruns, all day every day. You've seen 'em before, now see 'em again!<ep>
   Better yet, for the first year, the new channel will carry no national advertising: even the commercials will be old.<ep>
   ``I can't believe I ate the whole thing . . .''<ep>
   ``Oh, I wish I was an Oscar Mayer wiener . . . ''<ep>
   ``Plop plop! Fizz fizz! Oh, what a relief it is!''<ep>
<m1><styl>cxon<ql>
<m2> <m2><ql>
<m0>   You should know that I am wearing an appropriately sheepish expression as I admit to not hating TV Land. Yes, I know that hardly excuses the transgression, but I'm trying to save what little face I have left.<ep>
 <m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<m0>  Some experts say one of the reasons children like to view favorite videotapes over and over is because they know how the story comes out. This gives them a sense of control they don't often have in the real world. They find comfort in it. <ep>
   I used to think it was just the tykes who felt that way. But TV Land makes me wonder. Perhaps adults are not immune <m1> <m0>to the need to be comforted by known and familiar things.<ep>
   I speak as a seasoned observer of American pop culture. <ep>
   I speak as a student of human needs and wants. <ep>
   I speak as the guy who spent $20 for a <m0>Gigantor <m0>tape.<ep>
   <m0>Gigantor, <m0>for the uninformed, was a cartoon (--) a really <m0>awful <m1> <m0>cartoon (--) that aired in the early '60s. Yet I spent two years hunting down that video. I know I ought to be ashamed of myself. Somewhere inside, I am. But I used to race to the television for that show, used to sit there rooted, sucking down Chee-tos, Kool-Aid and bad animation.<ep>
   Comfort, man. The tape gave me back a piece of my childhood, restored me to a place where life was less complex and answers more readily at hand.<ep>
   Perhaps you're familiar with the concept of comfort food: mashed potatoes, pork chops, chicken pot pies and all the other stuff that made us stop crying as children (--) and that settles and centers us now that we are grown.<ep>
   Well, Nick is serving up comfort television here and the concept is much the same. When you face the unfamiliar, you want things you know.<ep>
 <m1><styl>cxon<ql>
<m2> <m2><ql>
<m0>  Certainly we can't watch these shows with the same eyes we once did. Marshall Dillon will never stand as tall in the moment as he did in the memory. You can't go home to Hooterville. We watch with a knowing now. These things have become camp.<ep>
 <m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<m0>  But they have also become comfort. Stories you've already seen and faces you know well. No unpleasant surprises. Empty calories for the soul. It's rough out there, so we value what we watched at home in the days before everything changed.<ep>
   Yes, it's vacuous, shallow and cheesy. I should hate it. I really should.<ep>
   And I'm trying, I promise.<ep>
   Now pipe down and pass the remote.<ep>
