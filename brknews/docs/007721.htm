<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Book Wars    It was chilling to read your April 21 article on Mitch Kaplan's Books & Books. This man's store is too great a treasure for this city to lose. Yes, the book megastores do have their advantages, but rarely do I buy anything. I save my purchases for Kaplan's store where the quality of service far exceeds anything the chain stores could ever dream of duplicating.    Miami readers had best see to it that Kaplan remains at the corner of Aragon Avenue in Coral Gables, or else looking for books really will be akin to shopping for lettuce at Publix. If that happened, I think I would probably give up reading.</B></I></FONT><P>

   As an author who has toured bookstores across the United States, I was gladdened by John Barry's piece. To lose Kaplan's Books & Books would be a cultural disaster for this city. But it need not end that way.<P>

   Some history: When the mall stores like Waldenbooks and B. Dalton fizzled in the 1980s, the book conglomerates looked for a new model. Their gaze fell on book sales in Michigan where back in the '60s, in Ann Arbor, Tom and Lewis Borders -- heirs to a meat-packing fortune in Memphis -- had bought out Peter Wyman's Centicor Bookshop. At that time Centicor was riding the paperback revolution to success and selling more books per square foot than any bookstore in North America. Centicor's success was so great that editors would fly in from New York to volunteer at Centicor to see how it was done.<P>

  After buying Centicor, the Borders brothers carried its financial success even further, computerizing the inventory and franchising their name. With these corporate innovations, large conglomerates got interested. Borders was sold to Kmart for over $100 million. Pleasantly formulated with espresso bars and reading nooks, Borders stores (currently Borders-Waldenbooks Inc.) have spread across the country. Like Barnes & Noble, the other big conglomerate, their teams scout the likely markets. Woe to the local store that is doing well. Megastores have allegiances to stockholders, not to books. Their job is to satisfy investors.<P>

   Despite overwhelming competition from conglomerates, superb private enterprises like Kaplan's Books & Books survive. Stores like The Hungry Mind in St. Paul, Elliott Bay in Seattle, The Tattered Cover in Denver, Black Oak and Cody's in Berkeley, The Harvard Bookstore in Cambridge, New York City's Gotham Book Mart and Books & Co, Chapters in Washington, D.C., and The Shaman's Drum in Ann Arbor, is still doing well ``in the shadow of the Borders' mother ship,'' according to manager and owner, Carl Port. So doom is not inevitable. These legendary stores have survived because of their literary excellence and because of the determined loyalty of their communities. Miami, so indebted to Mitchell Kaplan, must offer Books & Books nothing less.<BR>

   Poets are hardly strangers to anonymity, especially alongside our more visible fiction brethren. But to be the only writer left unidentified in the Books & Books group that (upper right, next to John Dufresne) is a little too symbolic, even for me. Particularly as a semi-regular contributor of book reviews to, of all places, The Herald.<BR>

   Books & Books recently came to my literary rescue when no one else could. In between my preparing for surgery and my full-time job, I was determined to participate in the Famous Women in History unit at my daughter's West Lab Elementary third-grade class.<P>

   I chose Madame Marie Tussaud, whose renowned wax museum is a favorite London attraction.<P>

   Living behind Dadeland, I was near Barnes & Noble, Borders, and Waldenbooks. However, Books & Books was the only store who said they could order the book from Oregon and have it for me in time for my presentation. A grateful thank-you to Mitch Kaplan and his hard-working, people-satisfying staff.<BR>

   Sadly, corporate chains and all that they represent are taking over every facet of our daily lives. The quality of our lives and interactions are disintegrating.<P>

   We shop at Books & Books, not simply because it is an exceptional store, but because we believe in the spirit and integrity of independent stores and services. It has come to the point where a joyous act such as buying a book has also become an important political action. Not only does it represent a choice about a way of life, but also a choice about what we read and perhaps more importantly what gets written. Sweet deals promoted by chains for big bucks will surely erode the quality of literature of our times. In fact, both the state of the book and the state of our community are in peril.<P>

  We must consider carefully whether or not to patronize any megastore that has the temerity to place its store predatorily within blocks of our community's literary mecca.<BR>
