<m1>A Mother's Reward<ql>

 <ep>
<m0>   My mother's room is at the end of the hall at The Waverly, a boarding school where old moms go to learn their last lesson in family life: how to survive on just their memories. <ep>
   I enter on quiet shoes, holding my breath. She awakens anyway. Her brown eyes, the only unfaded part about her, blink with pretend amazement.<ep>
   Her lines are always the same. Like a stage actress reanimating an old script with ironic power: ``Am I dreaming? Are you really here?''<ep>
   And then (because not too long ever elapses without her bringing up my sister's name): ``I was just talking to Holly about you. We <m0>wondered<m0> how you are.'' <m1> <m0>And (because I want her to see things clearly), I say, ``Oh, was she <m0>here?''<m0> And (because my mother is at least honest), she says, ``Well, no. You know how busy she is. But we talked on the phone.''<ep>
   At The Waverly, I'm always irked. My mother used to live in a nursing home 10 minutes from my kitchen. I would start supper, drive over, take the stairs two at a time, butter her roll, tell her about the boys, pull the curtains against the afternoon glare, and get home before the rice stuck to the pot.<ep>
   Then my sister decided to move mother to Broward to be near her.<ep>
   So I go less often.<ep>
   All right. I go seldom.<ep>
   But oddly, so does my sister.<ep>
   Even in this low light, my mother looks neglected.<ep>
   ``What's this?'' I ask examining old bloodstains rimming her nails.<ep>
   ``Oh, blood tests,'' says mother folding her hands to distract me.<ep>
   ``And they don't clean it?''<ep>
   ``By this room, they're out of Band-Aids.''<ep>
   I'm angry as usual in this close room and queasy from the stink of diapers and clouds of antiseptic.<ep>
   ``Did you notice my wheelchair out there?'' asks my mother changing the subject deftly.<ep>
   I hadn't noticed, distracted by old men sleeping bent and open-mouthed, old women padding in bathrobes and blue vinyl slippers.<ep>
   ``It happened again,'' my mother goes on. ``Two aides ran in and grabbed my wheelchair for an emergency . . . ''<ep>
   ``And didn't bring it back,'' I finish for her.<ep>
   ``And didn't bring it back,'' my mother finishes for herself. <ep>
   ``How often does <m0>this <m0>happen?'' <ep>
   My mother rolls her eyes.<ep>
   ``Do you tell Holly?''<ep>
   ``I don't like to bother her with things I can handle.''<ep>
   As I wonder what my mother can handle, she reaches for the phone, dials and waits. My mother is ``doing phone.'' A quality I admire but did not receive. On the phone, my voice goes high and breaks no matter how full of conviction my heart or honest my cause.<ep>
   My mother's tone is strong, unwavering. ``This is Judith Kane. Once again, Mrs. Winters, floor staff have removed my personal wheelchair from my bedside to rescue a wandering patient.'' She pauses to let this sink in, then goes on. ``The problem is such a commonplace I'm surprised you don't keep a folding wheelchair near the exit for contingencies.''<ep>
   My mother listens and says, ``My chair is marked front and back with my name, and I need it shortly to go to physical therapy.'' Mother listens again, now with her eyes closed.<ep>
   ``Then let me help. I can call the supervisor's office to see if someone <m0>there<m0> is free to wheel back my . . . '' Mother breaks off and says with sincerity ``Many thanks, Mrs. Winters,'' and hangs up.<ep>
   Almost immediately the chair appears. ``Shall I take you to physical therapy?'' the attendant asks.<ep>
   ``No, my daughter Elaine is visiting from . . . '' she pauses her concentration gone.<ep>
   ``Miami,'' I suggest.<ep>
   `` . . . and she'll take me.''<ep>
   My mother's eyes stay closed. Her white hair is thin. Her arms and cheeks look like she is melting imperceptibly like snow in the shade as winter wanes.<ep>
   ``Mom, do you want me to take you over to . . . ?''<ep>
   Eyes still closed, she murmurs, ``Just said that sweetheart. I don't have therapy till Tuesday.''<ep>
   Sunday morning at The Waverly ticks by. Only Holly's cards are on the windowsill. Old ones in the hall who cry out like macaws shriek and make my heart bounce. <m1>     <ep>
<m0>   ``Nononono!'' shouts a woman pushing past with a walker, arguing with no one visible. <ep>
   ``Mom,'' I finally say, ``you rest, and I'll come back.''<ep>
   ``Yes, go home to the children,'' she whispers.<ep>
   Now I feel bad. It's hardly enough of a visit, but she's tired. Dave is waiting in the lobby, wanting to complete the other 80 miles of this round trip.<ep>
   I kiss her forehead, so much like kissing the foreheads of my sons when they were little. Lightly I hold her hand and look at her nails once more.<ep>
   ``Shall I? . . .'' She folds her hands.<ep>
   ``Give my love to Bernard and the girls,'' my mother says and falls asleep.<ep>
   I go into the hall. Bernard is Holly's husband. Holly has girls. My mother may not even remember I came. <ep>
   ``How is your mother?'' Dave asks as soon as I walk into the lobby.<ep>
   ``Really good,'' I lie. ``She sends you her love.''<ep>
   He's ready to go, but I borrow a pen from the always-unoccupied reception desk. In the guest book I write our names, a little larger than the space, a little darker than necessary. I add the date and notice the last three entries are also mine.<ep>
   ``You never visit her,'' my sister once accused me on the phone.<ep>
   ``Really, I do,'' I said, my voice going tremulous and unconvincing.<ep>
   ``Well, don't bother,'' she said. ``Mother doesn't notice.''<ep>
   On the Turnpike I wonder what my mother does notice. After I visit The Waverly, I wonder about everything. The pay back on motherhood. The disarray of families. Whether people go to hell for putting their parents in places like that.<ql>
