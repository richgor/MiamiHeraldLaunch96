<m0> Q. The rust on my old refrigerator got so bad that I had to replace the appliance. I don't want the same thing to happen to my new one. The paint shops I called couldn't tell me what to do. How do you prevent rust on appliances? (--) Lee McAuley, South Miami<ep>
<m0>  <m0>A.<m0> The secret is a coat of paste car wax. Apply it to the finish to help keep out moisture and dirt, which encourage rusting. Apply touch-up paint immediately if you see any scratches. This should stop rust from forming or spreading on the exposed surface.<ep>
  Moist and salty South Florida air is the perfect environment for rust. Once rusting begins, stopping it is difficult, according to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers in Chicago.<ep>
  To prevent rust, keep appliances in an air-conditioned room, not on a porch, breezeway or outdoors. And keep them clean. Wipe frequently with a clean, damp cloth, using a mild nonabrasive cleaner. Read your owner's manual for the manufacturer's cleaning instructions.<ep>
  <m0>Q. I bought my Corvair Monza brand new in 1963. It shows its 33 years and the effects of Hurricane Andrew, but the chrome hasn't a spot of rust on it and the aluminum engine is still good. I intended to restore the car but, truth be told, I'd rather devote my restoration efforts to my 1966 Corvair GTO convertible (--) also bought new. What do I want from Action Line? A decent fate for this car. It deserves better than being sold for scrap metal. Can you find some Corvair collectors who'd like to have it for parts? (--) Andrew Zakis, Miami<ep>
  A.<m0> We found a whole lot of them when we called the Corvair Society of America. The 130-chapter organization has about 6,000 members with a soft spot in their hearts for America's first sporty small car. ``It was a quirky, different car,'' the group's Mike McGowan told Action Line.<ep>
  We gave you the name and phone number of a member of the local chapter (--) South Florida Corvairs. Others who would like to contact chapters in their area, or join the national group, can write or call the Corvair Society of America, P.O. Box 607, Lemont, Ill. 60439, (708) 257-6530. Membership is $27 a year.<ql>
