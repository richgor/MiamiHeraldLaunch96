   WASHINGTON -- (AP) -- When postal inspectors came across what appeared to be a major child pornography operation, they decided it was too good a chance to pass up. Instead of just shutting it down, they changed the name and went into business.<P>

   The results of their two-year undercover operation were announced Thursday: 45 arrests in a nationwide sting, as many as 70 more to come.<P>

   ``Simply shutting down Overseas Male (the pornography distributor) wasn't enough because those who created the demand for child pornography were still out there,'' Chief Postal Inspector Kenneth J. Hunter said.<P>

   Hunter said the investigators concentrated on people who sought videos involving boys aged 7 to 11 -- offering the material for sale and bringing charges if the individuals accepted delivery of the videos.<P>

   ``We are not talking about adult videos someone can rent at some corner video store,'' Hunter said.<P>

   The videos offered by Overseas Male were ``in actuality videotaped evidence of a crime taking place. They show images of children having sex with each other or with adults -- children as young as 7, 8 or 9 years old being sexually abused in unthinkable ways.''<P>

   In more than 20 cases, Hunter said, investigators uncovered evidence of child abuse in addition to the charges of possessing pornography.<P>

   In one case, Ray Leslie Opfer of Reno, Nev., has been sentenced to life in prison for the molestation of two brothers -- ages 9 and 12 -- after inspectors discovered a collection of sexually explicit videos of neighborhood children in his home, Postal Inspector Ray Smith reported.<P>

   In another case, authorities said Robert H. Ellison, 65, of Chicago, pleaded for the prompt return of his videos because he feared that he would molest children if he could not relieve his urges through pornography. He was ordered held without bond as a threat to the community.<P>

   ``Pedophiles aren't always strangers in your community,'' Hunter said. ``They are men of every social stratum and occupation: teachers, professors, computer programmers, even sometimes members of the clergy.''<P>

   He said his office began receiving complaints in 1993 from people who had been sent advertising for sexually explicit videos by Overseas Male, a San Diego company.<P>

   One of the operators of that business, James Leroy Kemmish, was arrested in 1994 by customs agents as he returned from Mexico. Agents found $16,000 in cash and child pornography when they searched his baggage. He has been convicted of distributing child pornography and sentenced to five years in prison.<P>

   Hunter said the agency decided to use its mailing lists to try and track down buyers of the porn. It sent out some 2,000 solicitations under the name Island Male, inviting people to send back a card if they were interested. They also had the option to ask to be removed from the mailing list or of simply throwing the solicitation away, Hunter noted.<P>

   Those who asked for more information were sent letters discussing ``steamy'' videos involving boys and men of various age groups. Those who showed an interest in ages 7 to 11 were targeted.<P>

   Smith explained that when these people placed an order, it was delivered by a postal inspector. If they accepted delivery, a search warrant was obtained and their home or business searched for evidence of possession of child pornography.<P>

   Those regarded as threats to the community or likely to flee were arrested immediately, while cases were still being developed against many others, he explained.<P>

   ``We hope it makes a difference,'' Hunter said. ``But we're not naive enough to think it will cause making child pornography or trafficking in it to end.'' He said his office makes as many as 200 arrests a year ``in this vile trade.''<P>

   In all, the postal service conducted 130 searches in 36 states during its undercover operation, called Operation Special Delivery.<P>

   He said the videos sold for from $50 to $290, depending on the age of the children involved. A review of the company's financial records showed it grossed $10,000 a week during one six-month period.<P>

   Hunter said another man believed to have been involved with the company, Troy A. Frank, was found dead in Mexico last year. Hunter said Frank was believed to have committed suicide after postal inspectors contacted him and asked him to surrender.<P>

   Many of the videos were made in Mexico, and Hunter said Mexican authorities were also investigating the case.
