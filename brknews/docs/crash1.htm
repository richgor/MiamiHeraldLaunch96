<H2>Jet Crashes Near Miami International Airport</H2>

    MIAMI -- A jetliner crashed Saturday near Miami International 
Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said. It wasn't clear if 
there were any survivors.<P>
   More than 100 people were on board Flight 592, broadcast reports 
said.<P>

   The DC-9 was headed to Atlanta and was about 30 miles outside the 
airport when it experienced problems in the cockpit, said FAA spokesman 
Anthony Willett.<P>
   Reports indicate that it was smoke, Willet said. The aircraft was 
believed to be turning around to return to the airport when radar contact 
was lost.<P>

   ``We believe that the aircraft is down somewhere in the vicinity of 
the Florida Everglades,'' he said.<P>
   The Coast Guard told The Associated Press that rescue aircraft were 
helping to look for wreckage and survivors. But all that rescue pilots 
could detect was scorched earth, Petty Officer Angela Weeks said.<P>

   ValuJet didn't immediately return a telephone message.<P>

   Atlanta-based ValuJet, which began operations in October 1993, now 
serves 26 cities in 17 states. During the second quarter 1995, ValuJet 
added Boston to its route system with nonstop service from both Atlanta 
and Washington Dulles. New nonstop service also was introduced between 
Chicago's Midway and Washington's Dulles airport.<P>

   The airline has experienced various problems in the past.<P>

   In January, a Valujet DC-9 got stuck in mud at Hartsfield Atlanta 
International Airport. The 101 passengers were bused to a terminal.<P>
   Also in January, another Valujet DC-9 with 30 people on board slid 
into a snowbank after landing at Dulles International Airport outside 
Washington, closing the airport for nearly three hours. No one was hurt.<P>

   A Valujet DC-9 also skidded off an icy runway at Dulles in January 
1994, closing the airport for almost two hours.<P>

   Last summer, the Federal Aviation Administration announced special 
inspections of aircraft engines that Valujet purchased from a Turkish 
airline.<P>

   That investigation stemmed from a June 8, 1995, fire that destroyed a 
Valujet DC-9 on a runway at Atlanta. One flight attendant was burned and 
minor injuries were reported as the 57 passengers and five crew were 
evacuated.<P>
