<m0>President's Own Political Party to Investigate His Campaign<ql>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (--) (AP) (--) President Ernesto Samper, weakened by a drug corruption scandal, now faces a probe by his own political party to determine whether he violated spending limits during the 1994 campaign.<ep>
   The ethics commission of the ruling Liberal Party decided Wednesday to investigate allegations that Samper spent more than three times the legal limit of $4 million.<ep>
   The decision is yet another setback to Samper, who is being investigated by Congress for allegations that he won the election with at least $6 million in donations from the Cali drug cartel, the world's biggest drug syndicate.<ep>
   If the lower house recommends that Samper be indicted, the case would go to the Senate and the president would have to step down temporarily during impeachment proceedings.<ep>
   If the party ethics panel finds Samper guilty, it could suspend him from the party.<ep>
   Samper has denied any wrongdoing and said campaign chief Fernando Botero and treasurer Santiago Medina, who have both implicated the president, were responsible for managing campaign funds. Both men were arrested last year.<ep>
