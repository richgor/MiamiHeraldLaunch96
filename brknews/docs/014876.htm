  Michael Sayih, 3, is crying in the doctor's waiting room. His mother lifts him out of his oversized stroller, which serves as a wheelchair, and bounces him up and down on her lap, trying to calm him, as well as herself: ``It'll be OK,'' she says over and over.<P>

   Patty Sayih is nervous. It has been over two years since she rejected the medical advice of pediatric neurologist Luis Alvarez and put her brain-injured child through a difficult series of alternative therapies instead. Now she is back in Alvarez's office, hoping he will tell her she made the right decision, that all the sacrifice and pain was worth it, that Michael has improved dramatically.<P>

   But she knows that no matter what Alvarez tells her, she still does not have what she wants most for her child. He still cannot walk. <P>

   In June 1992, Michael Sayih came into the world by Caesarean section two months early after his mother began to hemorrhage. He was small enough to fit in a shoe box. Translucent and veiny, like a baby bird. His breathing was fast and labored, his lungs weak. He was put on a ventilator in an incubator. After a tense week, Michael stabilized. Two weeks after his birth, his parents brought him home to their Northwest Dade townhouse. He should be fine, the pediatrician said.<P>

    But six weeks later, an MRI showed he wasn't fine. ``Significant brain damage,'' the pediatrician told Patty and Jimmy Sayih. He drew something that looked like a walnut on a napkin. This was Michael's brain he said. Then he burrowed dark spots in the walnut with his pen to show the problem spots. While the doctor talked about oxygen deprivation and damage in the midbrain, she stared at her second child, asleep in a hospital crib. He was small but appeared normal in every other way. Was this the best he would ever be? Would he get larger and larger but remain totally helpless like a newborn? ``Too soon to say what his future will be,'' said the doctor. ``We do know that his ability to learn and his motor skills will be affected.''<P>

   When Patty and Jimmy got to the car, Patty started to cry. She didn't stop for six months. She went over and over what she might have done wrong to cause her little boy to be brain-damaged. Maybe it was carrying his 1-year-old brother, Adam, and those heavy bags of groceries when she was pregnant. Or maybe it was the wait at the hospital to go into surgery, while she sat, hemorrhaging, in a wheelchair in admissions. Or maybe it was nothing anyone could have helped.<P>

  But regardless of what it was, the damage was done -- and would become more and more apparent as time passed.<P>

  At about 9 months, when most babies are pulling up to stand, Michael Sayih closed into a ball: His hands tightened into fists. His arms crooked shut like wings. His knees drew up under his chest. Patty tried to work his limbs the way the physical therapist (who visited an hour a week) showed her, but they always snapped back.<P>

  ``Can you imagine what it feels like to have your baby become like a frozen turkey in the freezer case at Publix?'' asks Patty.<P>

  Michael cried constantly -- a pained cry. He couldn't sleep or hold food down. Neither could Patty. She went around like a zombie. Her other child, Adam, 2, started hitting and kicking people to get attention. Jimmy found excuses to work extra hours as a city of Miami cop and go to the gym so he wouldn't have to face what awaited him at home. <P>

   In desperation, Patty took Michael to pediatric neurologist George Engle in Miami Beach hoping to hear some good news. But Engle's report was even worse: Michael was a ``quadriplegic with a significant amount of cerebral palsy.'' The child had ``considerable damage'' to the midbrain, said Engle, as well as ``a small brain.''<P>

   ``The outlook is bleak,'' Engle said. ``But there are miracles. No matter what, love him.''<BR>
<P>

  Looking back, Patty thinks this is the moment she turned away from traditional medicine: ``I felt I had to do something,'' she says. ``And there was nothing in traditional medicine.''<BR>
<BR>

Building Better Babies<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   Patty heard about the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential in Philadelphia from a friend in Colorado and sent off for information on the institutes' program for brain-injured children. When she showed the information to Michael's physical therapist, the therapist cringed and said she wouldn't recommend the program: She had recently seen a segment on 60 Minutes critical of it for being too demanding. <P>

    Patty sent for the 60 Minutes transcript but wasn't dissuaded: ``I figured I could handle demanding,'' she says. <P>

   She called Dr. Engle and asked him his opinion. Engle told her he couldn't recommend it: ``Be careful,'' he said. ``A lot of people out there will be happy to take your money.'' <P>

   The institutes, run by physical therapist Glenn Doman, have a program for brain-injured kids, and a program for ``well children'' called the Better Baby Institute. Doman claimed the ability to turn normal infants and toddlers into geniuses by challenging more of their brain-power than is normally challenged. His program for brain-injured kids is based on the same idea: Unused portions of the brain can be called into service through proper training to take over the work of the brain-injured areas.<P>

  Doman's therapy begins with the idea that learning to crawl organizes the brain for all future learning. In the case of disabled children, parents and helpers forcibly move the child's limbs to simulate crawling. Doman claims this ``patterning'' is the child's best hope to learn to crawl on his own, and ultimately walk.<P>

   Patty read Doman's 300-page book, What To Do about Your Brain-Injured Child, and was impressed. Doman claimed his work had helped thousands of brain-injured children. The book contained example after example of kids like Michael who had gone on to walk and talk. The book ended: ``Is it not obvious that all children can be all things and that giving them the opportunity to develop their brains is a joyous process for mother and child alike?''<P>

   Patty sent in the registration money. Then, she took Michael to Miami Children's Hospital to Luis Alvarez so she could document a before-and-after profile of her son with a pediatric neurologist. When she told Alvarez she was taking Michael to Doman's institute, he did not try to dissuade her: ``I told Mrs. Sayih that I thought the stimulation in that program would be good for Michael's mobility,'' says Alvarez. ``But I said I had seen it cause a lot of stress and guilt in parents, and this concerned me.''<P>

   In July of '93, when Michael was 13 months old, Patty and Jimmy Sayih arrived at the institute in Philadelphia. They couldn't get over how impressive the compound was: august stone buildings on 15 acres of rolling green lawns. Groves of trees with their Latin names at their bases. Immaculate labs and paneled lecture halls. The Sayihs were impressed to see small children -- institute clients -- play violins, scan thick books, recite Shakespeare and speak articulately about how happy they were.<P>

   Jimmy and Patty paid $4,100 (which they charged on credit cards, along with air fare, hotel and meals, because they hadn't saved enough on Jimmy's cop salary) for a week of lectures, three days of evaluations of Michael and a detailed program to take home. <P>

   The lectures went from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a 30-minute break for lunch and 10-minute breaks between classes -- barely enough time to run to the bathroom. There were no vending machines or water fountains on the compound. Each night, Patty and Jimmy arrived back at their hotel hungry and exhausted. <P>

   ``It made me start to wonder if feeling successful there was somehow tied to being uncomfortable,'' says Patty.<P>

  Rosalind Doman, Glenn Doman's daughter-in-law and the institute's associate director of Physical Excellence: ``We keep our children on strict schedules and diets, and we don't believe in having anything available that might tempt them. We also want their parents to know we mean business.'' <BR>
<BR>

A Race Against Time<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   Michael was put on a ``neurological organization program.'' Patty learned the program for Michael so she could do it herself at home. It would require a great sacrifice on her part: 12 hours a day, seven days a week of total focus on Michael.<P>

   Before having children, she had worked as a skin-care specialist at a salon. When Adam was born, she quit, thinking she'd go back to work when the kids started preschool. But now, with the demands of the institute program, she didn't have time to go to the grocery store, much less think about going back to work.<P>

    Institute literature said that ``nothing in the home should be a distraction from the teaching environment'' and the Sayihs followed the instructions to the letter: They padded the dining room table for his simulated crawling exercises. They made a slide out of Masonite so they could ``program forward motion.'' They moved furniture out so the house would provide no obstacles to crawling, in the event the patterning worked.<P>

     Flashcards replaced toys. A ``standing box,'' which Michael was strapped into in a standing position, replaced the child's highchair. A board on the floor replaced his crib so he could crawl in the night if the urge hit him. His parents strapped two feet of PVC pipes to his back when he slept so he wouldn't roll over. That way, the institute taught, he would always be on his belly, ready to crawl. <P>

   Michael's 12-hour-a-day program: Simulated crawling exercises 18 times a day. Going down a slide headfirst on his stomach 20 times a day. Hearing startling sounds -- clanking of pots, slamming of doors -- 20 times a day. Looking at 100 flashcards of printed words and accompanying pictures three times a day. Breathing exercises 56 times a day.<P>

   ``You are in a race against time,'' the manual said. ``Participate joyfully and happily.''<P>

   The breathing exercises alone took nearly six hours: Patty would place a plastic bag with a small hole at the end over Michael's face for one minute. Then give him a five-minute break. Then put the bag over his face again for one minute. Then repeat the cycle 56 times. Every day. The institute taught that the exercise forced deeper breathing, which got more oxygen to his brain. <P>

   Patty started at 8 every morning and finished at 8 every night, with the help of volunteers, which she got from advertising in the paper. Meals had to take place simultaneously with exercises to complete the program. The family would sit at the dinner table with Michael strapped to his plywood box. Patty held up flashcards with one hand and forked food in her mouth with the other. At all times, she kept a timer nearby to keep her on schedule. <P>

  Michael's knees, elbows and knuckles got raw and bloody from the forced crawling. He screamed and cried whenever his mother got near him. There was no time for joking or snuggling and little time for Adam, except when he participated in Michael's exercises. To get attention, Adam would sock the volunteers or hang on to his mother and refuse to let go.<P>

 ``I was always telling Adam to get out of the way and quit it, and always cheering Michael on,'' says Patty. ``I hope I caught on in time so Adam wasn't damaged.''<P>

   After a few months of Adam's tantrums, Patty enrolled him in a gymnastics program in the mornings. She also bought him Dr. Suess books, which she would read to him over and over during Michael's breathing exercise breaks.<P>

  As for Jimmy, Patty had time to be with him only when they were making new flashcards late at night. Patty resented his life out of the house; Jimmy resented his home being run by a timer. They both agree: ``Our family life went to hell.''<P>

   After a frenetic month on the institute program, Michael changed for the better. He quit vomiting after every bottle and started sleeping all night. Also, his arms and legs started to unlock. <P>

  ``As sick as the whole thing sounds,'' says Patty, ``it was better than doing nothing and watching him cry all the time.''    After eight months, Michael, almost 2, did something Patty considered miraculous: He crawled one inch, commando style, pulling himself forward with his upper body. In that one inch, Patty saw her son's future, a future that included walking and talking.<BR>
<BR>

Crawling for Food<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   She headed back to Philadelphia to have Michael re-evaluated for $3,000 more, which was donated by a trust fund for police officers' families. In Philly, she got a new program for Michael and much praise from institute personnel for his successes. He had ``victories'' in hearing (he flinched at loud noises), limb mobility (his arms and legs were flexible), belly crawling and flashcard awareness (he seemed to indicate the right card by looking at it on command). Rosalind Doman told Patty she had ``moved heaven and earth for Michael'' and should consider herself a ``Professional Mother.'' It was time for Michael to graduate from the ``Aspirant Program,'' said Doman, to the ``Intensive Program.''<P>

   ``Oh, great,'' Patty told her. ``like what we were doing wasn't considered intensive.'' <P>

   But Patty quickly got the hang of the new program: ``I was so psyched,'' she says, ``I came home and went at it like a freight train.'' <P>

  In addition to the old exercises, Michael was required to ``crawl for food, information, rewards and companionship.'' No more family dinners with flashcards. No more being in Mommy's arms to get a bottle. Instead, all sustenance was placed out of Michael's reach and he was told if he wanted it he had to crawl to it.<P>

  ``It seemed wrong to me to make him crawl for food and love,'' says Patty. ``But I did it anyway. I was to the point where I'd jump off a bridge on Saturday at 1 a.m., if the institute told me to do it.''<P>

   Michael got so he could pull himself commando style all over the house. His left hand opened up so he could grasp small things. Patty watched his eyes, which were crossed, move across the words and symbols on flashcards. She was certain Michael was reading, even though he didn't speak.<P>

   In six months, it was time to take Michael back to the institute to be evaluated again. Patty expected rave reviews, as before. But this time, Patty was deemed a failure. While Michael had improved, Rosalind Doman explained, he should have improved even more. The problem, Doman explained, was that Patty was ``taking so much time away from the program.''<P>

  Doman was referring to Patty's decision to seek out other mothers participating in the institute in South Florida and arrange for them to help each other. Patty had related this innovation excitedly, expecting praise. Doman frowned. This exchange was unacceptable, she said. As Patty sat in her office with Michael sleeping on her lap, Doman wrote in Patty's instructions: ``Mother must do program in her own home without the support of other parents.''<P>

  ``I tried to tell her gently,'' says Doman. ``The program is individualized for each child and there was not time to do what she was doing.'' <P>

   When Patty started to cry, Doman handed her a Kleenex and told her to pull herself together; they had work to do. Just then, Michael, who had been sleeping on Patty's lap, woke up and began to cry. <P>

   Doman told Patty to tell Michael to stop crying. When he didn't, Doman told her to put Michael outside the room on the floor in the hallway, come back in the office and close the door. Brief isolation was the way the institute dealt with the temper tantrums of an undisciplined child, Doman said.<P>

  ``I did it,'' said Patty, ``and I could kick myself for that. What kind of mother would leave her afraid, crying child alone in a strange place?''
