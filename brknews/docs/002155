<m0>On the Reef<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  As I hovered in the ocean off Hollywood Beach, I spotted something huge moving in over the reef; a tightly packed school of mullet numbering in the thousands, hundreds of thousands perhaps, because the end of the silver mass never came. In seconds there was a stratum of fish below me, without gaps or openings, that obscured all traces of the sea fans and coral heads below. The mass of mullet sped past nervously, turning this way and that, as if some telepathic message directed them. When they presented their silver sides in unison to the sun's rays they threw a blinding flash.<ep>
   Something was hunting the mullet from the underside, working and herding them in to the shallow water over the reef. Sections in the school burst into panic, fish scattering in all directions. I watched, curious how quickly they went from their run-for-it mode back to business as usual. But then I caught a glimpse of the huge shape moving below them. No longer did I feel quite so removed from the panic. ``Sharks don't hunt mullet,'' I reassured myself. ``At least I don't think they do.'' The school boiled below me. It was like watching someone crawling around under a carpet. You couldn't see the hunter, but you sure as hell knew where he was. I bent from the waist, lifted my legs above me and let gravity and the downward angle slip me toward this thing. Mullet were everywhere for a second, then they cleared a 10-foot hole and I was face to face with the most magnificent tarpon I had ever seen. He cruised regally by me, his body the color of burnished pewter, his scales the size of coffee saucers; his huge silver head bigger than a turkey platter. His eye inspected me as he circled left. His downturned mouth looked disapproving, somewhat chagrined that I was all there was. A length of shiny wire leader trailed along the side of his body, connected to a three-inch hook embedded in his mouth. I put on a burst of speed to stay longer with this incredible animal but he turned and the school of mullet closed around him. He moved off, a bump under the carpet, and headed north.<ep>

<m0>  The sun sets behind downtown's towers, most impressive from this vantage point, a gleaming range spreading unbroken from Brickell to Omni. The ships, monstrously large and improbably white, slip by like tropical icebergs a mere 100 yards from where you sit, soaking up the atmosphere and the tasty amber liquid in your glass simultaneously. Pretty kids whir past on Rollerblades toward the pier, ultralights glide by overhead with their colorful wings and lawn mower engine whine.<ep>
   This is the microbrewery behind South Pointe Seafood House in South Point Park. Inside you have fancy dining and menus that quote prices as simple two-digit whole numbers, and they don't mean cents. Outside you have a variety of delicious designer beers and Miami's most glorious aspect. Come early. At 5:30, you can be pretty sure to find a table, and if it's a Saturday, that's when the ship parade begins.<ql>
