<m0>Eating in a Georgian Manner<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  If you were Linda Georgian, you'd already know what we're going to write.<ep>
   Georgian, you see, believes she's psychic. So do a lot of folks who tune into <m0>Psychic Friends Network,<m0> the late-night, endlessly running infomercial staring Georgian and her sidekick, Dionne Warwick.<ep>
   But when Georgian isn't busy visualizing the future, she's out eating and shopping, just like anyone else. One of the spots you'll find the former Broward County phys ed teacher is the Unicorn Village Restaurant in Aventura, where she's nibbling on spinach lasagna.<ep>
   The cheesy, spinach-filled dish has been a staple since Terry Dalton, a former organic farmer in California, opened the original business in '79. Six years ago the eatery moved into a free-standing building at the Waterways.<ep>
  The aura-reading Georgian (--) who sees purity in white (--) appreciates the brightness of the decor: vaulted ceiling, light woods, skylights and enough foliage to give it that fresh, rain forest feel. Among familiar offerings such as broccoli noodle Parmesan are poached salmon with champagne saffron cream and shrimp, scallops and salmon in curry sauce. But Georgian's favorite, the spinach lasagna, is still the best seller.<ep>
   After lunch, Georgian drops by the nearby Unicorn Village Boutique, where she stocks up on feel-good crystals for her pals. She cruises the book shelves (--) books on yoga, meditation (--) always making sure her own writings are in stock, including her latest: <m0>Communicating With the Dead.<ql>

<m0>At the Gym<ql>

<m0>  The news had just come over WQAM, the sports talk station, into many of the headphones at Bally's gym in Aventura. A University of Miami football player and his girlfriend had been found brutally murdered after attending a party for NFL players at a South Beach night club until 5 a.m.<ep>
   In the steamy locker room, two men toweled off and tried to make sense of the senseless. There were no names yet, no details yet, no hint of anything nefarious, nothing but news of two bloody bodies. But they'd already heard too many stories about too many athletes in trouble.<ep>
   ``These kids, they're so young, maybe it's too much too soon.''<ep>
   ``I know. You turn around every day and some college star is in trouble. Drugs, women. They think they're above it all because they can run a football. They need more supervision.''<ep>
   ``Yep. It should be tougher but it's more than that. It's kids everywhere. Nobody follows the rules. There's no discipline anymore, no morals. Society is falling apart.''<ep>
   ``Do you know, was he a starter?''<ep>
   ``They didn't say yet. I hope not. They've got an easy schedule this year. I think they've got a real shot at No. 1.''<ql>
