  My mother was 24 years old when she fled Communist Cuba alone with three children under 5 and an anxiety that surely must have gnawed away at her heart. She didn't know if she would ever again see her mother or my father, who had gone underground. She didn't know what future awaited her on foreign shores.<P>

  Where do you find the courage to do this? How do you gather the strength to face the uncertainty of a new life?<P>

  I ask myself these questions on a Mother's Day 35 years after the four of us walked hand in hand down the corridors of the Havana airport because I'm not sure that at 24 I could have done what she did. I'm not even sure I could have done it at 39.<P>

  She believes differently: You can do anything.<P>

  I grew up believing what she told me. I can do anything. It was a tough and tricky lesson to teach in a culture full of constraints, where women learn early on to know their place, where too often their lives are spent compensating for their men.<P>

  Yet, she managed to teach well, and not only in words but primarily and more importantly through her own actions. I was taught the infinite nuances of subtle strength and quiet courage, about the incredible power of convictions. I was taught to not be afraid of pain, to face it head on, suffer through it and come out clean in the end. I was taught the dignity of being a lady, and how that and tenacity are not mutually exclusive. I was taught the value of sincerity, the satisfaction of hard work and the healing potential of forgiveness -- for others and myself.<P>

  And that is just the short list, the lessons that can be put into words. As we grow older together, mother and daughter, I am learning a new lesson: about the commanding role a mother plays in a child's life. At an intellectual level, I have long known the importance of that irrevocable bond. Now, through experience with other adults and with my own children, I understand with my gut and my heart as well.<P>

   A mother is the central builder of a solid foundation, the invisible engineer who raises the bridges to future relationships. Through her and with her, we learn to trust, to be intimate, to accept and give of ourselves. Her love is yardstick and buoy, haven and catalyst.<P>

  The symptoms of a broken relationship with a mother spread far into the future. What we have -- or don't have -- with her affects the way we make our friends, how we love our mates, the way we treat our own kids. Yes, children can and have overcome the fissures of a cracked relationship with our first and foremost love, but that is rare and as difficult as anything we will ever do.<P>

  As a widowed mother of five children, this insight is something that weighs heavily on my shoulders; it colors everything I do. I have grown keenly aware of the consequences of parenting, but also grateful to have a model to copy. As a sometimes baffled seamstress in the fabric of my children's life, I know, with a gratitude that is immeasurable, that there is nothing quite as useful as having a pattern with which to guide scissors and stitch.
