<m0>  ``Mother has to have a triple bypass. Tomorrow.''<ep>
   My sister's words, spoken as I stepped off an airplane in Memphis, shocked me with their terrifying simplicity.<ep>
   This is it, I thought. My mother is going to die.<ep>
   She didn't. But in those first few hours after surgery, with all those infernal tubes sticking out of her, she looked awfully frail for a woman who thought nothing of driving 100 miles to Memphis in the morning to shop and then driving 100 miles home again that night. At the age of 77.<ep>
   For days, I loyally haunted her bedside, watching her regain strength, watching her force herself to walk down long gloomy hospital corridors with exaggerated slowness. She was getting better and I could see it.<ep>
   So why did I feel so uncomfortable, so <m1> <m0>. . . <m0>guilty<m0>?<ep>
   I first noticed it when I tried to make small talk and realized that we had very little to talk about. And little wonder. For 13 years now, I have lived in Miami, returning home once, maybe twice a year for visits that seem to end almost before they begin. Before that, I lived in Atlanta. And before that, West Palm Beach and Hallandale. It has been 27 years since I left home for good. We had both built our own lives, far away from each other, and it was hard to reach back through the years and grab that easy familiarity a young boy has with his mother.<ep>
   I felt bad that I had not spent more time with this woman who had given me life itself. Somehow, as childhood passed into adulthood, an emotional distance developed between us, aided no doubt by our physical separation.<ep>
   Years ago, when I discovered my father had cancer, I wept unabashedly. When he died, I wept uncontrollably before his casket. Why did I feel no wave of grief now, with my own mother's mortality staring me in the face?<ep>
   I knew it wasn't because I resented my mother for any real or imagined slight of childhood. I knew she had been nothing but a wonderful mother, dedicated to my well-being, insightful, loving, generous.<ep>
   When I was a boy, terrified of learning how to drive, my dad forced me behind the wheel, ordered me onto the road, and watched in horror as I drove through a picket fence at 50 miles an hour.<ep>
   My mother quietly whispered all the following week that I didn't have to drive until I was ready, but that she could tell I would have no problem now that I had gotten my feet wet. The next weekend, she cajoled me into driving her out to the country club and coolly praised my performance. I was driving in no time.<ep>
   As a young boy, I was paralyzed by shyness. Mother would take me with her to her friends' homes and smoothly pull me into conversations with the adults. Before I knew it, I was enjoying being the center of attention.<ep>
   In this Mother's Day issue, three stories speak to the irrevocable bond most of us have with our mothers (--) the cover story (page 6) on the remarkable lengths to which Patty Sayih has gone to help her brain-damaged son; a fictional sketch of one woman's battle with pain and guilt over her mother living in a nursing home (page 4); and Ana Veciana-Suarez's column (also page 4) about the commanding role a mother plays in a child's life.<ep>
    I knew <m1> <m0>my lack of emotion did <m0>not<m0> mean my mother had no such grip on my life. And yet, there it was, this inner detachment so out-of-step with these circumstances. All week, I sat with her, issuing a steady stream of sympathetic chatter and concerned expressions, then on the day I had to catch my plane, I kissed her goodbye and walked out of the hospital room, accompanied by my stepfather and that odd ill ease.<ep>
   When I got to the elevator, I turned to say goodbye to him and suddenly burst into tears. I began to sob. My body shook violently. I couldn't stop. ``Can't talk,'' I sobbed. ``Oh boy,'' he said, ``your mama's gonna be all right.'' Still I sobbed. We hugged each other. And, still crying, I turned and fled down the elevator.<ep>
   I suddenly realized the tears had been there all along. I had just been so afraid of them, so fearful of confronting that long-buried dependency, that primal fear of losing your mother, that I had managed to distance myself. Until I walked out that door and knew I was about to put 1,500 miles between me and my mother one more time.<ep>
   And I cried like a little boy.<ep>
