<m0>   There were no members of the male sex at my high school, Saint Joseph's Academy, not even a groundskeeper. In Tucson, Ariz., what would grow anyway? Cactus and sagebrush, of course, watered by the kindness of God's rare rainfalls (--) once in November then maybe again in March. <m1> <m0>The atmosphere was dry in more ways than one; my mind was filled only with the awesome question of ``Will any boy call me on the telephone tonight when I get home after school?'' My preference was Frank O'Connor, the most sought-after boy in school, but I might as well have expected William Holden to show up at my front door. ``Ask and you shall receive'' doesn't apply to crushes on boys.<ep>
   I was popular with girls and most of the nuns except Sister Isadore. She gave a sex lecture every few weeks to all 12 of the senior girls and explained to us about conception and childbirth. ``How does she know so much?'' I whispered once loud enough to be sent from the room in disgrace. Some girls giggled outright; if you were rich you could get by with anything. I was poor. My mother, a Southern Belle who had fallen on hard times, was widowed a few months before we moved to Arizona to help my asthma and because my older brother was <m0>persona non grata<m0> at most of the Deep South colleges. He had bought a hearse after high school from a mortician, then painted it a bilious green and followed the rest of the family out West after we settled in Tucson. If our family car suddenly had a dead battery or engine trouble I rode to school, church, grocery shopping or to the few parties I was invited to in the green hearse. I hid on the floor while my mother drove with the dignity of a queen. Easy for her. She wasn't in love with Frank O'Connor.<ep>
   I always asked to be let out of the hearse a half-block away from the destination, checked my makeup under the nearest street light and with my Southern accent managed to be popular.<ep>
   The first time Frank O'Connor saw me being driven to a get-together in the green hearse I almost sobbed with embarrassment. ``Whose is it?'' he asked.<ep>
   ``It belongs to my oldest brother,'' I wiped away tears.<ep>
   ``Cool,'' Frank said. ``Would he let me drive it someday? Hey (--) we could fill it up on Saturday afternoon with some real live ones and have a bash at Sabino Canyon. Will he lend it to us, do you think?'' My tears dried and I walked into the party like a princess showering gifts.<ep>
   A week later on Saturday my mother bribed my brother into lending me the green hearse. The lunch she fixed for us was beautiful, a bucket filled with iced Coca-Colas, fried chicken, sandwiches and chocolate cake.<ep>
   Frank arrived alone and told me we'd pick up our other friends later. He pushed the soft drinks aside for his container of many bottles of cold beer. After he found a deserted place by the stream in the canyon, he stretched out a blanket on a flat beige boulder and drank one beer after another, then pushed me down against the blanket.<ep>
   ``Loosen up,'' he said hoarsely and pulled me closer to him. I listened to the gurgle of the stream, the scampering of gophers and other little desert creatures while he drank more. Then he pinned my shoulders against the blanket and kissed me. He smelled like stale beer and fried chicken.<ep>
   ``Take me home,'' I said. ``I think something just died around here.''<m2><ep>
