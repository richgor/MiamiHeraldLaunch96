    All his life, environmentalist Nathaniel Reed has seen in Florida's natural resources both a lush setting to indulge his life of privilege, and an underdog in need of his passionate defense. ``I have a streak for the loser in me,'' he says. Wrapping up his third term on the powerful South Florida Water Management Board, he recalls how 40 years ago he found a cause for life.<P>

  ``My beloved Florida was being raped, destroyed. I wrote; I spoke. I had the funds to be able to travel extensively by small plane wherever there was a fight.'' <P>

  A lifelong Republican, Reed was brought into public service by Gov. Claude Kirk. He was asked to stay on by Florida's next five governors, and served as assistant secretary of the Department of the Interior under presidents Nixon and Ford. His r&eacute;sum&eacute; lists his battles: from stopping the Cross Florida Barge Canal to imposing boating speed limits to save the manatee to restoring the Kissimmee River. His most recent success, for which he claims ``deep-in-the-background'' credit, is the congressional promise of $200 million to purchase land in the Everglades.<P>

  ``I'm a Republican appointed by a Democratic governor: I'm trying to get the most out of both parties.''<P>

   Reed split his childhood between cool green lawns of suburban Connecticut and the ultra-exclusive Florida retreat of Jupiter Island, developed by Reed's father, Joseph V. Reed, a New York theater producer. Reed passed the winter months surrounded by neighbors with names like Vanderbilt, but living a life like Tom Sawyer, loading up a red wagon with fishing poles, and towing it on the back of his bicycle down to the mangroves to fish.<P>

    Reed still travels the same trail, by golf cart now, wedging his six-foot five-inch frame next to his ubiquitous Brittany spaniel for the short scoot along an island road from home to office. Reed is gradually scaling back his duties at the Hobe Sound Co., where he has a real estate business and runs the island's water service; his retirement will coincide with the expiration of his third term on the board of the South Florida Water Management District; he will have served 12 years.<P>

  ``I'm going to write a couple of books,'' says Reed. ``One on my fishing exploits. And one on what Florida could be. We know what we got, and we know where we're heading if we don't change our ways.''<BR>
Your idea of fun?<BR>
I fish in lovely places. I like to fish out of a long canoe, or wade. I wade alone -- if I drown, I'll drown alone. In July, I fish in Norway for salmon, and lately I fish for permit [a giant pompano], and you need a boat. But my guide is silent. We'll go two or three hours without talking.<BR>
What makes your marriage work?<BR>
My wife [Alita] was my next-door neighbor. But she and I are totally different. She's a brilliant financier, which I am not. And she's a very good mother, whereas I'm a doting father -- discipline isn't my strongest suit.<BR>
The key to success?<BR>
Never be overstaffed. Never be scared of brilliance. And keep everybody busy -- so they're never fighting over who gets what job.<BR>
Your defining moment? <BR>
The decision to go to Tallahassee [in 1966, under Gov. Kirk]. I could have lived a life of playing farmer, chasing cows, growing oranges, raising my three children and catching fish. Instead I've devoted 30 years to government, business and education.<BR>
Worst fault?<BR>
I seem to attract a lot of mail, and I have a very serious character defect, which is that I cannot stand to see unanswered mail. I try to have a clean desk every day.<BR>
An enduring trait of childhood?<BR>
I was always raising butterflies. It takes a lot of time to cut the branches and clean out the cages, but they have always been a passion. I try not to admit it now; at 62, if you say you collect butterflies, you can get laughed at.
