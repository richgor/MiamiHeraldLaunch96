<m0>UN Envoy Says Troops Should Remain in Haiti Possibly Into Next Year<ql>

   UNITED NATIONS (--) (AP) (--) Peacekeepers may have to stay in Haiti into 1997 to insure stability even though their mandate expires in June, the U.N. special representative for the island said Thursday.<ep>
   Enrique Ter Horst told reporters ``it is clear'' that Haiti's new national police force ``is not in a position to take over the securing of a stable environment.''<ep>
   About 1,900 U.N. peacekeepers and 300 international police are in Haiti as part of a scaled-down mandate approved by the Security Council in February.<ep>
   Ter Horst said he considered the figure of 1,900 troops to be the ``indispensable minimum ... to protect our (U.N. civilian) police'' who are spread throughout the country.<ep>
   But the United States, France and others on the council were barely able to extend the mandate at all in February because of opposition by China and others who believed the United Nations was spending too many resources on the Caribbean country.<ep>
   China threatened to veto an extension past February because of Haiti's links to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province. China relented and allowed a four-month extension of a scaled-down mission after Canada agreed to send 700 soldiers at its own expense.<ep>
   U.N. troops were sent to Haiti in March 1995 to replace the U.S.-led multinational force that restored President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power the previous October. Rene Preval succeeded Aristide in February after national elections.<ep>
   At its height, the United Nations had about 6,000 peacekeepers in Haiti, including 2,400 Americans. Nearly all the U.S. troops were withdrawn early this year.<ep>
   Ter Horst said the major domestic threat came from criminal gangs rather than supporters of the regime removed under U.S. pressure before Aristide resumed power.<ep>
   Ter Horst said he briefed the council on Wednesday, telling its members that ``despite our efforts to speed up our departure, our presence would still be required for some time.<ep>
   ``I also said that the police would probably be fully operational by the end of next year, and it will naturally be necessary to monitor its progress constantly,'' he said.<ep>
