   <FONT SIZE=+3>Investigation continues<BR>
                      into double UM slaying<BR></FONT>

      Tucked in Charlie Postell's drawer is a scrapbook, a
 compilation of photos and clippings of her son's brief football
 career.<BR>

    <P> The last entry was a Herald article from Thursday.</P>
 <IMG SRC="marlgrie.jpg" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=221 HSPACE=15 VSPACE=2 ALIGN=LEFT>

<FONT SIZE=-1><B>GRIEVING:</B> <I>Friends of murdered UM football player, Marlin Barnes, L to R.,  Lisa Joseph, Lisa Binns and Lisa's sister,  Keisha Binns, during speech by UM President Foote at the student union on UM campus.</I></FONT><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=LEFT SIZE=1>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<BR>        <P>   In the back room of Elizabeth McQueen's house are piles of
 boxes filled with her granddaughter's belongings. They will
 probably never be unpacked.</P>

 <P>   "This is where it stops," Postell said, flipping through
 the mementos she began collecting when her son wore No. 11 at
 North Miami High School. "It can't go any further, and look at
 all these empty pages. When you start something, you're supposed
 to finish it."</P>

   <P>   Future articles about her son Marlin Barnes will not be
 about his linebacker moves for the University of Miami
 Hurricanes. They'll be about how he and his friend Timwanika
 Lumpkins were found dead Saturday at Barnes' UM apartment.
 Beaten to death.</P>

  <P>    The killer has not been caught. Detectives spent Sunday
 casing the apartment, carrying out carpeting and furniture from
 the murder scene -- Apt. 36C.</P>

   <P>   "I was up all night thinking about who would want to do
 this to him," Postell said. "I can't think of anyone. He never
 did anything to hurt anybody."</P>

     <P> Lumpkins' family wishes they could say the same.</P>

    <P>  Her grandmother Elizabeth McQueen said her granddaughter,
 nicknamed "Little Bit," moved back home about a week ago, saying
 her boyfriend of nearly four years had roughed her up. Barnes, a
 friend from North Miami High, helped lug her boxes.</P>

      <P>Last week, Lumpkins, 22, told the grandmother who raised
 her that she was going to get a restraining order against her
 ex-boyfriend, a rapper from Northwest Dade.</P>

      <P>"I told her a restraining order doesn't stop nobody from
 killing nobody," McQueen said. "You see all these people on TV
 getting killed with restraining orders? You know what that does?
 It makes them madder. She never did get it. She didn't have
 time."</P>

      <P>McQueen said Lumpkins' ex-boyfriend, with whom she has a 3-
 year-old daughter, Antonesha, came to McQueen's South Miami
 home Sunday to gather clothes for the girl. McQueen wouldn't let
 him in.</P>

     <P> "I asked him what on earth is going on," she said. "He said
 he wished he knew."</P>

      <P>Police were not calling the ex-boyfriend a suspect.</P>

         <P>Metro-Dade police spokeswoman Lt. Linda O'Brien said,
 "He, along with everyone else, is being interviewed. They're
 talking to people, friends and relatives. Generally, a friend
 knows a friend, who knows another friend who knows another. Most
 murders are committed by someone who knows the victim. There's a
 lot of legwork to be done."</P>

      <P>Lumpkins' former boyfriend did not return calls left on his
 pager and could not be reached at his mother's house.</P>

      <P>Police would release no further information.</P>

      <P>Lumpkins and Barnes spent their last hours at a Miami Beach
 nightclub that was hosting a party for the Miami Dolphins and
 Dallas Cowboys.</P>

      <P>Barnes called his mother Friday afternoon, asking if he
 could use his credit card -- for which she paid the bills -- to
 buy a new shirt for the party. Lumpkins wore a black satin
 dress. Before she left, she kissed her grandmother goodbye.</P>

   <P>   "She looked so pretty," McQueen said.</P>
      Barnes and Lumpkins were found dead the next morning by UM
 safety Earl Little, Barnes' roommate and best friend.

     <P> Now two families are reeling.</P>

         <P>Barnes' mother sat stone-faced in her Carol City home,
 surrounded by family and friends. Calls poured in. Former UM
 football coach Dennis Erickson called. UM President Edward "Tad"
 Foote came over and embraced her.</P>

      <P>Barnes, 22, attended Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia
 before going to UM. He was a member of Right Trac, a mentoring
 organization.</P>

      <P>His father, Mackey Barnes, was murdered 20 years ago by his
 best friend. Marlin Barnes grew up in the James E. Scott Homes
 project in Liberty City.</P>

      <P>Lumpkins graduated from North Miami High. She ran track and
 liked playing basketball. She had a job working with computers,
 her grandmother said.</P>

    <P>  "She was the sweetest person you've ever seen in your
 life," McQueen said. "She never had a frown on her face."</P>

      <P>The killings cast a pall Sunday on the university's
 reception for prospective freshmen and transfer students, who
 were greeted by an onslaught of media covering the grim news.</P>

      <P>Foote spoke to about 1,200 prospective students and their
 families.</P>

      <P>"You are here one day after a terrible tragedy occurred on
 this campus that took the lives of two young people, one of whom
 was a student here. It is a very rough moment," he said.
 "Instead of the enthusiasm and excitement we hoped to welcome
 you with, you are here on a day of mourning."</P>

        <P> He told them that Metro police had three teams of
 homicide detectives on the case and that campus security had
 been considerably increased. He later told media that there were
 about 40 Coral Gables police and private security officers
 assigned to campus security, at least 15 more than usual.</P>

     <P> "Should you decide that despite your interest in this
 university you should go elsewhere, that is a decision you have
 to make," he said. "I personally would not make that decision.
 This is a safe place to live and study."</P>

      <P>The prospective students and their families expressed
 concern, but none interviewed said the killings had convinced
 them to stay away from UM.</P>

     <P> "It's scary, but I can't let it affect me," said Jennifer
 Chasen, 17, of Boca Raton. "This is where I want to be next
 year. And I've been on campuses of other schools where there was
 no security at all."</P>

      <P>Her mother, Andrea Chasen, said they had gone to the
 dormitory where Jennifer will live, found that pass cards with
 bar codes were needed to enter the building and had spoken with
 a resident assistant about security.</P>

     <P> "I assume the dormitories are more secure than the
 apartments where the murders happened," she said. "I'm feeling
 secure about her safety, and I know my daughter is mature enough
 to take precautions."</P>
