   WITNESSES CALLED POLICE Friday at 11:36 a.m. after seeing three men loading goods taken from a home in the 20500 block of Manta Drive into a 1979 Buick Le Sabre. As officers arrived at the scene, one spotted a car matching the description traveling slowly on Southwest 117th Avenue toward 248th Street. He began following it. When the car ran a stop sign, the officer signaled the driver to pull over. Instead, the car continued west on 248th Street, continuing even after the right rear tire blew out. When the tire was completely shredded, the car turned onto Southwest 137th Court and two of the robbers fled. The driver was arrested.
