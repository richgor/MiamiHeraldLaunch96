   Tom Blakey is a little upset.<ep>
   Since last May, he has been leading a drive to have his neighborhood incorporated. But he has been ignored, he said.<ep>
   Blakey lives in a section of East Kendall called Killian Gardens. It is bordered by 84th and 137th Streets to the north and south, and U.S. 1 and 97th Avenue to the east and west.<ep>
   East Kendall also is trying to become a city, but isn't nearly as far along as Killian Gardens, Blakey said.<ep>
   Yet East Kendall has been getting all the headlines, he said. <ep>
   ``Not only has the county ignored us, but the media have, too,'' Blakey said. ``[Gonzalo] Sanabria has five people over for lunch and there's an article in the paper.''<ep>
    Sanabria is an East Kendall resident who lives in Killian Gardens but is supporting a drive to have East Kendall incorporated. Sanabria also is chairman of the Dade County Planning Advisory Board, a group that recommends whether an area should or should not vote on incorporation. <ep>
   Sanabria said East Kendall has filed all necessary applications for incorporation and is awaiting a statement from the country showing East Kendall's revenues. He doesn't believe Killian Gardens can cut it as its own city. <ep>
   ``I don't think it's viable because of its small size,'' Sanabria said. ``He may think it's comparable to Pinecrest, but Pinecrest has a much higher tax base than Killian Gardens.''<ep>
   Killian Gardens' average household income is about $60,000 per year. Pinecrest's is just over $87,000.<ep>
   Blakey began petitioning the Metro Commission for cityhood in March of last year. The commission has yet to place Killian Gardens on its agenda, he said. <ep>
   He said the area is similar to Pinecrest. There are 20,000 residents and about 10,000 electors. The county requires a petition signed by 4 percent of the electors before reviewing incorporation. Killian Gardens has 505 signed petitioners (--) about 5 percent of the electors.<ep>
   ``There's no other group with petitioners filed downtown,'' Blakey said, referring specifically to East Kendall and its 55,000 residents.<ep>
   That's true, said Sanabria, but the county didn't require petitions last year when East Kendall began its incorporation movement. ``But, we're going to do it shortly, anyway,'' Sanabria said. <ep>
   If the commission doesn't agree to hear from the folks at Killian Gardens, Blakey said he may have no option but to challenge the county through the legal system. That's an expensive option, he said. <ep>
   His reasons for seeking incorporation are not much different from other areas in the same situation, such as Palmetto Bay and East Kendall.<ep>
   ``We want to have control over our own affairs and our own zoning,'' Blakey said. ``We want to have control over our own destiny.'' <ep>
