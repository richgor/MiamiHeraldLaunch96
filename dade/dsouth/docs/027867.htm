   Homestead government and business officials plan once again to express their opposition to Biscayne National Park's proposal to keep at least 2,700 acres adjacent to the park as agricultural or open space to preserve the water quality of Biscayne Bay.<P>

  Officials in Homestead want development allowed.<P>

   The Homestead City Council voted last month to oppose the requests by the U.S. Department of Interior, the National Park Service and Biscayne National Park to amend Dade County's Comprehensive Development Master Plan -- the county's blueprint for growth.<P>

   The Metro Planning Advisory Board endorsed the proposal April 19. The issue now is expected to go before the Metro-Dade Commission May 14.<P>

   Homestead officials plan to attend that hearing to repeat their arguments.<P>

    ``We are trying to make it economically viable for current residents and for the people who are migrating to this part of the county,'' said Councilwoman Ruth Campbell. ``The amendments will stymie the development at the Homestead Air Reserve Base.''<P>

   Homestead business community members also plan to show why the area should not forced into a buffer zone for the underwater park.<P>

   ``When we're looking at is a community that has lost 8,000 to 10,000 jobs and not replaced them, these kinds of amendments strike right at the ability to create jobs,'' said Richard Bauer, president of the Vision Council, which promotes economic development in South Dade.<P>

    The area is designated by the county as an Urban Expansion Area, which may be developed in 10 to 20 years.<P>

    But Biscayne National Park Superintendent Dick Frost said that could ruin the fragile nature of Biscayne Bay. <P>

   ``Fresh water is a key element in keeping Biscayne Bay healthy. We know there is a direct connection between having that open space to filter and clear the water the condition of the bay,'' he said.<P>

   Robert Usherson, chief of the county's Metropolitan Planning Division, said his department opposes the amendments because they are not necessary.<P>

   ``We think that if and when this land was added to the urban development boundary, land regulations and water management regulations would protect the park from any ill effects of urban development,'' he said.
