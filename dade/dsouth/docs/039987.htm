     Editor: After following the progress of the Homestead Air Reserve Base, I feel I can no longer sit back and pass it off as politics. This is the perfect reflection of the problems we are having in all of Dade County. I personally am tired of our elected commissioners forgetting why they are in office.<P>

   I was born in Dade County and grew up in what is now called Kendall. We had a wonderful park program. ``The Park'' was within walking distance of our home, and had a variety of different things for us to do (ping-pong, tennis, playground, baseball, football, etc.) As you look back on my childhood you will find the fond memories of the days I spent at ``The Park.'' I am sure that this has kept me out of a lot of trouble, because we were never lacking in good honest fun.<P>

   It saddens me when I look at my two daughters Ashley, 10, and Tori, 3, and realize Dade County is no longer a place for children. Every year since my oldest has been able to enjoy the park system (swimming lessons and swim team) our local park (Cutler Ridge Park) has had budget cuts. Therefore, the programs are either shortened or completely removed. How can we as parents raise a well-rounded child on a middle-class income without our parks?<P>

   When you listen to the news and hear of all the problems our youths are facing, how can the commissioners even consider not allowing the park to stay. Why is it that we have a group of commissioners who seem to be well educated, intelligent individuals and they can not see a correlation between BORED youths and TROUBLED youths.<P>

   I don't understand how Commissioner James Burke can put a dollar amount on the well being of our youth. I am very disappointed in your comments in the Miami Business Review that ``It would be nice to have a park, but if that means fewer jobs, I'd have to object.''<P>

  And to Commissioner Natacha Millan: If I am not mistaken it was the Metro Commission that voted on the Air Reserve Base with the park included. Why all of a sudden would the park in your view be history, also per Miami Business Review.<P>

   My personal belief is that we have the age old scenario of HABDI saying ``Jump'' and commissioners saying ``How high?''<BR>
