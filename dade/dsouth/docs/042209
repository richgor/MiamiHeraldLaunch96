<m0>     Three men were arrested April 30 and charged with committing an armed carjacking and aggravated assault at the Florida City Super 8 Motel, <m0>1202 N. Krome Ave.,<m0> at 11:32 p.m. April 28.<ep>
     According to police, the three men, Cedric Lester, 20, of 942 NW Third St., and two juveniles were riding in an older model pickup when they noticed a woman sitting in a car. Two of the suspects got out of the truck, ran to the victim's car, pointed firearms toward the woman's face and ordered her to get out.<ep>
     The car was quickly stripped of its $3,000 stereo equipment, steering wheel, motor, transmission, tires and rims, rim caps and front caps with headlights. The vehicle was then towed and later burned.<ep>
     It was recovered by Metro-Dade Police on April 29 in the 300 block of Southwest 192nd Avenue. An investigation uncovered much of the vehicle's equipment at Lester's house along with receipts with the name of the car's owner. Police also found the wallet belonging to the victim of another robbery that occurred on April 28.<ql>
