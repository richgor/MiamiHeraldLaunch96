<!-- end headlines -->

   Members of the Cutler Ridge Woman's Club came home from the Florida Federation of Women's Clubs 101st annual convention with a top prize.<P>

   The club won the first-place award for its work with the Cutler Ridge Regional Library. Attending the convention and bringing home the good news were club President Aileen Warford; President-elect Mary Cross; and Helen Kucherak. <P>

   During the past year, the club also has sponsored a little girl from Senegal as part of the Child Reach Program, a project of the General Federation of Women's Clubs.<P>

   The club also has been able to donate money to projects such as the Everglades Youth Camp, Camillus House Medical Clinic and Safe Space.<BR>
Honors from Elks<BR>
<P>

   More than 350 children, parents and volunteers were honored recently by Elks Lodge 948 during a celebration of the organization's National Youth Activities Week.<P>

   Members of the 88-year-old lodge at 10301 Sunset Dr., bestowed honors for various achievements and special recognition was given to Amy Hirth, 16, a junior at Palmetto High School.<P>

   Amy is a member of the National Honor Society, English Honor Society, Art Honor Society, Science Honor Society and the Key Club, said Frank Jackson, the lodge's scholarship chairman. He presented her with her award.<P>

    Lodge officers also presented plaques to Amy, other outstanding young achievers and volunteers who helped in the lodge's 16 youth-oriented programs, Jackson said. <P>

  Author and television performer Judy Gail, of Kendall, entertained the group.<BR>
Teen actors<BR>
<P>

   The Sylvia Orkin Holocaust Impact Theatre is starting another season of educating and performing for South Florida Schools, churches and synagogues.<P>

   The troupe, which consists of 13 members from area high schools, was born last year as a venue to explore the dehumanization that resulted during the Holocaust, said Sharon Socherman, the group's education director. <P>

   This year the troupe is exploring all aspects of prejudice and discrimination and portions of the performance includes skits on anti-Semitism, racism, child abuse and homelessness.<P>

   Along with Socherman of Kendall and artistic director Kate Denson of South Miami, the teens write, produce, stage and direct their own scenes, Socherman said. Performances last 45 minutes and are followed by question-and-answer sessions.<P>

   The next performance is at 8:15 p.m. Monday at Temple Samu-El Or Olom, 9353 SW 152nd Ave. It is free.<BR>
Pleasant surprise<BR>
<P>

  Members of the Coral Gables Junior Woman's Club recently got an added lift while rehearsing for this year's Cabaret fund-raiser.<P>

   They received a $12,000 grant from the Dr. John T. Macdonald foundation. The grant, written to help support the club's May Van Sickle Free Children's Dental Clinic, was almost twice the amount requested, said club Vice President Betsy Britton of Kendall.<P>

   Although the grant helps keep the clinic's doors open, club members are still counting on the proceeds from Cabaret to supply the funding the club needs to provide more than $110,000 annually in free dental care for needy children.<P>

   The 58th annual Cabaret, ``Rockin' to the Rhythm,'' will be at 8:15 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 2 p.m. May 19 at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts, 174 E. Flagler St. Tickets range from $15 to $35 and group rates are available. Call 255-9785 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., or 253-5038, or Ticketmaster 358-5885, both any time. Limited number of tickets available at door.<BR>
Centennial show<BR>
<P>

 Outreach programs of the St. Augustine Church Ladies Guild will benefit from a style show and luncheon this week that salutes Miami's 100th birthday and will feature clothes of the 1800s and 1900s.<P>

   Also featured during the fund-raiser will be the Miami Beach High School jazz band, a centennial score by Carolyn Davenport and a raffle.<P>

   The centennial event starts at 11 a.m. Saturday at the parish hall, 1400 Miller Rd., Coral Gables. Tickets are $20 per person and reservations should be made by Thursday. Call 261-6196 or 661-1837 any time.<BR>
Dance benefit<BR>
<P>

   Proceeds from a special dance performance this week will help provide scholarships for deaf children to attend a special summer camp in St. Augustine. The scholarships will be offered by the Hearing Research Institute, a nonprofit corporation that helps hearing-impaired kids.<P>

   The dance and music performance by the Coral Gables High School Gablettes will be at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the school's auditorium, 450 Bird Rd. Tickets are $5 at the door.<BR>
Rotary anniversary<BR>
<P>

   Almost 200 people attended the recent Golden Anniversary dinner celebrating the 50th year of the Rotary Club of Coral Gables. The club also honored longtime member Cleve Allen. <P>

   Allen, 85, a 62-year member of Rotary, has 55 years of perfect attendance. He was feted by many friends and associates during festivities at the Hyatt Regency.<P>

   Rotarian Cholly Capps of Miami and Tom Herald of Coral Gables were cochairmen for the evening, which included music, a play with Ron Robison of the Gables and Terry Mullin of Davie, and numerous proclamations by Gables commissioners Chip Withers and Jim Barker. <P>

   Allen's wife Carolyn and son John were among those accompanying him to the dinner.
