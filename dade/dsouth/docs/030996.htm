   A proposal to require all apartment complexes in Homestead with 20 or more units to provide proof annually that they have resident managers met with opposition this week from Related Management Corp., which runs eight complexes in the city.<P>

    Three of those, Homestead Village Apartments, 880 and 900 NE 18th Ave.; Polynesian Village Apartments, 50-250 SE Sixth Ave. and Sky Vista Apartments, 1511-1561 NE Eighth St., do not have managers who live on the premises.<P>

   ``If the proposed ordinance passes as is written, these three properties may be in violation,'' said Vernon Lewis, an attorney representing Related Management, told City Council members Monday.<P>

   Now, the three complexes are served by the resident manager at Seagrape Village, 243 NE 12th Ave., which is less than two miles away, Lewis said.<P>

  ``It's been working, what's the issue?'' he said.<P>

  Lewis asked the city to make an exception for companies like Related Management so managers can serve more than one building.<P>

     City attorney Michael Watkins wasn't swayed: ``I think that there ought to be a resident manager period. Pretty soon you don't have any control.''<P>

     Councilwoman Eliza Perry also stood firm. ``I will never support not having an on-site manager,'' she said.<P>

   Lewis told council members there have been problems of excess noise, and drug dealing at the sites, but said resident managers would not necessarily improve things.<P>

  ``The on-site manager isn't going to go out there and try to interrupt the drug transactions. He or she is going to call the police,'' Lewis said.<P>

   Myrle McCullough, who owns a town house next to Riverwalk I Apartments, 330 NE 18th Ave., has complained to the city about the lack of management supervision there.<P>

   ``People shooting guns, partying all night long, horns started blowing in the middle of the night,'' she said.<P>

    Riverwalk I, owned by Related Management, has a resident manager, Lewis said. ``There have been no problems at the three apartment complexes which will be affected by this ordinance.''<P>

   Nevertheless, McCullough said she is pleased with the city's stance.<P>

   ``I think that the large complexes need managers, otherwise the tenants are going to do as they please. They need supervision,'' she said.
