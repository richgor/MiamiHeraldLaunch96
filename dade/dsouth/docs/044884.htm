   A couple of surprises occurred during the swearing in of Pinecrest's first four District Council members Wednesday night at Pinecrest Elementary School:<P>

   <LI> Embattled Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez seized the spotlight, microphone in hand, proclaiming it ``Village of Pinecrest Day'' in Hialeah. <P>

   Pinecrest Mayor Evelyn Greer's law firm represented Martinez in 1991 when he was convicted of extorting close to $1 million in exchange for zoning favors. <P>

   The firm later won an appeal of the decision. In March, the appeal was declared a mistrial.<P>

   <LI> Coral Gables Assistant City Manager Sandy Youkilis made the rounds and introduced himself to commissioners.<P>

   ``He didn't hand me an application, [for Village Manager],'' Pinecrest councilman Barry Blaxberg said. ``But I got a chance to meet him.'' <P>

   So who will be Pinecrest's first village manager? <P>

   ``I haven't received any applications for village manager,'' Greer said. ``Sandy, obviously he's a candidate. I heard [Sam] Kissinger from Key Biscayne and Charles Scurr, who coordinated the Super Bowl for Miami.'' <P>

   Greer said the council will initiate the hiring process for a Village Manager, attorney and clerk at next Tuesday's council meeting. <P>

   Pinecrest's four council members were sworn in Wednesday night amid hoopla, celebrities, food and music.<P>

   Charter Commission member Gary Matzner did the honors, administering oaths as Metro Commissioner Maurice Ferre stood by. <P>

   Shortly after, Ferre spoke of the importance of different Dade County areas forming their own constituencies to bring government closer to the people. <P>

   Then the council got down to business and held its first meeting. <P>

   The council:<P>

   <LI> Passed an ordinance allowing Dade County to recommend zoning applications with final approval from Pinecrest. It requested that any current issue before the Dade County Planning Department that concerns Pinecrest be passed to the council for final approval.<P>

   <LI> Authorized the mayor to shop for the Village's liability insurance.<P>

   <LI> Adopted Robert's Rules of Order. <P>

   <LI> Accepted space in Barnett Bank, 9101 S. Dixie Hwy., to be used as an interim City Hall, at no cost.<P>

   <LI> Gave the mayor the right to oversee the transition of county services and hired Lynn Dannheisser as interim village attorney.<P>

  The council agreed to meet Tuesday at Pinecrest Elementary School, May 14 and 21 at Palmetto Elementary School, and May 28 at Palmetto Middle School. Future meeting sites haven't been determined.<P>

   Last Tuesday's runoff election proved a boon to council candidates who weren't aligned with Greer.<P>

   Of the three candidates backed by Greer who made the runoff, only Cindie Blanck won. Veronica Matzner and Hazel Goldman, who held leads after the primary, both lost in the runoff.<P>

   Barry Blaxberg defeated Matzner, and Robert Hingston beat Goldman. Leslie Bowe easily outdistanced former state senator Richard Renick.<P>

   Greer, however, seemed content with her surrounding cast. <P>

   ``I like my council,'' she said. ``I'm very happy with the council, we had a healthy discussion the first meeting, and I think the council is very representative of our community.''
