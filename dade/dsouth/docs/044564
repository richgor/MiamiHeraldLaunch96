   Samantha Laffoon has just one week of classes left at Ransom Everglades. But she and the other seniors then face two weeks of much different work before they graduate (--) building houses, cleaning parks and caring for injured animals.<ep>
   The Coconut Grove prep school is reinstituting its two-week community service project, the volunteer work once more becoming as important a graduation requirement as classwork.<ep>
   Samantha, 17, said she'll be doing volunteer work for the first time in high school. She believes she will benefit.<ep>
   ``It's almost like we live in a bubble,'' she said. ``Most of us are well-to-do, and that's just not how a lot of the rest of the community is.''<ep>
     Ransom's seniors will finish their final exams Friday. Beginning May 20, they'll volunteer for a week with one of six nonprofit organizations:<ep>
     Wildlife Care Center, 19391 SW 336th St.; Florida AIDS Ride, 1045 Lincoln Rd., Miami Beach; the Coconut Grove branch of the Boys and Girls Club of Miami, 2805 SW 32nd Ave.; Ransom Everglades Summer Camp and Summerbridge, both on campus; or at Dade County Park and Recreation facilities around the county.<ep>
   ``I think the year should end in a positive way, rather than just fade away,'' said Marian Turk, a senior class adviser and English teacher who helped coordinate the project.<ep>
   At the Boys and Girls Club, students will help prepare the center for the 500 kids who are expected for the organization's summer program, said Stephanie Gray, the club's youth coordinator.<ep>
   ``We usually don't have the manpower we need,'' Gray said. ``It's really a great help.''<ep>
   During the project's second week, the 118 members of Ransom's senior class will work together building homes for Habitat for Humanity (--) although they've also carved out time for the senior banquet.<ep>
   ``Soon, we'll all be going our separate ways,'' said Justin Forer. ``It'll be a nice end to a great year.''<ep>
   Students, faculty members and administrators have worked since September to devise a plan to combat the all-too-common ``senioritis.''<ep>
     ``Seniors would watch <m0>Oprah  <m0>and graduate,'' said Tatiana Marina, 17, a senior. ``The idea, now, is to get to do something together as a class.''<ep>
   If successful, the project will likely become a permanent requirement for future graduating classes, said John Cotton, the school's headmaster.<ep>
   Lauren Collins is several steps ahead of her classmates in volunteering. She has worked as a candy striper at Baptist Hospital, tutored students and, until recently, worked five to six hours a week for the Deaf Services Bureau hotline.<ep>
   ``I just love working with people and giving back to the community,'' said Lauren, 18.<ep>
     It's a final lesson Ransom's seniors want to learn.<ql>
