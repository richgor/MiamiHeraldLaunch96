   Richmond Heights students are getting the opportunity to touch up their skills in math, English, or any other subject area they need help.<ep>
   But it means giving up Saturday morning cartoons.<ep>
   The Saturday School program, which began six weeks ago, is offered every Saturday from 9 a.m to noon at Richmond Heights Middle School, 15015 SW 103rd Ave.<ep>
   It will continue through the middle of June. Another session will begin sometime in June, but no dates have been set.<ep>
    About 25 students are taking part in the project, sponsored by the Richmond Heights Neighborhood Crime Watch and Transition. <m1><ep>
<m0>   More are welcome, said Deacon George Baldwin, one of the program's leaders. <ep>
   ``It's amazing,'' he said. ``In just six weeks you can already see an attitude change in the youths.''<ep>
   The program's costs are minimal. The teachers are volunteers and the school donates the space. Money goes toward materials and custodial services.<ep>
   Baldwin said most of the students are between 8 and 11 years old, but the program will accept kids up to 16. <ep>
   But that's the tough part, Baldwin said (--) getting the older kids to give up part of their weekend. He believes, however, that once a student attends, he will be hooked. <ep>
   At first, he said, ``most older kids probably don't want to go. But once they do, they'll stay.''<ql>
