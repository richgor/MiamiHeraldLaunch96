   Denny and Patrick DuLaney, aspiring football stars who have not yet reached high school, are already All-Americans.<P>

   A straight-A student at Kendall's Arvida Middle School, Denny, 14, has been named a first-team All-American Scholar -- one of only 35 eighth-graders in the country to be recognized by Pop Warner Little Scholars, Inc.<P>

   Patrick, 11, a student at Martin Elementary, is one of 35 fifth-graders in the country to receive the same first-team honors.<P>

   ``I tried to nominate my third son, Kevin, but they don't have a program for 8-year-olds,'' said proud mother Carol DuLaney. ``This is real exciting.''<P>

   Denny, Patrick and Kevin all play Pop Warner football through the Kendall Boys and Girls Club, and all made straight A's last year.<P>

   Denny starts both ways for the 120-pound Kolts as a wide receiver and cornerback. Patrick is a starting linebacker for the 80-pound Kolts. Kevin, a running back, plays for the 65-pound Kolts.<P>

   ``If they can only get scholarships for college,'' said Carol DuLaney, ``we've got it made.''<BR>
A hot bat<P>

   Shortstop Jesse Cooper is swinging a hot bat for the Orioles, the second hottest team in the Bantam Division of the Kendall Hammocks Khoury League. Cooper hit a pair of two-run homers in the Orioles' 9-1 playoff victory over the Athletes last week.<P>

   The Orioles were to play the Dodgers Tuesday in a second round playoff game.<P>

   Led by Cooper, who hit .560 with 10 home runs, and pitchers Ruben Torres and Chris Carvajal, who were a combined 14-0, the Orioles swept through the regular season with an 18-1 record.<P>

   ``Our only loss was to the Reds,'' said Coach Ruben Torres, father of the team's star pitcher. ``They finished 19-0. It's going to be tough to go all the way, but we're going to try.''<BR>
New face<P>

   Palmetto Middle School, winner of eight consecutive Dade County golf championships, is going after another county title with a striking new face -- Melanie Schlesinger, only the second girl to make the team in nearly three decades.<P>

   ``She's ranked No. 4 on our team out of six,'' said Coach Bob Murphy, who has been at Palmetto Middle for the past 27 years. ``She's not big or strong but hits the ball well. She has consistency in her swing.''<BR>
A great season<P>

   The finest tee-ball team in the Westchester Optimist League just added another notch to a great season.<P>

   The Marlins, who finished the season 12-0, recently defeated an All-Star team from the Kendall Boys and Girls Club, 34-8.<P>

   The Marlins were led by third baseman Alex Sasieta, infielder William Varas and first baseman Joshua Rodriguez.<BR>
Top pitchers<P>

   The Miami Mini-Canes, defending state softball champions, enter the Lake Lytal Tournament in West Palm Beach May 18 with two of the top 10-year-old pitchers in Dade -- Michelle Diaz and Ashley Ore.<P>

   Ore, 15-5 this season, is following in the steps of older sister Tiffany, a pitching star for the Mini-Canes' 14-and-under team.<P>

   Diaz, 18-10 this season, also is following an older sibling, Jennifer, a star pitcher for the Mini-Canes' 12-and-under team.<P>
