<m0>   The Sylvia Orkin Holocaust Impact Theatre is starting another season of educating and performing for South Florida Schools, churches and synagogues.<ep>
   The troupe, which consists of 13 members from area high schools, was born last year as a venue to explore the dehumanization that resulted during the Holocaust, said <m0>Sharon Socherman, <m0>the group's education director. <ep>
   This year the troupe is exploring all aspects of prejudice and discrimination and portions of the performance includes skits on anti-Semitism, racism, child abuse and homelessness.<ep>
   Along with Socherman of Kendall and artistic director <m0>Kate Denson <m0>of South Miami, the teens write, produce, stage and direct their own scenes, Socherman said. Performances last 45 minutes and are followed by question-and-answer sessions.<ep>
   The next performance is at 8:15 p.m. Monday at Temple Samu-El Or Olom, 9353 SW 152nd Ave. It is free.<ql>
<m0>Pleasant surprise<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  <m0>Members of the Coral Gables Junior Woman's Club recently got an added lift while rehearsing for this year's Cabaret fund-raiser.<ep>
   They received a $12,000 grant from the Dr. John T. Macdonald foundation. The grant, written to help support the club's May Van Sickle Free Children's Dental Clinic, was almost twice the amount requested, said club Vice President <m0>Betsy Britton <m0>of Kendall.<ep>
   Although the grant helps keep the clinic's doors open, club members are still counting on the proceeds from Cabaret to supply the funding the club needs to provide more than $110,000 annually in free dental care for needy children.<ep>
   The 58th annual Cabaret, ``Rockin' to the Rhythm,'' will be at 8:15 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 2 p.m. May 19 at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts, 174 E. Flagler St. Tickets range from $15 to $35 and group rates are available. Call 255-9785 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., or 253-5038, or Ticketmaster 358-5885, both any time. Limited number of tickets available at door.<ql>
