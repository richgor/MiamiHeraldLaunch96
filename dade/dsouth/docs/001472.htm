<H2>Feeding stray cats in park isn't heroic; why not take them into your homes?</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
     Editor:<P>

In rebuttal to three letters to the editor published April 28 about several ladies feeding cats illegally in A.D. Barnes Park in Miami.<P>

     First, Susan Julevich calls ladies heroes when they feed abandoned cats in the park a few feet from a park sign that reads ``Don't Feed Animals.'' When I confronted one woman about putting out fly-attracting fishy cat food on the ground she replied, ``I don't believe in park regulations. I make my own!'' As for my observing cats eating wild insect-eating birds, that was months before I was aware of cats being illegally fed. I was told that cats were being fed by senior women. The park employee was unhappy about the feeding twice a day. Apparently Barnes Park employees fear confronting these law-breaking ladies. One park employee and I vigorously protested to a hero lady illegally feeding the cats very close to the ``Don't Feed'' sign. But to no avail. This was about three weeks ago. I picked up the cat food a total of four times during that first week of discovery; since then I have stopped. My current activity is to attempt to convince high-level park administrators to stop the illegal feeding practice but without success.<P>

   Cats are efficient predators. Even when fed it is their nature to prey upon small animals and birds. Temporarily stopping feeding while trapping these cats will not cause starvation. I understand the current plan is to spay and neuter these animals. Wonderful! But returning these cats to the park is intolerable. Are our public parks to become private zoos at taxpayers' expense to a few cat lovers?<P>

   Julevich praises these ladies for breaking park regulations. As an R.N., do you follow hospital regulations? Would you substitute your own medication for a patient because you didn't agree with the doctor's? I think not. And my cranium doesn't have a geranium in it. I'm a World War II veteran giving over three years to my country.<P>

   Now, L. Krause, you say Sylvia Unzueta is to be praised for refusing to hurt animals. Do you know as an employee of the parks system, it is her duty to enforce all park regulations: page 26, rule 22, Dade County parks handbook. Is she doing her duty by letting these ladies illegally feed these cats these past two years? What is she doing about the deaths of hundreds of birds and other small animals by run-wild domestic cats? Scientists tell us that without wild birds to control insect pests, man could not survive on this planet. Could humans survive without cats in the world? These free-roaming cats are hosts to mites and fleas, carry diseases, and are filthy. Who bathes them?<P>

  Did the democracies fail to invade Hitler's fortress Europe because of a fear of soldiers getting hurt? How sad that so many thousands of fine men lost their lives that each soldier made his own rules for the great success we had against Hitler's tyranny? These men are the real true heroes.<P>

   Jacqueline Bernier, I'm not bitter about the abandoned cats in Barnes Park, I'm just disgusted with the Dade County Parks administrators for not correcting the shameful practice of allowing cat feeding in public parks. They are well paid by us taxpayers to do their jobs.<P>

   Now to all persons who truly care about these abandoned cats, I recommend trapping these cats and taking several each into your homes to give them loving care.<P>

   Good for you, L. Krause, for keeping four cats in your home, thus keeping them out of park woods. May other cat lovers follow.<P>

   Remember, ``Evil can exist in society when good men do nothing.''<BR>

<H2>Dark Ages are over; cats deserve love, care</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
Editor:<P>

During the Dark Ages cats were blamed for almost everything: for being a product of Satan, for bad harvests, for sorcery, for being the causes of diseases.<P>

   Cats were tried, executed, burned alive. However, cats saved the human populations -- and probably Western civilizations -- by killing the rats that were the real transmitters of the Black Death. <P>

   One would think that cat-blamers are something of the past. But then we get a biology teacher, who is supposed to teach kindness and compassion to the animal kingdom, saying that stray cats should be left to starve. [Feeding Frenzy: Cat lovers, bird watcher spar over strays, April 21].<P>

   Unfortunately, there are many people who hate cats, who want them starving to death.<P>

   They should know that cats are loving and sweet animals, that once you love them they will love you forever. The solution to the cats overpopulation is to spay and neuter them and not to dump kittens in every park. Cats are mammals and carnivorous; they can't survive eating grass and insects.<P>

     So please, spay or neuter your cats. And take the unwanted kittens to Pet Rescue, Adopt-a-Pet, Cat Network or a similar agency. We must show the world that the Dark Ages are gone.<BR>
