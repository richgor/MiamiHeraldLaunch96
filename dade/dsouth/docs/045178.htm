   South Dade residents again are uniting to plead for a regional park at the former Homestead Air Force Base.<P>

   ``It's just a vicious, stupid battle all the time, and there's no need for it,'' said Barbara Dodson, a board member of the Princeton/Naranja Community Council.<P>

   Dodson and many of her neighbors are planning to go to the Metro Commission meeting Tuesday to fight a resolution, proposed by Commissioner James Burke, that seeks to remove 200 acres previously designated for the park from the application transferring the base from the Federal Aviation Administration to Metro-Dade County.<P>

   ``My preference is to create a development that focuses on giving jobs to people rather than create a play, recreational area,'' Burke said. ``We don't have money for the parks that we have now. I don't know where we're going to find money for another park.''<P>

  Some residents said the issue is not just the park, but how the commission operates.<P>

   ``Why would a commissioner from District 2 take the lead on something in Districts 8 and 9,'' asked Kim Striker, president of the Princeton/Naranja Community Council. ``He goes against the wishes of the community and commission as a whole because they're already on it.''<P>

   Burke said his goal is not to eliminate the park, but to get the FAA to consider the financial feasibility of the base redevelopment project with a park and without it.<P>

   ``I want to know what they say,'' he said. ``That's why I want to present alternatives.''<P>

    The designated park area is at the northern end of the old base on land that was a residential neighborhood and a golf course before Hurricane Andrew.<P>

    The rest of the base will be turned into a civilian airport with retail shops, offices and industrial parks developed by Homestead Air Base Developers Inc.<P>

    The park was added to the project after commissioners in December required the developers to include it.<P>

    The commission approved the park again last month after homeowners, environmentalists and schoolchildren came out in force at a meeting on the base's development.<P>

   ``It's rather frustrating that the public continually has to go down to force the commission to support the decision that they made on two occasions,'' said John Sykes of the South Dade Community Council, an umbrella group for 30 homeowner associations in South Dade.<P>

   Rick Busch of the Dade County Aviation Department is working to complete the documents to be sent to the FAA and said his agency sees both sides. <P>

   The aviation department has completed a study that showed the county would recover its investment in the project if the park were included, but more money would be made without the park, Busch said.<P>

   ``There's a social value versus an economic value. But I'm not sure you can put those two side by side,'' he said.
