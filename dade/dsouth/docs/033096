   Homestead residents are invited Monday to discuss the city's Evaluation and Appraisal Report of the city's comprehensive land use plan and suggest adjustments.<ep>
   A workshop will be held from 5 to 7 p.m. in the city manager's conference room.<ep>
   The report, required every five years by the state to ensure cities are following their land use plans, was funded by a $20,000 state grant. <ep>
     ``This is a measuring stick on how we're doing on our successes and our failures,'' said Elly McKuen, supervisor of community development and planning services.<ep>
   The objectives of Homestead's comprehensive plan include enhancing economic growth, redeveloping the downtown business district, creating affordable housing and increasing home-ownership.<ep>
    Since Homestead's plan was updated after Hurricane Andrew and adopted only last August, few changes are needed, McKuen said.<ep>
   Two significant changes have occurred since then: annexation of 1,622 acres and adoption of the city's Historic Preservation survey.<ep>
   Henry Iler, a planning consultant for James Duncan Associates who is working with Homestead, said the historic survey identified 177 sites built before 1940.<ep>
   ``It's essentially going to lay some guidelines that the city will follow in trying to preserve historic sites,'' Iler said.<ep>
   Planning ahead for the city's land use has its challenges, McKuen said, including helping the residents understand how it benefits everyone.<ep>
   ``Because the comprehensive plan is so new, the big challenge is to educate how the comprehensive plan will work with the community to develop it over the next five to 10 years,'' McKuen said.<ql>
