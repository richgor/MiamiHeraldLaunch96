<m0>   The Coconut Grove Chamber of Commerce has been awarded a $6,000 grant by the Dade Community Foundation to improve two existing youth programs and create a new one for Coconut Grove and Coral Gables kids.<ep>
   The programs are administered with the help of the Boys and Girls Club of Miami.<ep>
   ``One of the things the chamber tries to do is reach out to various sectors of the community,'' said Allen Sweeny, chamber president. ``Through the generosity of the Dade Community Foundation, we now have the financial resources to build bridges among the youth in our area.''<ep>
   Established in 1967, the foundation administers funds set up by individuals, families, businesses and other organizations to support local, nonprofit groups through grants and technical assistance.<ep>
   Programs <m1> <m0>for which the chamber will use the money are:<ep>
   (box) A student mentoring and counseling program that pairs 45 Coral Gables high school students with 45 ``high risk'' elementary school students in Coconut Grove.<ep>
  (box) The neighborhood track club and tutorial program that will provide financial support for the Curry/Grice Track Club. The club was initiated by parents in Coconut Grove. The program will also provide after-school tutoring for club members at the Gibson Center in Coconut Grove.<ep>
   The new program will provide clinics led by Coral Gables High School students and coaches of football, basketball, baseball and cheerleading for youngsters who participate in the Boys and Girls Club of Miami's athletic programs in Armbrister Park in Coconut Grove.<ep>
    Sweeny said the idea to apply for the grant came from chamber board member and Coconut Grove Elementary School principal Von Beebe.<ep>
   ``I've always cared about children growing up and becoming good citizens,'' Beebe said. ``As a school principal, I feel strongly that the whole community should be used as a classroom.''<ep>
   Sweeny said many programs involve children from both areas because schools such as Ponce de Leon Middle School and <m1> <m0>George Washington Carver Middle School feed students into Coral Gables Senior High School.<ep>
   ``There has been friction as children leave and go into the Coral Gables High School,'' Sweeny said. ``The programs are designed to facilitate and orientate those children who are going to make the transition.''<ep>
