<m0>     The South Miami Police Department will have an open house in honor of Police Appreciation Week from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday at 6130 Sunset Dr.<ep>
   The public is invited to tour the police facility. Tours will begin hourly. There will be displays featuring drug abuse exhibits, weapons used by criminals and patches collected from other police departments.<ep>
   ``We try to do this every year in conjunction with Police Appreciation Week,'' said Sgt. Dan Salerno, the department's services division commander. ``It's a way to let people see the police department and get to know their police department.''<ql>
