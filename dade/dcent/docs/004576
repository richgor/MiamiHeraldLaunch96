<m0>   The south of France? Spain?<ep>
   No, this scene actually plays out in Coral Gables. Not very often, mind you, but on occasion.<ep>
     Two years after the city passed a law allowing restaurants to set up tables and chairs outside, little more than a handful do: Doc Dammers Saloon, Restaurant St. Michel, Cafe on the Mile, Bocaditos on Ponce de Leon Boulevard and Il Provencale.<ep>
   But other food-related businesses (--) coffee houses, bakeries and ice cream shops for example (--) want in on the picturesque practice.<ep>
   The city's economic development board recommended to city commissioners last month that they adjust the law to allow sidewalk cafes for those uses. The planning department is currently working on the revision.<ep>
   Madeleine Low, owner of Biga Bakery on Alcazar Avenue, hopes the City Commission accepts it.<ep>
   ``It is really a response to our customers' requests,'' Low said. ``We do a very popular sandwich business. We've built up a very nice clientele and they have places to sit inside, but they're always asking us to be able to sit outside under an umbrella.''<ep>
   One afternoon, two customers moved a table outside. ``And I felt terrible but I went over and said, `You know, we really don't have permission to do this,' and I had to ask them to go inside.<ep>
   The Gables, she added, is perfect for sidewalk dining.<ep>
   Diane Brandt, chairwoman of the Gables Chamber of Commerce's Retail Council, says sidewalk cafes draw more shoppers.<ep>
   ``One of the ways that you invite and revitalize street life, meaning pedestrian traffic, both daytime and nighttime, is through scene activity,'' Brandt said. <m1><ep>
<m0>  ``I should be allowed to sit out and have a cup of coffee and a brioche like they do in the rest of the United States and Europe,'' Brandt said. ``It happens everywhere. Why not in the Gables?''<ep>
   Vice Mayor Dorothy Thomson can think why not: South Beach. She was there on a recent Sunday and was not enthused with the booming sidewalk business.<ep>
   ``A pedestrian has to walk sideways on a sliver of the sidewalk or walk on the street,'' Thomson said. ``I don't want to see that happen in Coral Gables.''<ep>
   She is not completely opposed.<ep>
   ``I just think we need to be careful,'' she said.<ep>
