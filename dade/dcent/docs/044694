<m0>   South Miami is getting out of the recycling business.<ep>
   The city recently signed an agreement with Metro-Dade to provide recycling service for residents. The new program will begin pickup June 5, replacing the city's own program.<ep>
   ``We believe this will be an improvement,'' said Diana Morris, assistant to the city manager. ``The county recycle program allows for the recycling of a larger variety of material. The program will also be more cost-efficient for the citizens of the city.''<ep>
   The current collection is limited to newspaper, plastics, aluminum cans, telephone books and glass bottles. With the expanded program, collection will include ferrous cans, some specified containers, household batteries, corrugated cardboard and mixed wastepaper.<ep>
   Browning-Ferris Industries Community Recycling, the company Dade County contracts to provide the service, will deliver new recycling bins throughout the city on June 1. Information packets detailing the new program and how residents should separate recyclables will also be provided.<ep>
   Morris said residents should place their old containers in front of their house by 7 a.m. June 1 to be picked up when the two new 18 gallon bins are delivered. She said a letter has been mailed to each home detailing the date of delivery of the bins and the new service schedule.<ep>
   For more information, call 633-3100 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays.<ql>
