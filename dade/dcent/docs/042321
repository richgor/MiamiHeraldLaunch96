   Chianti, <m0>Caffe(acu) saicaf classico<m0>, and red, white and green balloon centerpieces adorned the tables. Postcards from Venice and Pisa and strings of lira coins draped the lectern. In the background, Luciano Pavarotti sang <m0>O Sol E Mio.<m0><ep>
   Dressed in a black vest, long-sleeved white shirt and a black bow tie, Marcos Camji, 11, opens small bottles of S. Pelligrino mineral water and serves his classmates. He has a white linen napkin draped on his left arm just like an experienced Italian waiter.<ep>
   Marcos and 17 of his fifth-grade classmates at Highpoint Academy were re-enacting an Italian feast dinner. They were teaching the rest of the school the proper way of eating and setting a table. They gave mini-speeches on the types of food Italians indulge in.<ep>
   Highpoint, which has 350 students from toddlers to eighth grade, just wrapped up a week of etiquette. The kids learned about the correct manner of answering a phone, eating pasta and sushi, greeting visitors in a wedding line and experiencing European, Asian and American cultures.<ep>
   Each grade from first through eighth selected a culture: third-graders celebrated Christmas in Spain with castanets, sixth-graders brought sushi for their classmates, second-graders dressed up as 17th Century English people drinking tea, and seventh-graders emphasized the social graces of fine dining in a French restaurant.<ep>
   ``We're concerned the children today are growing up without concepts of basic etiquette,'' said Alicia Casanova, principal of Highpoint Academy, 12101 SW 34th St. ``We wanted them to know about manners and about different cultures.''<ep>
   ``It's great,'' said Mery Garcia, 39, and mother of a fifth-grader. ``Kids need this. We can only do so much at home. Manners need to be emphasized at school.''<ep>
   The kids had fun (--) and learned in the process.<ep>
   ``I learned not to butter bread in mid-air and how not to cut spaghetti,'' said Garcia's 10-year-old son, Jorge, who was acting as a waiter.<ep>
   ``You're supposed to have proper manners when you go out and use the proper utensils,'' said fifth-grader Sadaria Hughes, 11. ``Before, I would just cut spaghetti up and never used the spoon to hold it down.''<ep>
   Besides their own presentation, the fifth-graders got to see all those organized by the rest of the student body.<ep>
   ``All these presentations are interesting,'' said Steven Sanchez, 11. ``They talk about etiquette in all types of countries and how they may vary, like using chopsticks with Asian food to the way we were eating our spaghetti.''<ep>
   Students also learned what foods to avoid in the future.<ep>
   Sadaria Hughes, 11, took a sip of carbonated mineral water and said, ``It tastes disgusting.'' <ep>
   Carlos Perez, 11, said, ``Asians eat cool food (--) sushi. I didn't like it. It's raw.''<ep>
   After their presentation, the students got to eat and practiced what they preached. Well, sort of.<ep>
   Eliza Sorzano, 11, tried to eat a plateful of fettuccini Alfredo by spooling the fettuccini onto the fork while holding on to the spoon. She soon gave up and began to cut the pasta.<ep>
   She said: ``You can't eat fettuccini like you eat spaghetti. It was good for spaghetti, but this isn't spaghetti.''<ql>
