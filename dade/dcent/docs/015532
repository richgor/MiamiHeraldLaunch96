<m0>   At times Monday, Sweetwater Council President Cecilia Holtz Alonso sounded like the end of one of those car commercials when the announcer runs all the words together in a cacophony of disclaimers: tagandtitlenotincludedetcetera.<ep>
   But she steered the council through an entire agenda (--) something it hadn't finished in the past two meetings.<ep>
   The most controversial item, a discussion of flooding on Southwest Seventh Street, was scheduled for a special meeting next Monday after council members spent almost an hour talking with two engineers who had studied plans to repair the street.<ep>
   It also helped that Mayor Gloria Bango had asked Holtz Alonso last week to keep things moving along.<ep>
   ``City business cannot stop,'' Bango said.<ep>
   Just before the 11:30 p.m. deadline, council members volunteered to defer discussions about their own personal projects or ideas to get the meeting finished. At 11:30 p.m. (--) city law prohibits City Council meetings from going on past that time (--) Councilman Jose Diaz moved to extend the meeting 15 minutes.<ep>
   It wasn't necessary. The council adjourned at 11:35 p.m.<ql>
