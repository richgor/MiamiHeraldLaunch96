<m0>   A big jump in the number of burglaries in the Roads (--) from 24 in 1994 to 144 in 1995 (--) has both residents and police sharing the same concern.<ep>
   The residents' major complaint: not enough police presence.<ep>
   ``I agree with them,'' Miami police Lt. Manny Orosa said recently.<ep>
   Orosa is neighborhood resource commander for the Coral Way Net Office, which serves not only the Roads but also Brickell, Virginia Key, Coral Gate, Shenandoah and the Douglas Park area with only four officers.<ep>
   ``I'm trying to furnish visibility with motorcycle squads and a police officer riding a bike,'' Orosa said. ``I'm trying to help as best as I can.''<ep>
  Some relief may be coming.<ep>
   Orosa, whose officers sometimes are called out of the Roads to help in Little Havana and Coconut Grove, said the city is working on revamping its net offices, which may mean additional officers for each station. The program also would keep officers in a specific area instead of having them answer calls elsewhere, Orosa said.<ep>
   Joe Wilkins, president of Miami Roads Neighborhood Civic Association, is encouraged, but said residents also need to help themselves and get involved in their community. <ep>
   ``We have a Citizens on Patrol program with over 50 volunteers and we need more,'' he said. ``We are not just sitting back and demanding more police service.''<ep>
   The residents agree on one thing: Though statistics Orosa provided also showed the number of thefts down slightly from 256 in 1994 to 237 last year, they are tired of crime.<ep>
   For Susan Hopper, a four-year resident of the Roads, it's becoming unbearable.<ep>
   ``Crime has always been bad, but this year it has been outrageous,'' Hopper said. ``There is nobody you can talk to that hasn't been robbed. My neighbor has to lock her door before she crosses the street to visit me.''<ql>
