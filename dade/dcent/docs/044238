<m0>   Some Cutler Ridge Mall merchants hope the merger between mall operator DeBartolo Realty Corp. and Simon Property Group will bring in more shoppers.<ep>
   The mall, which has about 100 stores, has at least 15 visible empty store or restaurant fronts with two more stores going out of business. Several merchants say more should be done to attract customers and help boost existing shops.<ep>
   ``When you look at the lack of advertisement, the lack of aggressive marketing and their ineptitude to fill up the empty square footage in the mall,'' said Nick Lomangino, manager at Shoe World which is closing, ``it's not too hard to figure out.''<ep>
   Said Marilyn Brown, manager of Today's Woman, which also is closing: ``Our volume was not enough to keep the store open.''<ep>
   Marie Cartwright, spokeswoman for DeBartolo Properties Management, said the merger alone will not have much effect on operations.<ep>
   But changes are coming.<ep>
   Gary Moss, DeBartolo regional manager for Florida, said the company will soon begin a new advertising campaign to promote the mall through direct mail, billboards, and special mall events.<ep>
   ``We're working very diligently to fill those vacancies,'' he said. ``You're going to see increased visibility in the media.''<ep>
   The campaign will target the area's new demographics, which have changed significantly since the mall was devastated by Hurricane Andrew.<ep>
   Because of the storm, both the shopping center and the community have had to start from scratch, Moss said. The population concentration is now north of the mall.<ep>
   ``The market to the south of us is considerably smaller than it was before the Homestead Air Force Base and the other business entities closed as a result of Hurricane Andrew,'' Moss said.<ep>
   Nevertheless, he added, statistics show the mall is generally doing well.<ep>
   ``Our sales trend there overall has been positive,'' he said.<ep>
   The mall is more than 85 percent leased, which is typical in today's market, Moss said.<ep>
   ``We're pleased with the overall performance of the growth as the area comes back.''<ql>
