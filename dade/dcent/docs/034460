<m0>   In September, voters in Sweetwater will have more to say about how their city government is run.<ep>
   The City Council agreed Monday to put three charter changes on the ballot that will determine:<ep>
   (box) How council vacancies are filled.<ep>
   (box) If a city employee who is fired can appeal to the City Council.<ep>
   (box) If council members be elected by group seats.<ep>
   All are amendments to the city charter and must be approved by a majority of voters.<ep>
   Councilwoman Prisca Barreto moved to change how council vacancies are filled. Currently, if a council member leaves before a term expires, the council must chose someone from the pool of unsuccessful candidates in the last election to serve out the term.<ep>
   Barreto's proposal would automatically grant the seat to the unsuccessful candidate who had the next highest number of total votes.<ep>
   ``This way, the voters of Sweetwater will have a direct effect on who becomes a council member,'' Barreto said.<ep>
   Councilman Manuel Duasso was the only no vote.<ep>
   Councilman Manuel L. Maron~o presented the change to let employees appeal their terminations to the council.<ep>
   ``I bring this up so that employees won't feel their position has anything to do with politics,'' Maron~o said. ``So they are not terminated due to politics and so they know we value them for their work.''<ep>
   Mayor Gloria Bango, who has the authority to fire anyone at will, did not recommend the change. She said employees already approach council members about their bosses or co-workers in an effort to get their sympathy.<ep>
   ``This will be opening it up to more problems,'' Bango said. <m1><ep>
<m0>   If passed, the amendment would allow the City Council to overrule any termination by the mayor as long as five of the seven members agree.<ep>
   Council President Cecilia Holtz Alonso and Councilman Jesus Mesa voted no.<ep>
   Councilman Jose Diaz suggested the group elections amendment.<ep>
   Currently, council members run at large and the top vote-getters are elected. Diaz's proposal would require candidates to file for a particular group and run against only those in the same group. Those running unopposed would automatically be elected.<ep>
   That resolution passed 4-3 with Holtz Alonso, Duasso and Mesa voting no.<ql>
