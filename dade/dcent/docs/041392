   A developer who wants to build houses on 20 acres at the future intersection of Coral Way and Southwest 149th Avenue was rebuffed last week by the Metro Commission.<ep>
   The commission split evenly over a zoning application by Marpi Corp. The tie vote means the application will be heard again, possibly May 23.<ep>
   Marpi is seeking permission to build 75 single-family homes, on lots measuring 50 by 100 feet and 60 by 100 feet, in an area known as the Bird Drive Basin. Full-size lots measure 75 by 100 feet.<ep>
   Metro staff recommended approval, but the application drew opposition from area residents and four commissioners: Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, Katy Sorenson, Dennis Moss and Betty Ferguson.<ep>
   Diaz de la Portilla said he feared approval would set a precedent in the neighborhood. Commissioners Alex Penelas, Maurice Ferre, Javier Souto and Bruce Kaplan voted to approve the application.<ep>
   The principals of Marpi include Carlos Martinez of Caribe Construction and Sergio Pino, former president of the Latin Builders Association.<ep>
   Martinez and Pino are partners in Caribe Lakes, a nearby development of 454 homes on 80 acres at Bird Road and Southwest 154th Avenue.<ep>
   The Metro Commission approved zoning for that project in 1994. Diaz de la Portilla and Ferguson voted against.<ep>
   To win approval for the current application, Marpi has offered to donate up to $40,000 to buy a security system for Zora Neale Hurston Elementary.<ql>
