   A Coral Gables fire captain has sued the city claiming his workplace is a hostile environment and that he has been discriminated against because he is Hispanic.<P>

   The lawyers for Capt. Pablo Gonzalez, who include Osvaldo Soto, chairman of the Spanish American League Against Discrimination, say the Fire Department's top officials systematically have passed their client up for promotions.<P>

   ``Because he's Hispanic, he has been persecuted and discriminated against for many years,'' Soto said.<P>

   Co-counsel Lawrence McGuinness said the Gables Fire Department has a ``Hispanic ceiling'' that prevents Hispanic officers from moving up the Fire Department ladder past a certain point.<P>

   ``It is an insiders' club,'' McGuinness said. ``If you're in power, the natural inclination is to have those that are like you around you in power, and those that are not like you on the outside.<P>

   ``This is not a case of personality. This is a case where someone who obviously has the qualifications has been systematically passed over for promotions,'' McGuinness said.<BR>
Fire Chief Richard Cook said Gonzalez has not been discriminated against.<P>

   ``Everyone here is treated the same. There is no difference,'' Cook said.<P>

   Gonzalez cannot talk about his suit because his contract with the city forbids it.<P>

   In March 1995, Gonzalez filed a discrimination charge against the city with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. On March 29 this year, the EEOC ruled he could take the city to court. Less than two weeks later, Gonzalez was given a 36-hour suspension.<P>

   The disciplinary action goes back to January when Gonzalez's supervisors say he took an unauthorized leave. His battalion chief recommended a written warning. Cook, then division chief, recommended a 36-hour suspension, which was approved April 10.<P>

   That incident is one listed in the lawsuit to prove the discrimination charge. Gonzalez's lawyers claim similar infractions by non-Hispanics have resulted in lesser disciplinary measures.<P>

   Chief Cook said there is no disciplinary standard.<P>

   ``Things like that always depend on a case-by-case basis,'' Cook said Friday. <P>

   ``Nothing like this particular case has arisen that I've seen. There are certain procedures you go through to be granted leave, and they weren't followed in this particular case. We've never had a similar infraction.''<P>

   Soto claims the Fire Department more than any other city department consistently belittles Hispanics and stops them from moving up.<P>

   ``There is a select group of individuals over there who have made it very difficult for [Gonzalez] and other officers to move up,'' he said.<P>

   The city's affirmative action statistics show significant growth in the number of Hispanic employees since 1979, but Soto said most of those Hispanics are stuck in lower level positions.<P>

   City Manager Jack Eads said the city does not discriminate, but said he also is prohibited from commenting on pending litigation.<P>

     Mayor Raul Valdes-Fauli, who has criticized the Fire Department in the past for unfair testing practices with Hispanic applicants, said he does not know the particulars of Gonzalez's complaints.<P>

   ``Anything is possible,'' he said. ``I will look into it.''
