   Dr. Jean Perdue treated hundreds of patients at her Miami Beach office. But now she has refined her practice to reading, writing and arithmetic.<ep>
     Perdue, 93, works with elementary students through Senior Mentors for Creative Students Program. <ep>
   ``One great gift the older person can give to the community is helping a child to read and write,'' said Perdue, who is also a board member of the Dade chapter of the Alliance for the Aging. ``There isn't enough money and teachers, so that's where we come in.<ep>
     ``A child who gets to the third and fourth grade and can't read or write, they're in serious trouble.''<ep>
    Perdue and five other volunteers (--) Evelyn Best, Beverly Hammel, Thomas Reed, and Hy and Joan Rosner (--) will be honored for their work Thursday at the Radisson Mart Hotel.<ep>
   The Senior Mentor for Creative Students Program started 10 years ago as an offspring of the Adopt a Grandparent program, in which senior citizens are paired with young students. Today, nearly 3,200 senior citizens mentor 5,000 Dade students.<ep>
   ``You think there's an age generation gap, but when you see them together, it's almost an instant bonding,'' said Ramona Frischman, supervisor of intergenerational programs for Dade schools.<ep>
    ``They really find they have a lot in common. They're both discriminated against because of age. Either they are too old, or too young.''<ep>
   Students at Centennial Middle found a lot in common with Thomas Reed, 59, a retired New York City health administrator.<ep>
    Reed, who studied music at Indiana University and a member of the Florida International University Master Choral and the Civic Choral of Greater Miami, took his voice skills to Centennial.<ep>
     ``There was a group of kids who wanted to start a choir, but they didn't have an instructor,'' Reed said.<ep>
     In January, Reed began giving voice lessons and introducing the students to a variety of music, including spirituals and folk songs. Since then, the Centennial choir has competed in local and state events.<ep>
   Hy and Joan Rosner, former New York educators, have spent the past 12 years traveling between Miami and New Mexico, sharing a save-the-environment message with children in both places.<ep>
   In Dade, the couple has organized overnight nature trips for elementary school students, written a book about the history of Miami's environment, and brought students face-to-face with scientists to study pollution.<ep>
   ``When you retire, that doesn't mean you have left your brain behind,'' said Hy Rosner. ``We believe in trying to make the places we stay better than how we found it when we got there.''<ep>
   Retired Dade teacher Beverly Hammel, 69, was so inspired by the mentor program at M.A. Milam Elementary in Hialeah that she rounded up a dozen residents at nearby Epworth Village (--) former teachers, business owners and an attorney (--) to also help.<ep>
     ``I said, `Let me get these people and get them over to school,' '' Hammel said.<ep>
     Evelyn Best, 71, is being honored mentoring and recruiting parishioners from her church to help at Jackson High.<ql>
