<m0>   Patty Newman always dreamed of being a nurse (--) and for 42 years she has kept that dream alive.<ep>
   Newman, who has worked at South Miami Hospital for 33 years, was honored Tuesday as the hospital's longest-term employee. She was surrounded by co-workers in the hospital's cafeteria when the presentation was announced.<ep>
   ``The people here are so magnificent,'' she said. ``This is why I have stayed so long.''<ep>
   Dr. Harry Schrier, who has worked with Newman for 15 years, considers her a part of his extended family.<ep>
   ``She's a wonderful lady and a very special friend,'' Schrier said. ``She's the absolute paragon of dedication and professionalism with a heart of gold.''<ep>
   Newman, who received a diploma in nursing from St. Luke's Hospital in New York in 1954, began nursing at a time when laser surgery didn't exist, outpatient centers were unheard of and surgical gloves had to be washed and powdered by the doctors and nurses.<ep>
   ``[Medicine] has changed tremendously,'' Newman said. ``There is so much technology that it is unbelievable.''<ep>
   After graduating, Newman worked for the Air Force in New Mexico as a nurse in the surgery department, then went to obstetrics. She moved to South Florida in 1962.<ep>
   When she began working at South Miami, she was a staff nurse in the operating room. She then became head nurse in the same department in 1976 and eventually became the coordinator for the operating room in 1981.<ep>
   As a coordinator, Newman oversees the daily running of the operating room.<ep>
   Newman, a Miami Beach resident, decided to enter the field of nursing because she ``always wanted to help people.''<ep>
   Although Newman has undergone numerous operations herself, she has not let it slow her down. Her positive attitude is evident in her work and personal life.<ep>
   ``Life is what you make of it,'' Newman said. ``If you act old, you are going to wither away. I've had seven angioplasties, but that doesn't stop me. I don't let anything stop me.''<ep>
   When she is not busy scheduling surgeries or comforting patients, she spends her spare time traveling, playing bridge and even engaging in a popular Miami Beach sport (--) Rollerblading.<ep>
   She began Rollerblading along Ocean Drive a few years ago after two other nurses who were visiting from another hospital encouraged her to try the sport.<ep>
   Between her traveling and Rollerblading, Newman also finds the time to indulge in her favorite pastime (--) football.<ep>
   ``I'm a diehard Dolphin fan,'' Newman said. ``I don't miss a game.''<ep>
   Although Newman has contemplated retiring, she said she wouldn't know what to do with herself if she did.<ep>
   ``When I reached 60 I thought I would retire, but I think I still have a lot to contribute,'' Newman said. ``As long as my health allows, I'll be at the hospital.''<ql>
