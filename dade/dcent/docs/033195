<m0>   You don't have to travel far outside the urban reaches of South Florida to enjoy camping with your family. Stay put and experience a wide range of outdoor life.<ep>
   Public parks in Dade, Broward and the Everglades offer camping opportunities from primitive to pampering.<ep>
 There are campgrounds that require you to bring everything with you (--) and then pack out all your trash. Others will furnish you with tents, coolers and even a boat.<ep>
   South Florida may not have mountains, canyons and rain forests. But one thing nearly all campgrounds have plenty of is water.<ep>
   You and your family will be kept very busy fishing, swimming, water sliding, canoeing, paddleboating and cable water skiing, so that you'll never miss those faraway climbs up steep Rockies looking for glaciers.<ep>
   For a list of South Florida's premier public campgrounds and what they offer, <m0>see pages 20-21.<m0><ql>
