<m0>   Drivers using Sunset Drive for about five blocks just east and west of Southwest 127th Avenue will be inconvenienced for about another week as Florida Power & Light relocates underground conduits. <ep>
   The eastbound lanes on Sunset have been barricaded, and traffic has been forced onto the westbound lanes, creating one-lane roads in each direction. <ep>
   Also, travelers on 127th Avenue between Kendall and Sunset drives will continue to travel in one lane in each direction, sometimes along a winding dirt road, as Dade County Public Works widens the road.<ep>
   Modesto Nunez, assistant director of public works construction and maintenance, said the $4.3 million project will widen 127th Avenue to two lanes in each direction. <ep>
   The project, which began in October 1995, is expected to be completed by next spring. <ep>
