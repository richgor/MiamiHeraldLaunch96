<m0>   South Miami is getting out of the recycling business.<ep>
   The city recently signed an agreement with Metro-Dade to provide recycling service for residents. The new program will begin pickup June 5, replacing the city's own program.<ep>
   ``We believe this will be an improvement,'' said Diana Morris, assistant to the city manager. ``The county recycle program allows for the recycling of a larger variety of material. The program will also be more cost-efficient for the citizens of the city.''<ep>
   The current collection is limited to newspaper, plastics, aluminum cans, telephone books and glass bottles. With the expanded program, collection will include ferrous cans, some specified containers, household batteries, corrugated cardboard and mixed wastepaper.<ep>
   Browning-Ferris Industries Community Recycling, the company Dade County contracts to provide the service, will deliver new recycling bins throughout the city on June 1. Information packets detailing the new program and how residents should separate recyclables will also be provided.<ep>
   Morris said residents should place their old containers in front of their house by 7 a.m. June 1 to be picked up when the two new 18 gallon bins are delivered. She said a letter has been mailed to each home detailing the date of delivery of the bins and the new service schedule.<ep>
   Since the program will allow for a greater amount of materialsto be recycled, Morris said program revenues will also increase.<ep>
   The new program will also allow the U.S. Post Office, which wants to expand its South Miami branch, to lease or purchase the property the city uses to store recyclable material. The city expects the revenues generated from an annual lease of the property to be far greater than the revenues it receives from Waste Management. Waste Management currently picks up the recyclable material, then pays the city a portion of the revenues from the recyclable materials collected.<ep>
   South Miami is the latest city to join the Dade County Curbside Recycling program, which began in 1990. Twelve cities, as well as other municipalities in the county, take part in the program.<ep>
