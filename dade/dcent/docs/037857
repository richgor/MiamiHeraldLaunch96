<m0>     Participants can enjoy a morning outing and families in need will benefit from the Christian Community Service Agency's Walk-A-Thon Saturday at A.D. Barnes Park, 3701 SW 70th Ave.<ep>
   Registration for the walk starts at 8:30 a.m., followed by an opening ceremony at 9:30 a.m., after which the 10K walk will begin. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Refreshments will be served after the walk, said event coordinator Raymond Adrian and people making donations or pledges of $25 dollars or more will receive a T-shirt.<ep>
    The walk raised about $8,000 in pledges and in-kind donations last year, Adrian said.<ep>
   The Christian Community Service Agency is a nonprofit social service organization that provides assistance to people in need in Dade County communities.<ep>
     Services include a refugee job training and employment program; refugee resettlement services; two housing centers for formerly homeless families; housing and support services for victims of AIDS and their families; job training and placement for senior citizens; tutorial assistance and nonviolence training for court-referred youth; and a job skills development and placement program for low-income people who want to learn a marketable skill. <ep>
   For Walk-A-Thon pledge and donation information, call Adrian, 649-6682, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.<ql>
