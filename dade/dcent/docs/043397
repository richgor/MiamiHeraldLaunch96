   The family and friends of Clifton Pawley (--) a Gables man slain in his driveway April 24 (--) have raised $20,000 to go toward a reward for anyone who can lead police to his killer or killers.<ep>
   They hope someone will like the idea of having that much money more than protecting a friend or relative.<ep>
   Metro-Dade Police don't have many clues in the murder case. A tip would be welcome, said detective Dean Sermon.<ep>
   ``We're looking for some guy to rat out whoever he knows did it,'' Sermon said. ``It's like the tip in the UM case. That one piece and then, `Boom,' it falls together.''<ep>
   On Wednesday, police arrested a suspect in the brutal beating death of Marlin Barnes and Timwanika Lumpkins at Barnes' apartment on the University of Miami campus. That arrest was made after somebody called Crimestoppers.<ep>
   Pat Sessions, a friend of the victim and his family, hopes police get the same kind of call in the Pawley case.<ep>
   ``They are really counting on that money for somebody to turn somebody in,'' he said.<ep>
   More than half the reward money was raised by Pawley's neighbor Charles George, who went door to door asking for pledges in the neighborhood, near the Riviera Country Club. He got $12,000 and was still counting last week.<ep>
   ``We asked people to give anything they felt was indicated,'' George said. About 40 neighbors chipped in with pledges ranging from $50 to $1,000. Most of the donations are in the $100 and $200 range, George said.<ep>
   ``Needless to say, everybody's concerned, not only about Clifton Pawley's case, but other cases,'' George said of the violent crime that has hit the Gables.<ep>
   He said the reward money (--) $20,000 raised by friends and neighbors plus $1,000 from Crimestoppers (--) is their best hope.<ep>
   ``The police said that in a case of this kind, a reward is very helpful. These are difficult cases unless you get somebody to come forward with information and this encourages them to do that.''<ep>
