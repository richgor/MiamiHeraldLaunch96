<m0>   Arvida Middle School parents Tuesday will discuss setting up a program to provide supervised leisure and study time and possibly tutoring for students from the time school is out until 6 p.m.<ep>
    A recent story in The Miami Herald said 38 percent of Arvida students live in single-parent families, and many return after school to empty homes.<ep>
   Officers of the PTSA will take a poll to gauge parent interest at Arvida's PTSA meeting at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at the school, 10900 SW 127th Ave. It is open to parents of all students attending Arvida this year or next.<ep>
   Also on the agenda: Election of the PTSA board, and a presentation by Robin Politowicz, lead teacher at the Coral Reef Magnet High School that is to open in 1997.<ql>
