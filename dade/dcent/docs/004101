   Kendall's Jewish community is taking Sunday's FBI warning to beef up security very seriously. <ep>
   Late last week, the FBI advised Jewish organizations to be on ``heightened alert'' because of a threat to kill 1,200 Jewish executives and doctors in the United States unless Israel withdrew its military forces from Lebanon and paid $12 billion in compensation by last Sunday. <ep>
   To whom the compensation was to be paid wasn't clear. <ep>
   The FBI said it learned of the threat through information it received through a private party, which then turned it over to the FBI. <ep>
   The Dave and Mary Alper Jewish Community Center, 11155 SW 112th Ave., is one of Kendall's largest Jewish organizations, with 160 employees and more than 2,200 members. <ep>
   The organization wouldn't divulge what precautions it is taking, but said security has been beefed up. <ep>
   ``The Alper JCC, along with all other local Jewish agencies and synagogues, has been asked to review security measures,'' said Jacob Solomon, executive vice president of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation. <ep>
   The Jewish Federation was host to a number of Jewish groups and the FBI for a briefing at the Alper Center Wednesday morning.<ep>
   Pinecrest's Temple Beth Am, like the Alper Center, has hired some Metro-Dade Police officers to make extra rounds. The temple also operates a day-school for students through sixth grade. <ep>
   ``There's a risk everywhere you go,'' said Stacey Stieg, who belongs to Kendall's JCC with her husband, Kenny, and 2-year-old son, Jacob. ``But I'm not that worried about it. It won't stop me from doing what I want to do.''<ql>
