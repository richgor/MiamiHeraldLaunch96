    When the gifted students at Rockway Middle School learned that nearly 18,000 healthy dogs and cats are killed each year in the Dade County Animal Shelter because of animal overpopulation, they wanted to make a change.<ep>
     ``My students were challenged by the thought of it and immediately started brainstorming and filled the chalkboard with a list of ideas,'' said Rebecca Mazzarella, who teaches Rockway's gifted class.<ep>
     The students used posters, announcements, handouts, classroom presentations, a poetry contest and a play to promote spaying and neutering.<ep>
     ``Our main emphasis was really on kindness to animals in general,'' said Carlos Alayeto, a seventh-grader. ``We wanted to educate people to eliminate the myths that spaying and neutering are cruel or affect the animal's attitude, and we wanted to show people what can happen if animals aren't controlled: They get killed on the road, killed in shelters or used in cruel experiments.''<ep>
   Luis Soro, a seventh-grader at Rockway, 9393 SW 29th Ter., said the problem stems from a negative view of spaying and neutering. ``At first I thought spaying or neutering was cruel, because I wouldn't want anybody doing it to me,'' he said. ``But when you think about it, there's too many pets out there and it's cruel to leave them without homes, and we have to be the ones to stop it.''<ep>
   Carlos wrote a play, <m0>The Secret of Stafnor Castle<m0>, that was performed for grades six through eight. It emphasized the need for everyone to work together to solve the problem, Mazzarella said.<ep>
   In it, a mad alien scientist stranded on earth combines the DNA of humans and animals to create creatures called ``Zoanoids'' to make everyone feel ``joined and united while being useful and with worth.''<ep>
   Carlos also wrote <m0>Smells Like Roadkill,<m0> based on Nirvana's <m0>Smells Like Teen Spirit<m0>, with lyrics such as: ``There's a puppy in the street now, getting splattered by a Volvo. <m1> <m0>Gotta stop it, not enough homes. . . . So the message is very clear, spay or neuter your pet right here.''<ep>
   The result?<ep>
   ``It worked,'' said Rene Villa, a sixth-grader who said he persuaded his neighbor to spay and neuter his dogs. <ep>
   The education program, which was started by Biscayne Elementary teacher Martin Karp and the Dade County Animal Shelter, is being used at several other schools and seems to be working, said John Zobler, chief of the Animal Services Division.<ep>
   ``We always stress that the number of animals killed in shelters would be reduced if people would just make sure their pets wear identification, get spayed or neutered and don't run loose from home,'' he said. ``The kids really put these themes into their projects, and we're grateful for the amount of work they put into it.''<ep>
   ``We've had a good response considering it's the first year,'' Karp said.<ql>
