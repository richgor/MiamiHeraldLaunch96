   In September, voters in Sweetwater will have more to say about how their city government is run.<P>

   The City Council agreed Monday to put three charter changes on the ballot that will determine:<P>

   <LI> How council vacancies are filled.<P>

   <LI> If a city employee who is fired can appeal to the City Council.<P>

   <LI> If council members be elected by group seats.<P>

   All are amendments to the city charter and must be approved by a majority of voters.<P>

   Councilwoman Prisca Barreto moved to change how council vacancies are filled. Currently, if a council member leaves before a term expires, the council must chose someone from the pool of unsuccessful candidates in the last election to serve out the term.<P>

   Barreto's proposal would automatically grant the seat to the unsuccessful candidate who had the next highest number of total votes.<P>

   ``This way, the voters of Sweetwater will have a direct effect on who becomes a council member,'' Barreto said.<P>

   Councilman Manuel Duasso was the only no vote.<P>

   Councilman Manuel L. Maro&ntilde;o presented the change to let employees appeal their terminations to the council.<P>

   ``I bring this up so that employees won't feel their position has anything to do with politics,'' Maro&ntilde;o said. ``So they are not terminated due to politics and so they know we value them for their work.''<P>

   Mayor Gloria Bango, who has the authority to fire anyone at will, did not recommend the change. She said employees already approach council members about their bosses or co-workers in an effort to get their sympathy.<P>

   ``This will be opening it up to more problems,'' Bango said. <P>

   If passed, the amendment would allow the City Council to overrule any termination by the mayor as long as five of the seven members agree.<P>

   Council President Cecilia Holtz Alonso and Councilman Jesus Mesa voted no.<P>

   Councilman Jose Diaz suggested the group elections amendment.<P>

   Currently, council members run at large and the top vote-getters are elected. Diaz's proposal would require candidates to file for a particular group and run against only those in the same group. Those running unopposed would automatically be elected.<P>

   That resolution passed 4-3 with Holtz Alonso, Duasso and Mesa voting no.
