   The Coconut Grove Chamber of Commerce has been awarded a $6,000 grant by the Dade Community Foundation to improve two existing youth programs and create a new one for Coconut Grove and Coral Gables kids.<ep>
   The programs are administered with the help of the Boys and Girls Club of Miami.<ep>
   ``One of the things the chamber tries to do is reach out to various sectors of the community,'' said Allen Sweeny, chamber president.<ep>
   Established in 1967, the foundation administers funds set up by individuals, families, businesses and other organizations to support local nonprofit groups. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Programs <m1> <m0>for which the chamber will use the money are:<ep>
   (box) A student mentoring and counseling program that pairs 45 Coral Gables high school students with 45 ``high risk'' elementary school students in Coconut Grove.<ep>
  (box) The neighborhood track club and tutorial program that will provide financial support for the Curry/Grice Track Club. The club was initiated by parents in Coconut Grove. The program will also provide after-school tutoring for club members at the Gibson Center in Coconut Grove.<ep>
   The new program will provide clinics led by Coral Gables High School students and coaches of football, basketball, baseball and cheerleading for youngsters who participate in the Boys and Girls Club of Miami's athletic programs in Armbrister Park in Coconut Grove.<ep>
