   After three months of practice, it's all over -- but teachers at West Homestead Elementary are still smiling.<P>

   Their students participated in Field Day -- an annual event with potato sack races, tug-of-war, relays and other games. Winners received ribbons, but the greatest prize was knowing they could do it.<P>

   ``I want to help children achieve their full potential,'' said Peggy Gantner, the physical education teacher for exceptional students at West Homestead.<P>

   All the exceptional education students have at least one disability. Many have several. These include physical, mental and emotional disabilities.<P>

   ``Once a year, the kids can be successful at athletic events like other children when they usually can't be a part of it,'' teacher Doreen Docobo said.<P>

   Because the students have varying disabilities, teachers had to adapt training for the events.<P>

   Henry Velasquez, 5, who is blind, had help from a sighted student who held Henry's hand and walked him through the sack race course teaching him to follow voices.<P>

   Henry finished second in his race and the smile across his face was almost as large as the ribbon he won.<P>

   Charlotte Lofgrin, 5, wanted to be in all the events. She was having a great time. ``Mommy, are you proud of me?'' she asked.<P>

    Kim Lofgrin couldn't have been prouder. ``I'm real happy she's enjoying herself. She doesn't usually like going outside.''<P>

    Albert McDuffie, 5, also celebrated personal victories. Albert was hit by a car and lost the use of his right arm and has learned to be left-handed. He placed first in throwing and in running.<P>

    ``I went real fast,'' he said. ``I won.''
