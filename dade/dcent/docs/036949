   The family and friends of Clifton Pawley (--) a Gables man slain in his driveway April 24 (--) have raised $20,000 to go toward a reward for anyone who can lead police to his killer or killers.<ep>
   They hope someone will like the idea of having that much money more than protecting a friend or relative.<ep>
   The money is added to $1,000 offered by Crimestoppers.<ep>
   Metro-Dade Police don't have many clues in the murder case. A tip would be welcome, said detective Dean Sermon.<ep>
   ``We're looking for some guy to rat out whoever he knows did it,'' Sermon said. ``It's like the tip in the UM case. That one piece and then, `Boom,' it falls together.''<ep>
   On Wednesday, police arrested a suspect in the brutal beating death of Marlin Barnes and Timwanika Lumpkins at Barnes' apartment on the University of Miami campus. That arrest was made after somebody called Crimestoppers.<ep>
   Pat Sessions, a friend of the victim and his family, hopes police get the same kind of call in the Pawley case.<ep>
   ``They are really counting on that money for somebody to turn somebody in,'' he said.<ep>
   More than half the reward money was raised by Pawley's neighbor Charles George, who went door to door asking for pledges in the neighborhood, near the Riviera Country Club.<ep>
   ``We asked people to give anything they felt was indicated,'' George said. About 40 neighbors chipped in with pledges ranging from $50 to $1,000.<ep>
