<m0>   <m0>Denny <m0>and <m0>Patrick DuLaney,<m0> aspiring football stars who have not yet reached high school, are already All-Americans.<ep>
   A straight-A student at Kendall's Arvida Middle School, Denny, 14, has been named a first-team All-American Scholar (--) one of only 35 eighth-graders in the country to be recognized by Pop Warner Little Scholars, Inc.<ep>
   Patrick, 11, a student at Martin Elementary, is one of 35 fifth-graders in the country to receive the same first-team honors.<ep>
   ``I tried to nominate my third son, <m0>Kevin,<m0> but they don't have a program for 8-year-olds,'' said proud mother <m0>Carol DuLaney.<m0> ``This is real exciting.''<ep>
   Denny, Patrick and Kevin all play Pop Warner football through the Kendall Boys and Girls Club, and all made straight A's last year.<ep>
   Denny starts both ways for the 120-pound Kolts as a wide receiver and cornerback. Patrick is a starting linebacker for the 80-pound Kolts. Kevin, a running back, plays for the 65-pound Kolts.<ep>
   ``If they can only get scholarships for college,'' said Carol DuLaney, ``we've got it made.''<ql>
<m0>A hot bat<ep>
<m0>   Shortstop <m0>Jesse Cooper<m0> is swinging a hot bat for the Orioles, the second hottest team in the Bantam Division of the Kendall Hammocks Khoury League. Cooper hit a pair of two-run homers in the Orioles' 9-1 playoff victory over the Athletes last week.<ep>
   The Orioles were to play the Dodgers Tuesday in a second round playoff game.<ep>
   Led by Cooper, who hit .560 with 10 home runs, and pitchers <m0>Ruben Torres<m0> <m0>and <m0>Chris Carvajal,<m0> who were a combined 14-0, the Orioles swept through the regular season with an 18-1 record.<ep>
   ``Our only loss was to the Reds,'' said Coach <m0>Ruben Torres,<m0> father of the team's star pitcher. ``They finished 19-0. It's going to be tough to go all the way, but we're going to try.''<ql>
<m0>New face<ep>
<m0>   Palmetto Middle School, winner of eight consecutive Dade County golf championships, is going after another county title with a striking new face (--) <m0>Melanie Schlesinger,<m0> only the second girl to make the team in nearly three decades.<ep>
   ``She's ranked No. 4 on our team out of six,'' said Coach <m0>Bob Murphy,<m0> who has been at Palmetto Middle for the past 27 years. ``She's not big or strong but hits the ball well. She has consistency in her swing.''<ql>
<m0>A great season<ep>
<m0>   The finest tee-ball team in the Westchester Optimist League just added another notch to a great season.<ep>
   The Marlins, who finished the season 12-0, recently defeated an All-Star team from the Kendall Boys and Girls Club, 34-8.<ep>
   The Marlins were led by third baseman <m0>Alex Sasieta,<m0> infielder <m0>William Varas <m0>and first baseman <m0>Joshua Rodriguez.<m0><ql>
<m0>Top pitchers<ep>
<m0>   The Miami Mini-Canes, defending state softball champions, enter the Lake Lytal Tournament in West Palm Beach May 18 with two of the top 10-year-old pitchers in Dade (--) <m0>M<m0>ichelle Diaz<m0> <m0>and <m0>Ashley Ore.<ep>
<m0>   Ore, 15-5 this season, is following in the steps of older sister <m0>Tiffany,<m0> a pitching star for the Mini-Canes' 14-and-under team.<ep>
   Diaz, 18-10 this season, also is following an older sibling, <m0>Jennifer, <m0>a star pitcher for the Mini-Canes' 12-and-under team.<ep>
