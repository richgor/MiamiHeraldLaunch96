   On a clean sheet of wide-ruled school paper, little Oscar Valdes painstakingly shapes his oval O's, linear F's and stout B's almost perfectly along the dotted line.<ep>
    ``Oscar is very orderly with his work, especially with his spelling quizzes on Fridays,'' said his teacher Ana Maria Alberto.<ep>
     ``I just try my best to make my work look clean and neat,'' said Oscar, 7. ``I love to use my pencil to write and draw.''<ep>
   When it comes to handwriting, Oscar is tops. The first-grader from St. Theresa School in Coral Gables was recently named one of six Florida champions in the National Handwriting Contest sponsored by Zaner-Bloser Educational Publishers and Parker Pen.<ep>
   Four of those six are Dade students: Ashley Russell, who attends St. Thomas the Apostle School in South Miami, is the second-grade champion; Noel Bondoc of St. Joseph School in Miami Beach is the fourth-grade winner; and Susan Gregg, who attends Covenant Teaching Fellowship, 827 NW 145th St., is the sixth-grade champion.<ep>
     Noel just learned he also is the fourth-grade national handwriting champion and will receive a $500 U.S. Savings Bond, among other prizes.<ep>
   Ashley, 8, mastered the art of writing in cursive this year with the help of her teacher Sister Beatriz Magdaleno.<ep>
   ``I try to write my best,'' Ashley said. ``I count the lines and put the letters inside the lines to make everything straight and neat. Good handwriting is very important.''<ep>
     Richard Northup, vice president of marketing for Zaner-Bloser, agrees: ``Bad handwriting causes a lot of problems. Some doctors who have bad handwriting give trouble to pharmacists, causing them to sometimes give wrong prescriptions. And consider U.S. mail: Millions and millions of dollars wasted on bad handwriting every year with letters that never get delivered because postal carriers can't read the addresses.''<ep>
   Zaner-Bloser, a leading national publisher of handwriting texts for students in kindergarten through eighth grade, and Parker Pen, a writing instrument company, have sponsored the competition annually for the past five years to stress the importance of good handwriting.<ep>
    Florida's champs competed against 90,000 other first- through-sixth-graders to join the elite corps of 171 finalists from all states.<ep>
     Master Penman Clinton Hackney in Tampa judged the national competition: ``I use the four keys to legibility,'' said Hackney, who has a doctorate in education and has written several handwriting textbooks used by elementary students nationwide. ``I look at the handwriting to determine the strokes and shapes of letters. Size is next. Then, we look at the slant of the writing. And the last key is the spacing between the letters, words and sentences.''<ql>
