   Some students at Southridge High are trying to discover their cultural roots by traveling beyond the realm of school books to the realm of the Dark Continent: Africa.<ep>
   Students expect the experience will raise their self-awareness by giving them a more accurate picture of their origins, said Tim Tyler, a teacher at Southridge, who is organizing the trip.<ep>
   ``When kids know their past and how their people have had to struggle it inspires them to do much more,'' he said. ``They'll come to see they're living a privileged life in this country, and seeing what kids go through over there will help motivate them.''<ep>
   During the 10-day trip in June, students will explore the colonized and uncolonized regions of Senegal and Gambia in West Africa, visiting villages, wildlife reserves, the presidential palace, markets and museums. They will also visit Goree Island, where many slaves were kept before being sent to the United States.<ep>
  ``To me the trip is very important because I don't know my roots,'' said Dorran Nickerson, an 11th-grader. ``I know I came from slavery, but I've never seen real Africans in their own society and I want to know how I would've been like and how my life would've been if I had been born there.''<ep>
   Trevor Alfred, also a junior, agreed. ``We don't appreciate comforts we have like running water and other things they can't afford,'' he said. ``It's an opportunity for us to learn to value the things we take for granted and realize how blessed we are,'' he said.<ep>
   Prior to the trip, students will get a booklet and attend special classes to polish their education of West African culture. On the trip, they'll keep journals and do homework.<ep>
   And when they've finished their assignments, the students can hang up their safari hats and have fun, Tyler said. ``They'll have plenty of free time to explore the villages and marketplaces,'' he said.<ep>
    More than 50 students were interested in attending, but the trip's $2,095 cost reduced the group to nine.<ep>
   Obtaining funds has been an uphill battle, Tyler said.<ep>
     The group has received donations from the South Dade Leadership Academy, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Burger King and some local churches. They still need money and are washing cars, sponsoring spaghetti dinners and even collecting donations along U.S. 1.<ep>
     ``Working for your own things teaches you a lesson in life,'' Trevor said. ``It feels a lot better that we had to do all the fund-raisers because we've learned how we'll get to our goals with hard work.''<ep>
   Tyler hopes the trip will help pave the way for future student exchange programs between Africa and the United States.<ep>
     ``Maybe someday there'll be a football game in Africa and Southridge will battle it out on the field with the Senegal team,'' he said. ``Hey, the pros do it all the time.''<ql>
