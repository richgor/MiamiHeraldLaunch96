<m0>   Some water in Sweetwater isn't that sweet. In fact, it's bitter for some homeowners who live in the west end of the city near Roselli Park, where streets look more like canals after a good rain.<ep>
   But they soon may be drying out.<ep>
   The City Council will meet at 8 p.m. Monday to discuss a public works project that will ease the flooding on Southwest Sixth and Seventh streets.<ep>
   Sweetwater paid an independent engineer (--) Ignacio Serralta, vice president of Civil-Tech Group (--) to supplement a study by its own City Engineer Juan Corzo. Both will reveal their findings Monday.<ep>
   A similar drainage project on Southwest Sixth Street years ago seems to be inadequate, and council members want to incorporate those repairs into the Seventh Street job.<ep>
   The meeting will be in Council Chambers at City Hall, 500 SW 109th Ave.<ep>
