   Four-Way Lodge Estates residents may soon get the added security they have been seeking.<P>

   Metro-Dade Commissioners last week approved a special taxing district to pay for a gatehouse and 24-hour staffing for the approximately 40 homes along Poinciana Avenue between Main Highway and Biscayne Bay.<P>

   Marie Helene Cohen, chief of special taxing district for Dade County, said the next step is for property owners to vote. The county will begin mailing the ballots the first week in June. Property owners must mail them back by June 25.<P>

   Cohen said if voters decide they want the district, they can expect to pay an increase of $6,190 in taxes for the first year to pay the construction costs and $2,762 extra in succeeding years for maintenance and staffing.<P>

   Projected date for completion of the project is June 1997.<P>

   Costs for the first year will be $260,000, which includes the construction of the guardhouse, reconstruction of Poinciana Avenue and installation of the gate system. Succeeding years will cost $116,000 for the maintenance of the guardhouse. <P>

   Also included is $96,000 for a roving police patrol. The patrol -- an off-duty city of Miami police officer -- will cease once the guardhouse is completed. A private security company will man the guardhouse.<P>

   Some Estates homeowners have been paying for an off-duty Miami police officer to patrol their neighborhood for three years. The security guard and guardhouse will not only end that, but also make all homeowners responsible for security costs.<P>

   The city of Miami would be responsible for the construction of the guardhouse, installation of the gate and providing all utility services. The city would be reimbursed by Metro-Dade County through service collections from the residents within the district. <P>

   Mary Fenster, a 22-year resident, said the idea was first presented to the city's public works department by the Four-Way Lodge Estates Homeowner's Association about seven months ago because of what it felt was inadequate police protection.<P>

   Fenster has never wanted to live in a gated community, but said she doesn't see an alternative since ``the reality is that crime is growing.''<P>

   But Coconut Grove architect Lester Pancoast is not convinced the idea is good because his property is on the waterfront.<P>

   ``We are accessible by boat and others are not,'' said Pancoast, a resident since 1964. ``I don't think we are getting the protection we should with our taxes, but now the city is relieved of any burden to try because the local area has agreed to pay for itself.''<P>

   Pancoast, who designed and built his home, said he pays about $10,000 a year in property taxes. He said he doesn't know if he can afford an increase.<P>

   ``This could cost us not to be able to stay in our home when we retire,'' Pancoast said. ``We are being threatened in a different way other than crime. We are threatened by the majority.''
