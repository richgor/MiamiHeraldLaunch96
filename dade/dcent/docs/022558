   <m0>As long as people continue to place signs along historic Old Cutler Road, William Lain Guthrie will be right behind them, ripping the signs down and throwing them away.<ep>
   ``To be blunt about it, people are stealing from me,'' Guthrie said, claiming the property value of his five acres on the southeast corner of Southwest <m4>Guthrie<m2><ql>
<m0>144th Street and Old Cutler Road drops every time ``that garbage'' is put up.<ep>
   Last month's Pinecrest election was about all the 83-year-old could handle.<ep>
   The village's 24 candidates had so many signs along Old Cutler between Kendall Drive and Southwest 136th Street that Guthrie went on a daily tear, pulling down whatever ones he could reach and tossing them into the back of his Volkswagen. <ep>
   It almost got him in trouble. <ep>
   One day, just prior to the election, Guthrie was going through his usual daily grind of taking down signs along the Old Cutler right-of-way when a police officer pulled him over.<ep>
   Guthrie said the officer detained him for 37 minutes, told him to toss his signs on a nearby sidewalk and threatened him with the Baker Act (--) which allows police officers to immediately restrain someone they suspect of mental incompetence. <ep>
   ``I told him anyone who thinks he can keep Dade County's streets clean <m0>ought <m0>to have his head examined,'' Guthrie said. <ep>
   The officer eventually let Guthrie go.<ep>
   During the same campaign, Guthrie called soon-to-be Pinecrest Councilman Barry Blaxberg and accused him of placing signs along bus benches on Old Cutler. <ep>
   Blaxberg wrote Guthrie back, telling him he also thought the signs were ugly but were a necessary evil until the elections were over.<ep>
   ``It was a race keeping up with him,'' said Blaxberg, who tried to keep replacing the signs Guthrie kept pulling down. ``I admire his goal. If we can centralize signage for elections, that would be wonderful. But I don't believe in people unilaterally taking the law into their own hands.''<ep>
   Guthrie has been fighting to keep Old Cutler clean for a long time. He built and moved into his home in 1944. ``I thought it was beautiful then, and I want it to be beautiful now,'' he said.<ep>
   In 1993 he sued Metro government, seeking to have the county purge Old Cutler Road of all offending signs and traffic signals. <ep>
   ``He's spending a lot of money on what he feels is a just cause,'' Max Price, Guthrie's attorney, <m1> <m0>said at the time. ``I think Lain feels that if he doesn't do it, nobody will.'' <ep>
   The case is supposed to reach court this summer, Guthrie said.<ep>
   Dealing with Old Cutler isn't the first time Guthrie has faced powerful opposition. In 1970, Eastern Airlines fired him as a pilot when he refused to dump jet fuel. He fought his bosses and got his job back. Guthrie has spent almost 20 years arguing with FPL about a generator near his home. He's a regular at county meetings.<ep>
   But it's the signs stuck on fences and telephone polls along Old Cutler Road's right-of-way that he has his sights set on now.<ep>
   Whether the signs are on church grounds or a school yard, if they're within 300 feet of Old Cutler, they belong somewhere else, Guthrie said. <ep>
   ``This is a residential area,'' he said. ``It's not a flea market.''<ql>
