   Someone keeps threatening an 18-year-old student at the University of Miami, possibly because of her ties to Israeli and Jewish causes.<P>

   Shelly Sitton found a note last week under the windshield wiper of her 1989 Jeep Cherokee when she left the school's Hillel Jewish Center, where she works part time. It said: ``Ready to go boom?''<P>

   It was a false alarm but another in a series of threats Sitton has received the past few weeks.<P>

   When Nation of Islam minister Rasul Hakim Muhammad came to speak on campus March 28, Sitton helped organize a peaceful protest by Jewish students.<P>

   Now, she's getting threatening phone calls. Two weeks ago, someone scrawled ``Be careful -- we are watching you'' on the door of her dorm room. It got scary, she said, when a Muslim student confronted her on campus.<P>

   ``He was walking behind me and started making racial and ethnic slurs and anti-Israeli slurs,'' Sitton said. ``He was making threatening remarks.''<P>

   She recognized him from Israeli-Arab forums she has helped organize for the center, but she doesn't know his name.<P>

   Rabbi Jaime Aklepi, director of the Hillel Jewish Center, said Sitton is one of the more active students. ``She's vocal. She's one of our more vocal students in Jewish causes and the causes for Israel.''<P>

   University administration and Coral Gables police are taking the situation seriously, said Police Chief James Butler.<P>

   ``During the end of the school year, we usually have a lot of bomb threats to disrupt testing. But this one is singling out a student,'' Butler said. ``It's a legitimate threat.''<P>

   Butler has assigned a detective to the case. ``Right now, it's a bomb threat. It'll turn out to be a hate crime if it turns out to be for religion,'' he said.<P>

   That's what the victim and her family think. They contacted the U.S. State Department and the Israeli Consulate to report the incidents. Sitton is not following her regular routine.<P>

   ``If it was just a one-time occurrence, I would have been more careful but I wouldn't be so concerned,'' Sitton said. ``But because obviously someone has been at my building and knows where I live, and knows my parents' home number and where I work, I started taking more drastic security measures.<P>

   ``Things are different.''<P>

   But the triple major -- who is studying biology, political science and Judaic studies -- said she won't stop her activities with the Hillel center.<P>

   ``I wouldn't give them the satisfaction. I'm not going to stop doing anything. That's exactly what they want.''
