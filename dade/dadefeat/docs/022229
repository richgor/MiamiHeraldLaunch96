   It sounds unbelievable. But then, this <m0>is<m0>  Miami.<ep>
   A man meets a woman at a hotel. They have a drink and next thing he knows, he wakes in his hotel tub covered in ice cubes, crude stitches knitting his flesh. One groggy call to cops later, he learns his kidney's been pilfered.<ep>
   Wendy Bobadilla, a clerk at Kensington Elementary in Miami, heard the tale from a friend and half-swallowed. After all, the details!<ep>
   ``Supposedly this happened to her husband's cousin, right here at the Dupont Plaza.''<ep>
   Has the notorious kidney theft ring struck again? No, a zillon times no, but the notorious rumor sure has. It's one of two completely false (and may we add, totally bogus) stories suddenly circulating in South Florida.<ep>
   The other involves nonexistent ``Blue Star'' tattoos, purportedly hawked on drug-laced paper to kiddies. It snared a well-meaning Florida State University research assistant on the Internet and has deluged the school with inquiries.<ep>
   They're urban legends (--) twisted tall tales often about dangerous (even exploding) animals or appliances, corpses, squandered riches, or women in various degrees of undress and usually involving somebody who's not quite identifiable, precisely like a friend's husband's cousin.<ep>
    They surface, mysteriously, and spread rapidly and widely.<ep>
    At Jackson Memorial Hospital, public relations director Ann-Lynn Denker is told she's about to get an odd question. Her reply: ``Is this about a man missing a kidney?''<ep>
   In Salt Lake City, Jan Harold Brunvand, a folklorist at the University of Utah and author of five books on urban legends, finished the tale as it was being told: ``. . . and his kidney was missing.''<ep>
    He'd gotten similar calls a few weeks earlier from Las Vegas.<ep>
    Brunvand, who has spent more than 25 years studying them, says such tales spring from the ancient human urge to conjure up fiction and twist it into fact. Urban legends are modern myths or folk tales.<ql>
<m0>Drawn from real life<ep>
<m0>   J. Russell Reaver, a retired professor at FSU, put it this way in his book, <m0>Florida Folktales: <m0>``Most of them draw upon the same kinds of trickery or horror that make the earlier comic or ghost tales entertaining; but the jesting in these modern accounts of big-city life is tempered by the insecurity and fear caused by the complexities and tensions of modern metropolitan living.''<ep>
    In other words, yesteryear's spook is this year's organ stalker. Some stories trace to real events, Brunvand says. There have been reports of an underground Third World market for organs. But most urban legends are simply dark humor or serve as morality tales about common social behaviors or concerns, he says. ``They're often kinds of warnings.''<ep>
    The kidney message? ``Behave yourself on business trips.''<ep>
    Brunvand traces the first kidney stories to New York City around 1990. In 1991, TV's <m0>Law and Order<m0>  series used it, he says, the scriptwriters apparently believing it authentic. It was repeated in Brunvand's 1993 book, <m0>The Baby Train, <m0>and a 1995 comic, <m0>The Big Book of Urban Legends.<m0><ep>
   Hollywood has picked up the theme, which may explain the latest reports. On The Movie Channel last month, Miguel Ferrer, playing a hack writer investigating mysterious murders in Mexico, wakes missing his right kidney in 1993's <m0>The Harvest.<m0> Over on Cinemax, the 1995 movie, <m0>The Donor,<m0> about a stuntman who stumbles across a cartel dealing in human organs, also aired.<ql>
<m0>Experts fooled, too<ep>
<m0>     The ``Blue Star'' story is at least a decade old but, with drug concerns high, it reappears frequently. It usually comes as a ``medical alert,'' often from a fake hospital, and describes postage-stamp-sized play tattoos in the shapes of stars or cartoon characters. They're supposedly laced with LSD or other drugs that are absorbed through the skin.<ep>
    At FSU's Center for Educational Technology, a research assistant, who has since graduated and returned to Korea, found it on the Internet and distributed it as a warning, says center director Robert Branson. FSU quickly issued an advisory but it still created a stir, drawing questions from as far as England.<ep>
    ``We've had lawyers, we've had school personnel, guidance counselors, we've had PTA parents,'' Branson says. ``I know we've had 200, maybe more, sincere inquiries.''<ep>
     How the tales spread is hard to say. People aren't pulling pranks, Brunvand says. They just like good stories, especially ones that sound almost too good to be true, and knowing new ones carries a certain status, he says.<ql>
<m0>Stories exaggerated<ep>
<m0>    And with each retelling (--) like in that whispering game Telephone (--) the stories change subtly. Brunvand hadn't heard the kidney heist's ice-cube angle until recently. By the time it got to Wendy Bobadilla, it even had a place, the Dupont.<ep>
    She found the truth just as entertaining. ``It's good to know that there's not a kidney black market out there,'' she said, laughing.<ep>
   Al Boza, spokesman for the Miami Beach Police Department, simply sighed when he got the kidney call. He's used to it.<ep>
    ``A day doesn't go by that I don't have at least two or three calls from a news media outlet saying, `I have heard that . . .' But this one takes the cake. This one I'll save for my grandchildren.''<ql>
