   Clifford Leonard Benson, a scenic artist who created stage sets for The Jackie Gleason Show, gala parties and locally filmed movies, has died of complications after a heart operation. He was 79.<P>

   ``He was a very loving, good family man who raised six children, and he was very artistic,'' said his son Richard.<P>

     Benson created scenic art for the Coconut Grove Playhouse and Miami Opera Guild, and for gala parties at the Surf Club in <BR>
Miami Beach and Indian Creek Country Club.<P>

   ``Back then, rich people used to have big theme parties once every Friday night during the season,'' Richard Benson said. ``Now hardly anyone has parties unless it's for charity events.''<P>

   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Clifford Benson graduated from Pratt Art Institute. He enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard and served during World War II, receiving several medals including the Bronze Star.<P>

   ``He was an attack-landing boat commander in the Pacific and would take Marines to the invasions,'' his son said.<P>

   After the war, Benson remained in the reserves and retired as a captain in 1977.<P>

   ``One of the biggest things he got a kick out of was working with Jackie Gleason,'' Richard Benson said. ``It was a big thrill to work for him and paint some sets originally seen on television.''<P>

   Benson was a member of the Reserve Officers Association, the United Scenic Artists and the American Legion. He moved to South Florida in 1948 and lived in Biscayne Gardens.<P>

   Benson, who died Tuesday, is survived by his wife of 53 years, Irene; sons Dennis of Washington, D.C., Richard of North Miami, and David of Fort Lauderdale; and daughters Diane Benson of Miami, Karin Benson Grossman of California and Kristine DeNunzio of Orlando.<P>

Services were held. The family requests Mass cards be given or donations made to any charity in his name.
