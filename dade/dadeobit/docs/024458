<m0>   Walter O. Benton Jr. loved the outdoors. Whether working as a chemical salesman servicing area golf courses or fishing, he was at home outside.<ep>
   Benton, 70, died Sunday at North Ridge Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale of complications related to a blood clot.<ep>
   A graduate of Miami Edison High School, Benton, a Miami native and Cooper City resident, enlisted in the Coast Guard during World War II even before the school's graduation ceremony.<ep>
   ``His mother didn't want him to go because he hadn't yet graduated,'' said his wife, Elyse, who works in The Herald's classified advertising department. ``She signed a consent form so that he could join, and he graduated without finishing off the school year.''<ep>
   Benton worked 25 years for W.R. Grace Co. He retired in 1988. He was a member of the Florida Golf Course Superintendents Association.<ep>
   Besides his wife, Benton is survived by a son, Tom; daughters Terri Zell and Tammy Massaro; sister Mary Morgan of Lincoln, Del.; and four grandchildren.<ep>
   Services will be held at 11 a.m. today at Fred Hunter's University Drive Funeral Home, 2401 S. University Dr., Davie. <m1> <m0>Burial will follow at Fort Lauderdale Memorial Park.<ep>
   In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the American Heart Association or the American Cancer Society.<ql>
