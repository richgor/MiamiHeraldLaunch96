<m0>   Until she became too ill from cancer, Geraldine J. Coachman worked at the James E. Scott Community Association. Where others saw despair, Coachman saw the opportunity to help others help themselves.<ep>
   After a 36-year career at Dade's oldest local social service agency, the only job she had in Miami, Coach<m4>Coachman<m2><ql>
<m0>man died last Thursday at Cedars Medical Center. She was 64.<ep>
   Starting as a kindergarten teacher, Coachman rose to care for JESCA's hundreds of employees as director of human resources.<ep>
   ''She was certainly an inspiration to everyone who knew her,'' said Bill Allen, former chairman of JESCA's board. ``She overcame a lot of major obstacles. She was a very uplifting person. Geraldine was the mainstay of the agency. She was a world-class human being.''<ep>
   She helped make JESCA what it is today: An agency with offices from Goulds to Carol City that has helped hundreds of thousands of people. Today it offers ``cradle-to-grave'' care, from preschool to meals for the elderly.<ep>
   Coachman began working at JESCA in 1958 when it had only a fraction of today's multimillion dollar budget. Although she had a degree in business administration from Florida A & M University, Coachman enjoyed teaching. <ep>
   ``She had a lot of love for children,'' said Buford Coachman, her husband of 39 years.<ep>
   After teaching, she moved to the business side of the agency, becoming an executive secretary, then office administrator and finally, director of human resources.<ep>
   Other workers drew on her strength during JESCA's most difficult time in the early 1990s, when some of the agency's top executives were arrested and charged with grand theft.<ep>
   Through it all, Coachman stayed focused (--) on helping the agency move forward.<ep>
   ``During the crisis, she really held,'' her husband said.<ep>
   At home, she was a devoted wife and mother who read to her two sons (--) and then had them read to her.<ep>
   She sang alto at Trinity C.M.E. Church and volunteered for its boards and auxiliaries.<ep>
   ``She would do anything for anybody,'' said her husband.<ep>
   In addition to her husband, she is survived by sons Reginald L. of Atlanta; and Rodney B. of Miami; two brothers, seven grandchildren and several other relatives.<ep>
   Visitation will be from 7 to 9 this evening at the Hall-Ferguson-Hewitt Mortuary, 1900 NW 54th St.<ep>
   Services will be at 2 p.m. Wednesday at Trinity, 511 NW Fourth St.<ql>
