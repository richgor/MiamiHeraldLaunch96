   To his children, grandchildren and the neighborhood kids, he was known as gentle Papa Louis, who cared about animals and grieved over a namesake son who died with Hodgkin's disease.<ep>
   To his friends in the military, he was a brave soldier, once hospitalized with a bullet embedded in his thigh.<ep>
   Louis Polito, a private in the U.S. Army during World War II and recipient of 10 medals including a Purple Heart and Bronze Star, died of lung cancer Saturday at his daughter's home in Miami Lakes. He was 76.<ep>
   ``He was a person who kept to himself, but he was very funny, very friendly and very kind,'' said his wife, Peggy, a retired nurse. ``He liked animals and kids.''<ep>
   A smoker, Polito used to tell his wife when she nagged about his bad habit that ``it wasn't the cigarette that is bad, it's all this pollution.''<ep>
   Born in Philadelphia, Polito served in the U.S. Army in the South Pacific during World War II from Aug. 12, 1942, to May 10, 1946. He went to Guadalcanal as part of the replacement troops sent to relieve the Marines.<ep>
   Japanese troops occupied Guadalcanal, and Polito's infantry was among the first to fight the enemy. The battle was won but not without claiming the lives of 7,000 Americans and 30,000 Japanese.<ep>
   While trying to take control of a hill, Polito was shot by a sniper. He was hospitalized with a thigh wound and released a year later.<ep>
   This is what he said about the war: ``I felt especially bad about killing those people. It's a shame we had to kill each other for our freedom.''<ep>
   Polito and his wife met at a bus station. They married, moved to Miami in 1951 and had six children. One son, Louis Polito Jr., died at age 10 in 1963 with Hodgkin's disease.<ep>
   ``This is a brave boy,'' Polito said of his son lying in a hospital bed. ``He is braver than men I saw fighting. Me, I am ignorant, but Louis is smart.''<ep>
   Polito retired as a plumber when he was 62. When his wife retired in 1993, the two and a son moved to Mexico City, but they often visited their children in the United States.<ep>
   Besides his wife, Polito is survived by sons Tony of San Francisco and James of Mexico City; daughters Margaret ``Peggy'' Rosier of Davie, Maria Gonzalez of Miami Lakes and Yolanda Mora of South Miami; and 10 grandchildren.<ep>
   A memorial service will be at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Our Lady of the Lakes Catholic Church, 15801 NW 67th Ave., 33014. His body will be cremated.<m2><ep>
