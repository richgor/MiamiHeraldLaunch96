ext time the White House's Part-time Secretary of Political Correctness and Other Cosmetic Concerns comes to town to arrange a presidential visit to a local middle school, he needs to spend less time worrying about what is ultimately insignificant and more time minding the president's image. <P>

  I mean, that is what they pay Hollywood producer and part-time presidential event planner Mort Engleberg for, no?   Engleberg, in case you haven't heard, is the guy who caused a stir with his microplanning of Bill Clinton's visit to Carver Middle School this week. He rejected a black male student as Clinton's presenter and insisted on a white non-Hispanic female student.   In turn, the Miami Coalition for a Drug-Free Community, called upon by Engleberg to produce the student of specified demographics, complicated matters further by picking a private school student to make the presidential introduction -- at a public school.<BR>
   While Engleberg obsessed on the student's image, it seems he slacked on the image of his boss, the president. While he dwelled on the mechanics of sending a message, he lost sight of the larger stereotype: the white male president playing golf. You'd think a man who pays such attention to fine detail would have urged el jefe to choose a more egalitarian sport, like hoops or soccer.   Sadly, it was Clinton's golf that set the tone for his visit. The school was chosen for its proximity to the golf course at the Biltmore. Carver Middle is a small, multiracial school, just as the White House requested.   Lucky for the president, the golf course was close to a great school. Carver was one of four schools in Dade to earn a Blue Ribbon, the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. Department of Education. Last year it was the only middle school in Dade County without an expulsion, an assault or a weapon possession.   And, on the subject of busting stereotypes, let us note that this diverse public school, a magnet school for bilingual studies, sits not on a golf course, but in the heart of the black Grove.   I understand the uncluttered point the White House was trying to make: The drug problem transcends black and Hispanic youth.<P>

  But there are other ways of saying it. First way: Just say it. But by fixating on skin color, the president's logistics guy essentially toyed with students for the sake of politics. (And we might note that the presidential re-election campaign enjoyed the benefit of access to a public school, a privilege local School Board contenders are denied.)<BR>
   No doubt, stereotypes exist in the drug war culture. We can watch the caricatures on the TV cop shows, the junkies named Paco or Tyrone. But what America doesn't know, this far into 1996, is that the drug problem is not exclusively the domain of minorities? Just ask some white non-Hispanic mothers in suburban South Florida what keeps them up night. <P>

   The problem is the people who organize these events. Politically correct as they may be, the president's minions are usually about as diverse as the cast of Friends. Americans' multiracial reality lies beyond their collective comfort zone.<P>

   What's most disturbing about the student switch is that it trivialized valid gestures toward reflecting American complexities. It was quintessential politics, packaged and preordained, and in the end not as important as a game of golf.
