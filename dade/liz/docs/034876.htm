A<BR>
buela was always with us, even when she lived far away, in a small Cuban fishing village, where the road outside her house remained unpaved and the rooms once bustling with daughters stood empty.<P>

  I didn't remember her face or her soft manner of speaking, or the way she repeated the ends of our sentences, like a benign echo. I didn't remember because the last time she held me, before Cuba's doors slammed between us, I was just 2 years old. But they told me I hadn't wanted to leave her when I was a toddler. They said she loved the color lilac, and flowers.<P>

  And so when she finally came to live in Miami, she was instantly swept up by all the grandchildren, even those who didn't remember her.<P>

  She took care of us and rarely scolded us. She enjoyed that luxury that is reserved for grandmothers, that second chance. <P>

  Our mothers worked hard in factories, came home exhausted, told us to pick up our rooms and finish our homework. Our mothers were the ones who made us get up extra early when we had important tests at school, who inspected our report cards and our uniforms, who signed us up for ballet and guitar. Our mothers gave us strength and discipline. Abuela gave us sweetness.<P>

  We had many years together. They seem now like a long stream of daylight during which she taught me to cook rice and red beans, simmer dried chamomile for tummy tea, fertilize violets and transplant roses. I was especially close to her. I used to watch her poke through her garden, pulling weeds from flower beds, picking up live grasshoppers by their backs and tossing them away like bubble-gum wrappers.<P>

Master gardener<P>

   I used to think she had magic in her fingers because she could touch any plant, maneuver its soil and bless it with water, and transform it. In her house, the African violets did not simply bloom. They burst out in robust purple clusters, as if grateful for the pampering and the secrets she told them. I imagined they were the benefactors of all her stories of childhood, motherhood, grandmotherhood, of her tears for Cuba and all the years lost between us.<P>

  Her favorite bush of thornless dust-pink roses seemed eternal. Instead of thinning out with each branch she gave away, it grew fuller, as if thriving on her generosity.<P>

  When Abuela died 12 years ago, she bequeathed to me so many things, her cream-colored shawl, her love of nature, her trust in herb teas, her fear of lightning. So much has changed since she died, but even the sweep of time has not made me miss her less. I see her in my dreams sometimes. I think about her when I smell cinnamon.<P>

  I often think about her garden. Her daughters tried to save it. They each took cuttings of her rose bush.<P>

In full bloom<P>

   Some months ago, my mother brought me one of Abuela's remaining plants, a small African violet, barely clinging to life. It had languished for a while in my grandfather's apartment, until one aunt took it home. But she gave up, so my mother brought it to me. We replanted it in a clay pot in fresh soil, fertilized it and put it in a light corner of my living room.<P>

  Almost instantly, its leaves became strong and thick. One recent morning, I awoke to find it in full purple bloom.<P>

   This week, my mother was surprised to find one of Abuela's dust-pink roses smiling on her patio just in time for Mother's Day. She concluded it was Abuela's way of saying, ``I'm still here with you.''<P>

  And I know she is. I dedicate this to her, to all our abuelas and grandmas and nanas who fill our lives with thornless roses.
