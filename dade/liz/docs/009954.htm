EW YORK -- It is a jarring thing to see the Cuban rafts so removed from their context, here, between the haute industrial lofts of Soho and the patchouli-scented boutiques of the East Village. Here lies a composition of nameless vessels, the handmade rafts of anonymous lost refugees.<P>

  You'd expect to find Calle Ocho outside the narrow gallery where, last month, a young Miami artist named George Sanchez assembled the exhibit, which he called ``Museo de los Balseros,'' Museum of Rafters. But you find Franklin Street and the gray angles of Tribeca.<P>

  Then again, this city considers everything an objet d'art. Just blocks from the rafts sits a famous conceptual piece called The Earth Room. It is a big room filled with earth. It's been there, guarded and occasionally raked, since 1977. Rafts from Cuba have been around longer.<P>

  ``I have yet to see objects more beautiful than the rafts made by those attempting to flee Cuba,'' wrote George Sanchez in his own press release announcing his monthlong show. He is a 28-year-old sculptor and painter whose portfolio includes odes to identity such as iron-cast guayaberas, which he made from fiberglass molds of his father's shirt.<P>

  But his interest in rafts is more than aesthetic. He was inspired by the work of Brothers to the Rescue and his friend Humberto Sanchez, who collected many rafts spotted by the rescue pilots.<P>

  The artist planned the exhibit for a year, searching for the right space to display them. Miami? That would be preaching to the choir. He chose the Franklin Furnace, the downtown institution where the late Cuban-American sculptor Ana Mendieta exhibited in the late 1970s, the same place that lists Laurie Anderson and Yoko Ono on its international committee of advisers.<P>

  ``You've got to take the message out of Miami, or it gets redundant,'' said Sanchez.<P>

  He found the rafts too powerful to alter. He packed five of them into a 10-foot rental truck and drove up to New York. At the studio, he hung a couple of rafts on the wall, laid one on the floor, and stood one angular wooden vessel on its end so that it looked like a rustic shrine.<P>

   It seems an interesting coincidence that, not far from Sanchez's space, a young artist from Cuba was causing a stir with his own nautical exhibit. The sculptor, however, made his own boats of wood and metal and, in one case, old books strung together. He is 26-year-old Alexis Leyva Machado, known as Kcho, pronounced Ca-choe. He plans to return to Cuba.<P>

  The asymmetry of the Cuban shows was uncanny, a study of the realistic and the conceptual, Miami and Havana. <P>

   Sanchez shook his head at the mention of the Havana artist and posed this rhetorical question: ``Dude, why use a fake balsa when there are so many real ones?' ''<P>

   But the artist with the fake boats, unlike Sanchez, made The New York Times. Consequently, his show, at one of the hottest galleries in town, was the buzz of Soho. He sold all his works. <P>

   Sanchez's installation of real rafts, on the other hand, is not for sale. It is, he says, for education. Two weeks ago, he brought a panel of academics to a symposium amid the rafts.<P>

  He was warmed to see old exiles make a trek from New Jersey just to see the rafts.<P>

  On Thursday, he took the rafts down, put them into a rental truck and drove away from the polished cement art temples of Soho and Tribeca. He headed back for Miami, where the rafts will take their place amid the other anonymous vessels.<BR>
