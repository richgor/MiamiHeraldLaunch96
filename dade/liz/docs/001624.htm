ernhard Hugo Goetz did not blast to fame with an act of perceived terrorism. No, at the time he became America's most famous vigilante, in 1984, Goetz was taken by many crime-panicked New Yorkers to be an altruistic Terminator.<P>

  They believed -- as he does to this day -- that he was doing the country a favor by shooting four youths in the subway.<P>

  And in a New York minute, Goetz went from being an anonymous dweeb on the train to a darling of right-wing radio militants.<P>

   His acquittal on assault and attempted murder charges nine years ago not only reflected a city's fear of random urban violence, but dangerously widened the boundaries of what is considered self-defense. It elevated vigilante justice to Power Ranger status.<P>

  This week, a very different jury in a very different New York ordered Goetz to pay $43 million in damages to one of the young men, Darrell Cabey, who was left paralyzed and brain damaged for life by Goetz's spree.<P>

   Unlike the first jury, the Bronx civil jury decided the so-called Subway Vigilante, who is white, had not acted reasonably when he fired at the black youths. Perhaps it was pivotal that the first jury was mostly white, and the second was made up of two Hispanics and four African Americans. Perhaps Goetz's loss was brought on by his racist-tinged sentiments. And maybe not.<P>

  This jury saw not the freshly wounded youths, but a 30-year-old man bound to a wheelchair for the last 12 years. They saw the wear of time on the mother who left her job to care for him. And they heard Goetz stick to his guns, as if it were that day in 1984 when the four young men asked him for $5. <P>

  Goetz says he feared they would rob him and ``snapped.'' But he had gone further than mere outrage. After he was mugged in 1981, he bought 10 illegal guns. That day on the subway, he pulled out one, a .38-caliber revolver, and pumped five shots at the men. He fired at Cabey, and while the youth was bleeding and crouched in the subway, Goetz spat: ``You seem to be all right, here's another.''<P>

  The second bullet severed Cabey's spinal cord.<P>

  What sent Goetz over the edge? Was it anger, fear, a sense of powerlessness, a sense of power? On the witness stand, he made it simpler than that. It was a ``shine'' in one of the young man's eyes.<P>

  He believed he was performing a service to society. In fact, he thought the victim's mother should have done the same 18 years earlier by having an abortion. His words.<P>

  His victims were not Boy Scouts. One was found guilty in 1991 of taking $54 from a diabetic. Another was convicted in 1990 of shoplifting a home pregnancy kit. The most violent has been in jail for 11 years for rape and robbery.<P>

  But Goetz is no angel either. He has spewed a lot of hate garbage in the name of self-reliance.<P>

  Did his actions cost $43 million in damages? The better question is this: If Goetz could even produce that amount, which he can't, would it restore Cabey's health? Of course not.<P>

   Still, a $43 million verdict makes a critical statement.<P>

  It says Goetz's actions cannot be held up as measures of defense, just because he felt entitled, as an upstanding citizen and a $100,000-a-year electronics consultant, to shoot four guys he didn't like the looks of.<P>

  It is a ludicrous sum in many ways, more than what it might cost to make the next Terminator flick. But it makes it expensive to cross the thin line between seeking justice and seizing it.<BR>
