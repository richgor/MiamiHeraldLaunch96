<H2>Trouble again: knee-jerks of the moment</H2>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>W hy did the board of the Center for the Fine Arts disinvite noted Cuban art critic and essayist Gerardo Mosquera?    The easy answer is timing.</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->
   Mosquera could have made an unprotested visit last year -- and in fact he did. He comes here often. In fact, it was Mosquera who long supported the rebel artist children of Cuba in their criticism of the government. Most of them are here now. While he continues to live in Cuba, he has been openly critical of the regime.<P>

   But that's beside the point. The point is that he has been here and his writings have been here and his presence is undeniable in the careers of many of Miami's more prominent painters.<P>

   Disinviting him is like trying to put the genie back in the bottle.<P>

   So why did the board do it? <P>

   Because of the moment.<P>

   This particular moment unfolds against a heightened militancy brought on by Cuba's murder of four exile civilian pilots. So in the name of protest, it has become a free-for-all. Some protesters verbally and at times physically assaulted music fans attending a recent concert by Cuban jazz pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba. The scene outside the Gusman Cultural Center, just down the block from the Center for the Fine Arts, was lamentable as a rabid element overtook the demonstration.<P>

   Responding to the shock waves of the Rubalcaba protest, the CFA board backed out on Mosquera. The CFA said it didn't want to offend people in the community.<P>

   But it did anyway.<P>

   By canceling Mosquera's talk, the CFA board not only angered some local artists and art patrons, it also showed a lack of sensitivity to some of the artists it exhibits. Jose Bedia for one. He is one of Cuba's most famous painters. And his career has long been supported by Mosquera, as have the careers of many artists now part of the Miami art mainstream.<P>

   There has always been a ``moment.'' It was there, at the CFA in 1988, when about 30 exiles protested Bedia's inclusion in an exhibit. Bedia had been living in Cuba at the time.<P>

   Six years later, that moment was long gone. The painter moved to Miami and opened a show at the CFA. The man whose name was almost as scorned as Rubalcaba's lives and paints in West Dade.<P>

   It's dangerous to respond to a moment, but it's what we do best in this community. Let's note that one of those who signed a letter of protest during Bedia's 1988 show was art collector Ramon Cernuda. Cernuda was whacked with an umbrella by a protester outside the Rubalcaba concert. Because it was another moment.<P>

   So was the cancellation of Mosquera's talk an act of sensitivity? No, it was an act of self-censorship.<P>

   It gets even more complicated when you think about what sparked the cancellation. It was not the broad sentiments of an exile community. It was a protest that included some pretty sorry examples of the population, some frenzied types easily mobilized by radio agitators.<P>

   I hardly think this display should be held up as representative of exile sentiments. Give us a little more credit. That would be giving all our power to our lowest denominator. It would mean handing it all over to the figurative Cheo, narrow and angry, the imbecile who asks ``how high'' when the commandos say ``jump.''<P>

   Why give it away to Cheo? We are a multilayered, pluralistic community. We've suffered too long, worked too hard, grown too extensively to give it up to some guy who spits on women.<P>

   Miami's most pivotal moments are made of fools like Cheo. That's why it's important to resist their force.
