    The children at Trice Daycare Center, ages 2 months to 5 years, are the proud owners of their own kid-sized town.<P>

   Volunteers from Leadership Miami and Killian High School united to build a therapeutic playground at the day-care center, 901 NW 54th St. They built a post office, firehouse and school, all large enough to house the children for a lesson.<P>

   Marcia Reisman and 16 fellow volunteers at Leadership Miami, a segment of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, wanted to do a community service project that would be long lasting.<P>

   ``The concept of the therapeutic playground is to bring the community to the kids,'' Reisman said. ``The people at the day-care center can take the kids on field trips and each part of the playground becomes part of the curriculum. This way, play time isn't just playing -- it's learning.''<P>

   Others also helped complete the project. Ken Goldstein, a retired math professor with a flair for woodwork, built the houses. Art students at Killian High painted the houses and the billboards. They also decorated the sidewalk with simple games.<P>

   ``They went into this project head first,'' said Killian art teacher Carol Fontani. ``They got creative with it, adding cartoon characters into the designs.''<P>

   Steven Villazon, 19, became a design of his own. He was on a chair painting the roof and he fell into a bucket of paint.<P>

  ``The best part was taking off the paint with the turpentine -- it burned.''<P>

   The students also realized the importance of their creations.<P>

   ``Usually we just get grades for our projects, but now we get self-satisfaction and the grade,'' said Alexa Santiesteban, 18.<P>

   Dr. Jana Spaulding, a member of Leadership Miami and a physician at the Trice Center, suggested the project.<P>

   ``We put in labor, hours and a lot of elbow grease on weekends,'' Spaulding said. ``The playground is the one bright spot in their lives -- at least for now.''
