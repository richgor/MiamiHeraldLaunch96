<m1>Making a difference<ep>
<m0>      <m0>Team Metro's Kendall office <m0>has been working to make a difference in the neighborhood <m1> <m0>since it opened last fall at 11820 Sherri Ln. in the Town & Country Shopping Center.

   Last week the Kendall office began selling Metro-Dade Bus/Rail passes, Bicycle on Train (BOT) permits and dog tags. This is in addition to code enforcement, information and referral assistance. There is a public access computer available, and the staff can quickly orient you to this user-friendly system that gives you access to information from numerous Metro-Dade County departments, including civil court, property appraisal, tax collection, occupational and marriage licenses, building & zoning, waste management accounts, parking violations, criminal justice and traffic.<ep>
   The staff is available to make presentations to Crime Watch groups, homeowners associations and community groups and is actively working with the Hammocks Middle school.<ep>
   ``I would like to hear from the various homeowners and community groups so I can better understand and address the issues or problems in the area,'' said Suzanne Salichs, regional coordinator. The office serves all the Kendall area including Richmond Heights, Country Walk and the Falls area.<ep>
