<m0>   Like many other Dade County communities fighting for incorporation, Palmetto Bay says crime is one of its greatest concerns.<ep>
   But does the upper middle-class neighborhood attached to the southern end of the newly formed Village of Pinecrest really have a concern? <ep>
   ``I think they have a specific problem in vehicle burglaries and cars being broken into,'' Metro-Dade police Capt. Denis Shaw of the Kendall substation said. ``But it's mostly kids within their neighborhood.''<ep>
   The numbers support Shaw. In 1994 there were 1,583 cars broken into and 524 cars stolen in Palmetto Bay, according to a Metro study.<ep>
   Nestled roughly between 136th and 184th Streets and Biscayne Bay and U.S. 1, the 11-square-mile region, with its 23,189 residents and median household income of $64,239, had no murders in 1995.<ep>
   Another study showed 9 rapes and 270 assaults in 1994, the most recent year such statistics are available.<ep>
   The study showed response times for priority calls dropped from 7.7 minutes in 1994 to 6.9 minutes in 1995. On average for all calls, it takes a patrol unit 21.8 minutes to respond. <ep>
   Brian Pariser, a leading incorporation advocate, said he often hears crime concerns from his neighbors. He also realizes many other neighborhoods have many more serious problems. <ep>
   ``If the area is better patrolled, some minor crimes of opportunity will decrease,'' he said. ``But we are not a high crime area, even though people are disappointed in crime response times.'' <ep>
   Pariser believes if Palmetto Bay forms its own police force, the crime statistics will drop.<ep>
   That's a misconception, Shaw said.<ep>
   ``They're convinced their own police department will do a better job,'' he said. ``It'll probably be worse.''<ep>
