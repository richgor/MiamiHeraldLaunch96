   Two weeks in office and the Pinecrest Village Council is learning that nothing is as simple as it seems. <ep>
   At Tuesday's meeting at Pinecrest Elementary School, the council was ready to accept Barnett Bank's offer of space at its building at 9101 S. Dixie Hwy. for village offices. But residents objected that the council was making too hasty a decision. <ep>
   Barnett offered the council a 2,500-square-foot, fully furnished, rent-free facility. Pinecrest's expenses for the office (--) such as water, electricity and phones (--) would have totaled about $2,000 per month, Barnett said. <ep>
   That's when residents said not-so-fast.<ep>
   After about an hour of questioning (--) everything from handicap accessibility to fire escapes (--) Mayor Evelyn Greer authorized five residents to spend the week on a fact-finding mission, looking at what Barnett offered and other available space along U.S. 1. <ep>
  The council plans to use the space for meetings and as a temporary headquarters for a police force and zoning board before finding a permanent site. <ep>
   The fact-finding committee was told to report back to the council at next week's meeting.<ql>
<m0>Insurance approved <ep>
<m0>   After spending the week looking for liability insurance for the village, Natalie Scharf Lemos, who lost a bid for council seat, reported her findings back to the council. <ep>
   Lemos said after speaking with eight insurance firms, the best deal she found was a $5 million policy, with a $2,000 per year premium, from the Florida Municipal Insurance Trust. <ep>
   The council approved it. <ep>
<m0>Manager search<ep>
<m0>   The council and residents debated having an interim village manager prior to the appointment of a full-time one.<ep>
  Almost everyone agreed to begin an immediate search for a full-time manager. Though Greer leaned toward a local hiring, Councilman Barry Blaxberg didn't want to limit the search.<ep>
   ``I certainly wouldn't preclude a search out of state,'' he said. <ep>
   It was agreed each council member will pick a resident to form a five-member search committee. After the committee pares the number of applicants down to about five, the council will interview applicants. <ep>
   Greer said she would choose Miami Convention & Visitors Bureau chief Merritt Steirheim to oversee the committee. <ep>
   The council estimated the manager will be in place by Nov. 1, about one month after the village's budget begins. <ep>
  The next two council meetings, Tuesdayand May 21, will be held at 7 p.m. at Palmetto Elementary School, 12401 SW 128th St. The May 28 meeting will be at Palmetto Middle School, 7351 SW 128th St.<ql>
