   Homestead's Haitian community plans to showcase its best next weekend at the fifth annual Haiti Cherie Carnival.<ep>
   ``We thought it would be nice for others to know that we have a culture, and that we have something to offer the community (--) that's how the festival got started,'' said Micheline Ducena, executive director of the Haitian Organization of Women, the event organizer.<ep>
   The day will also serve as a way to help the Haitian youth stay in touch with their culture, she said.<ep>
   The festival, to be held from noon to 7 p.m., Saturday <m1> <m0>at Harris Field, U.S. 1 and Campbell Drive, has become a tradition in the city. Saturday also is Haiti's Flag Day (--) a major holiday in the country.<ep>
   ``It's really an event that everybody should see,'' said Homestead Councilwoman Ruth Campbell, who has helped facilitate the festivities. ``They have a great time. They really showcase their heritage.''<ep>
   Donations from the community as well as grants totaling about $5,000 from the Metro-Dade Cultural Affairs Council and the county's tourism bureau have made this year's event possible.<ep>
   Various forms of entertainment will take place throughout the day, including live music, ethnic foods, arts and crafts, dancing and face painting.<ep>
  Duvaldo Atubel, a young painter from Homestead, said though he has attended the celebration in the past, this is the first year he has made a conscious effort to participate. He will display at least a dozen of his paintings.<ep>
   ``I thought this time, I should do my duty and participate and show things that can make the festival more beautiful,'' he said.<ep>
   Unlike the traditional carnival held in February in Haiti, the festival will not include decorated floats ridden by carnival kings and queens. Nevertheless, Ducena said, two kings and three queens will participate and represent the three population centers of Haitians in Dade County (--) Homestead, Kendall/Perrine and North Miami. Two queens will also represent the African-American and Hispanic communities.<ep>
   As part of a class project, students learning sewing through the Haitian Organization of Women (a cooperative) have made the costumes for the court.<ep>
   ``I think it's a nice effort every year. It makes me happy,'' said Gislene Pierre, who recently graduated from the sewing program. <ep>
   Other art objects created by the students through the program will also be displayed.<ql>
