   Chianti, Caff&eacute; saicaf classico, and red, white and green balloon centerpieces adorned the tables. Postcards from Venice and Pisa and strings of lira coins draped the lectern. In the background, Luciano Pavarotti sang O Sol E Mio.<P>

   Dressed in a black vest, long-sleeved white shirt and a black bow tie, Marcos Camji, 11, opens small bottles of S. Pelligrino mineral water and serves his classmates. He has a white linen napkin draped on his left arm just like an experienced Italian waiter.<P>

   Marcos and 17 of his fifth-grade classmates at Highpoint Academy were re-enacting an Italian feast dinner. They were teaching the rest of the school the proper way of eating and setting a table. They gave mini-speeches on the types of food Italians indulge in.<P>

   Highpoint, which has 350 students from toddlers to eighth grade, just wrapped up a week of etiquette. The kids learned about the correct manner of answering a phone, eating pasta and sushi, greeting visitors in a wedding line and experiencing European, Asian and American cultures.<P>

   Each grade from first through eighth selected a culture: third-graders celebrated Christmas in Spain with castanets, sixth-graders brought sushi for their classmates, second-graders dressed up as 17th Century English people drinking tea, and seventh-graders emphasized the social graces of fine dining in a French restaurant.<P>

   ``We're concerned the children today are growing up without concepts of basic etiquette,'' said Alicia Casanova, principal of Highpoint Academy, 12101 SW 34th St. ``We wanted them to know about manners and about different cultures.''<P>

   ``It's great,'' said Mery Garcia, 39, and mother of a fifth-grader. ``Kids need this. We can only do so much at home. Manners need to be emphasized at school.''<P>

   The kids had fun -- and learned in the process.<P>

   ``I learned not to butter bread in mid-air and how not to cut spaghetti,'' said Garcia's 10-year-old son, Jorge, who was acting as a waiter.<P>

   ``You're supposed to have proper manners when you go out and use the proper utensils,'' said fifth-grader Sadaria Hughes, 11. ``Before, I would just cut spaghetti up and never used the spoon to hold it down.''<P>

   Besides their own presentation, the fifth-graders got to see all those organized by the rest of the student body.<P>

   ``All these presentations are interesting,'' said Steven Sanchez, 11. ``They talk about etiquette in all types of countries and how they may vary, like using chopsticks with Asian food to the way we were eating our spaghetti.''<P>

   Students also learned what foods to avoid in the future.<P>

   Sadaria Hughes, 11, took a sip of carbonated mineral water and said, ``It tastes disgusting.'' <P>

   Carlos Perez, 11, said, ``Asians eat cool food -- sushi. I didn't like it. It's raw.''<P>

   After their presentation, the students got to eat and practiced what they preached. Well, sort of.<P>

   Eliza Sorzano, 11, tried to eat a plateful of fettuccini Alfredo by spooling the fettuccini onto the fork while holding on to the spoon. She soon gave up and began to cut the pasta.<P>

   She said: ``You can't eat fettuccini like you eat spaghetti. It was good for spaghetti, but this isn't spaghetti.''
