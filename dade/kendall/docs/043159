   A new proposed rule to require all apartment complexes in Homestead with 20 or more units to provide proof annually that they have resident managers met with opposition this week from Related Management Corp., which runs eight complexes in the city.<ep>
     Three of those, Homestead Village Apartments, 880 and 900 NE 18th Ave.; Polynesian Village Apartments, 50-250 SE Sixth Ave. and Sky Vista Apartments, 1511-1561 NE Eighth St., do not have managers who live on the premises.<ep>
   ``If the proposed ordinance passes as is written, these three properties may be in violation,'' said Vernon Lewis, an attorney representing Related Management, told City Council members Monday.<ep>
   Now, the three complexes are served by the resident manager at nearby Seagrape Village, 243 NE 12th Ave. <m1><ep>
<m0>  ``It's been working, what's the issue?'' he said.<ep>
  Lewis asked the city to make an exception for companies like Related Management so managers can serve more than one building.<ep>
     City attorney Michael Watkins wasn't swayed: ``I think that there ought to be a resident manager period. Pretty soon you don't have any control.''<ep>
     Councilwoman Eliza Perry also stood firm. ``I will never support not having an on-site manager.''<m1><ep>
<m0>   Lewis told council members there have been problems of excess noise and drug dealing at the sites, but said resident managers would not necessarily improve that.<ql>
