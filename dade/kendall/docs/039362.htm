IT ALL STARTED WITH A CORNED BEEF SANDWICH: Mark Nelson and Lois Newmark look forward to their Friday lunches.

   In the back of her mind, Lois Newmark knew she'd be back to help.<P>

   Eight years after her mother's death, Newmark, now 71, felt she owed something to Catholic Hospice, the non-profit organization that took care of her terminally ill mother while she worked.<P>

   ``I knew that I had something to give back that I received,'' Newmark said. ``By volunteering you get more than you give. You get to meet people like Mark.''<P>

   Newmark became a companion to Mark Nelson, 36, about six months ago. Nelson is a patient at Mt. Sinai-St. Barry Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Northeast Dade. He was diagnosed HIV positive two years ago.<P>

   ``We've struck quite a friendship,'' Newmark said, as she and Nelson walked down the center's hallway holding hands and laughing. ``He's one of my best friends. We're Siamese. We're inseparable.''<P>

   Newmark, half in jest, recalled how their friendship started.<P>

   ``I asked him if there was anything he wanted,'' said Newmark, looking at Nelson and both letting out a huge laugh. ``And he said `I'd love a corned beef sandwich.' That cemented the relationship and we started going out for lunch every Friday.''<P>

   ``It's been wonderful,'' Nelson added. His mother visits him once a week, too, but Newmark's company is different, he said. ``With Lois I can be myself. I have fun with her. Mom is very strict.''<P>

   Catholic Hospice cares for terminally ill patients of all faiths in Dade who are not receiving aggressive treatment. Among the services, the Hospice team provides pain and symptom management, professional nursing to patients who live at home, counseling for families and patients and bereavement support. The hospice accepts Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, among other forms of payment.<P>

   Nelson's doctor referred him to Catholic Hospice. During the week, Nelson participates in the center's activities, but he mopes when he doesn't see Newmark.<P>

   ``I look forward to Fridays,'' he said. ``There's not too many people who do what she does. I think it's great. People don't find the vehicle that can bring the best things out in them.''<P>

   Being around ill people is normal to Newmark. She did hospital work when she was a nurse's aide in New York and remembers when her mother rolled bandages for the Red Cross during World War II.<P>

   ``She was a wonderful role model,'' Newmark said of her mother. ``This volunteering thing must be in the genes.''<P>

   Newmark and Nelson joked about leaving for lunch one Friday and never coming back.<P>

   ``I want it to be a nice treat and be together as long as possible. I'm not a love 'em-and-leave 'em kind of girl,'' she said. ``My friendship with Mark is forever.''
