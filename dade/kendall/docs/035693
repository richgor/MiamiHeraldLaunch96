<m0>   Hialeah high rollers can try their luck at a May 18 casino benefit for the Hialeah Foundation.<ep>
   ``Casablanca'' (--) a night of gambling complete with a Humphrey Bogart look-alike who will greet patrons at the door (--) begins with dinner at 7 p.m. and dancing at 9 p.m. in the Doral Beach Hotel, 4833 Collins Ave.<ep>
   Tickets start at $150 a person. Men are encouraged to dress like Bogart, women like Ingrid Bergman. Fez and Fedora hats will be supplied.<ep>
   Lola, a '40s jazz singer, will perform with her band and ``Sam'' at the piano. Each patron will get $1,000 in casino chips, and prizes will be given away at night's end.<ep>
   ``This year's Morocco-type theme is very nostalgic,'' said Maria Diaz, executive director of the foundation. ``It should be a lot of fun.''<ep>
   About 600 people attended last year's fund-raiser, ``A Night in Monte Carlo,'' which generated more than $35,000. The foundation donated the bulk of that money to Hialeah Hospital for equipment and supplies at Hialeah High's <m1> <m0>new Student Health Center, which officially opened April 19.<ep>
   The center provides primary care, counseling and health education to 3,000 teenagers.<ep>
    Those interested in attending or sponsoring the event should call Diaz at 696-8110.<ql>
