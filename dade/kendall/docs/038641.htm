   Even though the Orange Bowl Classic this year was punted out of the old stadium that bears its name, the city of Miami still has a game plan for the historic venue.<P>

   Miami is investing nearly $3 million in new lights, parking lots, renovated bathrooms, sod and other fixes for the Orange Bowl stadium, 1501 NW Third St. That's after $1.3 million put into a parking lot overhaul last year.<P>

   ``The comments I hear are that the Orange Bowl is fading away because we lost the Orange Bowl Classic,'' said Christina Abrams, city director of public facilities. ``That is not the case. It was just one event.''<P>

   The college football championship game, renamed the FedEx Orange Bowl, will be played for the first time this upcoming winter at Joe Robbie Stadium in northwest Dade County.<P>

   The Orange Bowl stadium houses the University of Miami Hurricanes home football games, at least until the year 2000, when the lease is up for renewal. U.S. Olympic soccer games are planned in the stadium July 20-28.<P>

   Soccer, a sport with many Latin American fans, may become a regular tenant for the stadium, which has drawn crowds for nearly six decades. A Columbian soccer game is set for May 29 at the venue.<P>

   Some residents have questioned why the city is spending so much money on the stadium. But city officials say they are obligated to make it work, and not let it fall into decay.<P>

   ``We will have a new and improved Orange Bowl,'' Abrams said. ``So we can aggressively pursue international soccer games and other prestigious events.''<P>

   Miami City Commissioners last month approved some expenses in the Orange Bowl, including $56,000 to replace the sod on the field. The city is also spending about $264,000 to put in new lighting.<P>

   ``The lights were pretty deficient,'' said Wally Lee, city public works director.<P>

   The city is also spending $1.8 million to redo parking lots, add fencing and build canopies and ticket booths, and $145,000 to waterproof and upgrade the stands. There's also $220,000 to build new handicapped ramps.<P>

   That money comes from the city's capital improvement budget.<P>

   Last month, Miami leaders also agreed to spend $390,000 in Miami Sports & Exhibition Authority funds to renovate stadium restrooms. About 18 restrooms were redone three years ago, during an overhaul, and 22 are left to fix.
