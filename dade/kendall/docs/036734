<m0>   After the winds of Hurricane Andrew devastated Perrine, residents expect AutoNation USA will help bring business back into the area.<ep>
   AutoNation, a business venture between business moguls H. Wayne Huizenga, Jim Moran and Steven R. Berrard, will move into the old Perrine Plaza, a 15-acre parcel of land that sits in the middle where U.S. 1 divides just south of Richmond Drive. AutoNation will sell used cars one to five years old.<ep>
   ``It will impact the community very positively economically from a tax base standpoint, from an aesthetic standpoint, and from a prestige standpoint,'' said Thomas A. Gruber, AutoNation senior vice president and chief marketing officer. ``We will support community functions and be very involved in community affairs.''<ep>
   It's about time, said Steven Cranman, who heads up the Perrine Cutler Ridge Council, a <m1> <m0>business development agency.<ep>
   ``For three years, we've been trying to recruit businesses to come into the area after Andrew,'' he said. ``It's been extremely difficult. We welcome AutoNation with open arms.''<ep>
   Metro commissioners Thursday voted unanimously to rezone the area for AutoNation.<ep>
   There were a few concerns, however.<ep>
   ``If this business facility doesn't prosper, in the future Mr. Huizenga may sell it or seek some other use that may be detrimental to the community,'' said Bob Hoak, chairman of building and zoning for the South Dade Community Council. Residents also won an agreement that AutoNation won't allow test drives through the nearby residential areas.<ep>
   Nearby residents and business owners said it may have been a good wind that blew down the plaza.<ep>
   ``The shopping center was never a good idea,'' said Denise Heacock, who owns a hardware store about a quarter mile from the site. ``AutoNation will employ between 120 and 130 people with an average salary of $30,000; that's a higher impact on the area than a shopping center in which most people who work are all part timers and earn much less.''<ep>
   She said people support the business because it's ``not what you'd call a typical used car lot.''<ep>
