   A plan to revitalize a section of South Miami has been put on hold until residents get more information about it.<ep>
   City commissioners deferred discussions on creating a Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) Tuesday and scheduled a town hall meeting at 7:30 p.m. May 21.<ep>
   ``This is a major change for this community,'' said Commissioner Paul Young, who called for the hearing. ``It is incumbent the city have a town hall meeting and workshop that clearly presents what a CRA area is, its advantages and disadvantages and the impact it will have in this community.''<ep>
     The authority, which probably would be the commission, would be able to spend tax money to improve roads, repair sidewalks, demolish blighted buildings and approve other public works projects in the CRA district. South Miami wants to designate the area roughly between Southwest 62nd Street and Sunset Drive and from Red Road to Southwest 62nd Avenue.<ep>
   Most districts are financed through tax increment financing, which allots a percentage of all taxes collected within the zone to pay for district improvements, City Manager Eddie Cox said.<ep>
   The district the city is considering includes the post office, the auto repair shops along Commerce Lane, Murray Park and the Metrorail station.<ep>
     The area needs immediate attention, Cox said.<ep>
 <ep>
  Residents within the area and the entire city will be involved in the process. All redevelopment plans require public hearings, Cox said.<ep>
    According to state law, the city first must prove that one or more areas are blighted (--) which can include traffic problems and deteriorated roads (--) and need rehabilitation.<ep>
   That study has been completed by Dickey Consulting Services and will be presented at the town hall meeting.<ep>
   If commissioners agreed to create a CRA, it still needs Metro approval.<ep>
    Commissioner Anna Price said Tuesday she is ready to go ahead now.<ep>
   ``This has been going on for some time,'' Price said. ``This community drags its feet. Progress is a bit difficult for those entities that have proved to be vocal in the community.''<ql>
