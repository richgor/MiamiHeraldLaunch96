  The Rev. Paul Forrey of Sunset Congregational Church has been in town only three weeks. But it didn't take him long to find out what was weighing on the minds of many of his flock.<ep>
   ``I was seeking the needs of the community,'' Forrey said. ``And the first thing that came to mind was crime. People feel powerless.'' <ep>
   So he has opened his church doors to the public and invited State Courts Administrator Kenneth Palmer to speak on crime at an open forum May 21 at the church. <ep>
   Palmer, whose office is in Tallahassee, is friends with a member of the congregation. He said his office primarily provides policy support to the Florida Supreme Court. <ep>
  ``I'll speak on issues related to crime and delinquencies in the criminal justice system,'' Palmer said. <ep>
    Forrey moved to the Sunshine State from Lancaster, Pa., a medium-size city with a population under 100,000. Yet Forrey said his old town and Miami have many similarities. <ep>
   ``Lancaster has some of the same multicultural tensions as Miami,'' he said. ``It's the same kind of melting-pot situation.''<ep>
   There are significant differences, too.<ep>
   ``Miami seems a little crazy to me at first,'' he said. ``Especially the traffic. I'm used to stopping at red lights, even when I'm turning right. Now, people keep honking at me.''<ql>
