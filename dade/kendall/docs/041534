<m0>   Renovation of Overtown's historic Lyric Theater is far from complete, but it's attracting visitors anyway.<ep>
   The Black Archives and Research Foundation of South Florida will host the 1996 Jazz in the Afternoon series, its sixth musical event to promote the 83-year-old theater.<ep>
   This year's theme is Serenade to the Lyric Theater, and features performers like the 21st Century Steel Drum Orchestra and the Ike Woods' Blues Jazz Band and Co. The concert will be at 3 p.m. Saturday on a north-side lot next to the theater, 819 NW Second Ave.<ep>
   Derek Davis, executive director of Black Archives, said the free event is vital for Lyric to muster support in Overtown.<ep>
   The theater anchors Historic Folk Life Village, a movement created to restore structures in Overtown's Little Broadway district, which boomed in the 1950s.<ep>
