   The Residents and Businesses for an Informed East Kendall held its first meeting April 24 and unanimously adopted the acronym SINK -- Stop Incorporation Now in Kendall. There were 10 homeowners associations, five large business and two major shopping malls represented. The main focus of the meeting was to get information regarding the push for incorporation to all the homeowners in East Kendall. A position paper that will be presented to homeowner groups in the East Kendall area in the near future.<P>

   Any homeowner groups interesting in having SINK make a presentation may call Mary Williams at 274-6491, Bill Rowe at 662-5825 or Barry White at 573-6144.<BR>
      Team Metro's Kendall office has been working to make a difference in the neighborhood since it opened last fall at 11820 Sherri Ln. in the Town & Country Shopping Center. Team Metro shares office space with the Water & Sewer pay station that is next to the Outback Steakhouse.<P>

   Last week the Kendall office began selling Metro-Dade Bus/Rail passes, Bicycle on Train (BOT) permits and dog tags. This is in addition to code enforcement, information and referral assistance. There is a public access computer available, and the staff can quickly orient you to this user-friendly system that gives you access to information from numerous Metro-Dade County departments, including civil court, property appraisal, tax collection, occupational and marriage licenses, building & zoning, waste management accounts, parking violations, criminal justice and traffic.<P>

   The staff is available to make presentations to Crime Watch groups, homeowners associations and community groups and is actively working with the Hammocks Middle school.<P>

   ``I would like to hear from the various homeowners and community groups so I can better understand and address the issues or problems in the area,'' said Suzanne Salichs, regional coordinator. The office serves all the Kendall area including Richmond Heights, Country Walk and the Falls area.<P>

   She can be reached at 270-4979 during regular office hours from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.<BR>
   The final report of the traffic study done for the Continental Park Homeowners' Association is complete and a limited number of copies is available at the Continental Park club house at 8200 SW 100th St. The club house hours are 2 to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday.<BR>
   This month's meeting of the Center Grove Neighborhood Association will discuss parking garages in the Village center, citizens on patrol and NET service requests. The meeting is at 7 p.m. May 13 at Hampton Inn Hotel behind Pollo Tropical on U.S. 1.<P>

   The annual membership donation of $15 is suggested and will be accepted at the door prior to the meeting. You may also mail or drop it off at 3290 Matilda St., Coconut Grove, Fla. 33133. For more information, call David Gell, association president, 448-4884.
