   The 40,000 people living in Dade's public housing projects got a new landlord Friday.<ep>
   Rene Rodriguez, Metro's director of special housing, was appointed by County Manager Armando Vidal to lead a new combined Metro-Dade Housing Agency. Rodriguez now has responsi<m4>Rodriguez<m2><ql>
<m0>bility for both subsidized private housing, such as Section 8, and the 12,000 units of public housing in the Dade Department of Housing and Urban Development, known as Little HUD.<ep>
   The future of Greg Byrne, the four-year director of Little HUD, couldn't be determined Friday night. Byrne flew back from Washington to announce the change to his senior staff late Friday afternoon. Neither he nor Vidal returned telephone calls.<ep>
   Rodriguez, 43, has worked for Metro for 24 years, beginning as a draftsman working his way through college. He says he hopes to continue programs that give people job training and other skills necessary to get them out of public housing and off welfare.<ep>
   ``It's an exciting time,'' Rodriguez said. ``There's a lot more freedom now in how money can be spent. The federal government has made it a lot easier for housing authorities to make changes.''<ep>
   Both Metro housing programs were under one agency until 1988. Metro separated them when Dade was under fire for allowing its housing projects to deteriorate into slums. At the time, special housing had just a fraction of the units as the public housing projects.<ep>
   Now, after years of policies to ``decentralize'' the poor, 15,000 people live in private subsidized apartments, more than in the county's own projects.<ep>
   Rodriguez said he'll carefully consider whether to continue that trend. Some housing projects might be eliminated, but others may stay (--) particularly elderly units, he said.<ep>
   In his four-year tenure, Byrne has continued to push to upgrade some housing projects, close others and experiment with private management. Recently, Byrne launched an effort to give Scott Homes on Northwest 22nd Avenue a $16.5 million face lift.<ep>
   He also handled the tough task of shepherding the agency after Hurricane Andrew (--) drawing some fire for renovation delays. And another headache came two years ago, when three people were indicted for overcharging Metro $250,000 for housing project repairs.<ep>
