<m0>   Gerald Roslund once spotted a child floating face down off Miami Beach. He swam to rescue the boy, only to discover the youngster wasn't breathing. So he carried the child to the beach, where he gave artificial resuscitation.<ep>
   The child lived, and Roslund, a longtime Miami Beach lifeguard and Beach Patrol lieutenant, considered the rescue one of the reasons he kept coming back to the beach day after day.<ep>
   He died Monday after 22 years of patrolling Miami Beach's oceanfront. He was 66. Cancer had attacked his body in three places.<ep>
   ``It was one thing after another,'' said Betty Roslund, his wife of 36 years. ``He was so caring. He had many, many friends. He was a great man, a great father.''<ep>
   Roslund was born in New York. In his early days, he served in the Marines during the Korean War and acted as an extra in John Wayne's movie <m0>Sands of Iwo Jima.  <m0>Then he came home to sail large boats on Long Island.<ep>
   ``He was a captain for one of Teddy Roosevelt's sons in Oyster Bay,'' his wife said.<ep>
   He discovered the beauty of South Florida in the 1950s, while sailing for clients.<ep>
   He moved here and joined the Beach Patrol in 1958. ``If he only saved one life, it made his life worthwhile,'' his wife said.<ep>
   But Roslund ended up saving scores of lives, many of them children, she said.<ep>
   He started a junior lifeguard program to train children from 6 to 13 about basic rescue techniques. Over the years of his service, Roslund won several commendations from Miami Beach leaders. <ep>
   He retired in 1980, after rising to the rank of lieutenant.<ep>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by daughter Diane Freedman, son Gerald ``Chip'' Roslund Jr. and two grandsons.<ep>
   Visitation will be 6 to 9 tonight at Boyd's Family Funeral Home in Hollywood, with services at 8 p.m.<ql>
