<m0>  Hours before Denovan Johnson allegedly stabbed his mother to death with a kitchen knife, the 16-year-old punched his older brother in the face and threatened to kill the family in their sleep, his brother said Saturday.<ep>
   But no one thought Denovan would follow through on his threat, Michael Johnson said. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``My father said not to worry, that he was just talking and wasn't going to do anything,'' said Michael, 18.<ep>
   Denovan (--) who had been in state care for two years (--) returned home in February after running away from a local facility, said Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services spokeswoman Lynette Beal.<ep>
   His parents, Elaine and Henry Johnson, had trouble rearing Denovan, who often was physically abusive. <m1><ep>
<m0>   In 1994, HRS took custody of the teen. Denovan was sent to out-of-state facilities. <m1><ep>
<m0> <m1><ep>
<m0>   Later, Denovan was transferred to a less restrictive facility called the Dan Marino Home for Boys in Pompano Beach. There, he went to school in the morning and worked at Burger King.<ep>
   In February, Denovan ran away and knocked on his parents' front door. They called HRS and told the agency Denovan was home. Weeks later, social workers asked a judge to let him live at home, although he was still under custody of the state, Beal said.<ep>
   Social workers were supposed to provide counseling for the family, but the teen didn't want it, Michael said. <ep>
   Instead, Denovan spent his days asking for money to gamble at a horse track.<ep>
   His mother gave him $500. His brother gave him $200.<ep>
   He wanted more. Denovan would wait for the mail and snatch his father's Social Security check, Michael said. His parents got a post office box.<ep>
   Thursday, Denovan punched his brother in the face because Michael wouldn't give him money, then threatened to stab the family, he said. Michael went off to work. Denovan hopped on a bus.<ep>
   Later, Denovan returned home and argued with his mother, police said, then fatally stabbed her with a steak knife. He has been charged with murder and is being held in a detention facility.<ep>
   ``Now, I'm scared he's going to get out and kill me or my father,'' Michael said. ``He told my father that when he gets out of jail he'll come back and kill us.''<ql>
