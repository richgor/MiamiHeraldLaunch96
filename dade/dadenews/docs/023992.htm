    In the middle of the hustle-bustle to expand the Port of Miami, build Miami Arena II and get a performing arts center off the ground, all within a 10-block area of downtown, comes a new proposal:<P>

   Explore building an entire new Center for the Fine Arts and offshoots of the Historical Museum and the Museum of Science in ``Maritime Park,'' the zone currently intended to envelop the new port operation and the new arena on Biscayne Boulevard near the Freedom Tower.<P>

   The museum idea, put forth last week in the Metro-Dade budget proposal for next year, is aimed at relocating the museums -- all housed in county-owned buildings -- to a highly visible spot destined to draw bustling pedestrian traffic from port passengers. The plan also would add fun museum attractions -- hands-on interactive exhibits and an IMAX big-screen theater.<P>

   The proposal has no money attached to it, for construction or operations; it merely says the museums ``are exploring options to participate in the park development.'' But museum leaders are hopeful.<P>

   ``We're eager to explore locations where there are large densities of people,'' said Randy Nimnicht, president of the Historical Association of Southern Florida, which runs the Historical Museum and did a feasibility study on the idea last year. ``You earn most of your operational revenues on those sites.''<P>

   The Historical Museum's portion of the project would be a maritime-history attraction that would include the IMAX theater and exhibits on the sea.<P>

  An IMAX theater, the museum's projections indicate, would pay for the history offshoot's operations, Nimnicht said. In Fort Lauderdale, the Museum of Discovery and Science attracted 569,000 visitors last year, 391,000 of whom went to its IMAX. Admissions accounted for $3 million of Discovery's $5.8 million budget.<P>

   By contrast, the Historical Museum, which opened in 1984 high above pedestrian traffic at 101 W. Flagler St., drew a little more than 90,000 visitors and earned only 5.6 percent of its $2.1 million budget through the turnstile.<P>

   Still, there are no plans to abandon the location; the maritime offshoot would be an expansion.<P>

  The Center for the Fine Arts, on the other hand -- which opened next door to the Historical Museum in '84 -- is ready to abandon ship.<P>

   ``When we think of ourselves in 2020, we see a freestanding institution on the waterfront,'' said CFA director Suzanne Delehanty.<P>

 The center -- which has a $3 million budget, roughly half from the county and half from other sources -- attracted only 50,000 visitors last year and earned only $40,000 of its revenue at the gate. Heavy foot traffic nearby would be an immense help.<P>

   CFA board members have talked to Dade County Manager Armando Vidal about setting aside seven acres at the 22-acre Maritime Park. After that, millions would need to be raised for construction, operations and an endowment.<P>

   Yet to be addressed are waterfront liabilities for an art collection.<P>

   ``You have to remember that an 18-foot surge came across the Deering Estate during Hurricane Andrew'' in August 1992, Nimnicht said. That park isn't scheduled to reopen until late '97.<P>

 As for the Science Museum, the Maritime Park dream is an offshoot museum, one featuring high-tech, interactive exhibits similar to those built in Orlando, Minneapolis and San Francisco.<P>

   ``We've long outgrown our facility, but we're married to our site'' at 3280 S. Miami Ave., across from Vizcaya, said director Russell Etling. Attendance last year was 307,000. Gate receipts accounted for $950,000 of the museum's almost $4 million budget.
