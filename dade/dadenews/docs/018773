<m0>   Miami's streets have been filled with explosive accidents since creation.<ep>
   In <m0>Miami Memories, <m0>John Sewell writes about paving being ``discovered by accident'' while he was clearing the ground for construction of the Royal Palm Hotel (--) where today's Dupont Plaza is, in downtown Miami.<ep>
   Rather than whack away at thick jungle and hard limestone rock by hand and shovel, Sewell and his crews simply blasted the wilderness to smithereens with dynamite.<ep>
   ``While blasting the rock on the site of the Royal Palm Hotel for a billiard room, a lot of rock was crushed into powder and looked like corn meal, being so white,'' Sewell wrote.<ep>
   J.A. McDonald, Sewell's boss in charge of the hotel's construction, told him to save the crushed rock dust and try using it to lay out a pathway through the hotel's new grounds. Dumped between board forms, tamped down, soaked with water and then air-dried, the walkway ``looked like dough patted out.''<ep>
   After leaving it overnight, ``it set up hard like cement, and it was a beautiful walk. When I stamped my foot on it, it sounded like stone,'' Sewell wrote. Roads were off to the races.<ep>
   ``Thus the first knowledge was obtained that the Miami crushed stone would cement together when wet and rolled or tamped down, and that was the starting of our great Dade County Rock road system.''<ep>
   After the hotel opened in January 1897, Sewell began using his crushed rock method to cover downtown streets. Avenue D (--) now Miami Avenue (--) was the main business street and one of the early jobs.<ep>
   For raw material, Sewell simply dynamited rock. Some four feet of solid rock was blasted from around the hotel and put to use.<ep>
   When Henry Flagler ordered coconut trees planted on the grounds of his new hotel, holes were dug by using dynamite. The exploded contents were turned into street surface.<ep>
   The material wasn't perfect. Under the hot sun, the glare from the white surface was blinding. It also tended to dry out and create huge clouds of fine dust that covered everything and everyone.<ep>
   But it was cheap and available. Rock pits dotted the landscape. Blasting must have been nearly constant. Large chunks of rock were used in the construction of major buildings like City Hall. Crushed rock was used for roads.<ep>
   It didn't take long for politics and road building to cement a lifelong bond, either. In 1899, there was a vote on whether to move the seat of Dade County government from Juno to Miami. Only 2 years old, the city of Miami committed $3,000 from its tiny treasury for road paving, primarily to keep black laborers busy and in Miami so they could vote. Miami won.<ep>
   When public money wasn't available, roads were cleared and paved privately by developers or by subscription. The five-mile track linking Coconut Grove to Miami was first cleared by William Brickell and later paved along the present course of Brickell Avenue by Mary Brickell.<ep>
   Hard-paved roads were a sign of civilization.<ep>
   In 1900, it took an entire day to travel 12 miles round trip on rough, rocky paths connecting the budding South Dade community of Silver Palm and the closest store in Cutler, said Miami historian Paul George, a professor at Miami-Dade Community College Wolfson Campus.<ep>
   ``We take roads for granted, but in those days they were of huge importance, the means of opening an area to development and to tourists,'' George said.<ep>
   As always happens, where there are roads, there are people and cars. The first car to arrive in Miami was an aptly named 1901 Locomobile, according to the late Thelma Peters in her book <m0>Miami 1909.<m0><ep>
   By 1904, the city had four cars, including a Ford owned by Dr. James M. Jackson, the physician whose name is on Dade's public hospital. Gasoline (wonder if it was Standard Oil via early investor Henry Flagler?) was supplied in 5-gallon cans delivered in a mule-drawn wagon.<ep>
   Quickly, steps were taken to control speeding. The city of Miami imposed its first speed limits in 1906 (--) 8 miles per hour on straightaways and 5 mph at the corners.<ql>
