   For years in the 1980s, Jorge Mas Canosa paid cash bribes to Dade County politicians and stashed millions of dollars in secret bank accounts in Panama and Switzerland, his estranged brother has alleged in two sworn statements obtained by The Herald.<P>

   Ricardo Mas, 45, first made the dramatic allegations in a 1988 deposition as part of a libel lawsuit he filed against his older brother, the influential chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation.<P>

   Last month, Ricardo Mas repeated the allegations, changing some details, when lawyers questioned him in another libel suit. Jorge Mas, 56, filed the new lawsuit against The New Republic in 1994 after it published an article that referred to him as a ``mobster and megalomaniac.''<P>

   Speaking on Jorge Mas' behalf, foundation spokesman Fernando Rojas issued a statement Friday:<P>

   ``The record is clear that, over the years, Ricardo Mas has engaged in a personal vendetta against his brother. Once more, the statements he has made are false and ridiculous.''<P>

   In a secret grand jury investigation, federal prosecutors spent nearly three years looking at Ricardo's allegations about the foreign bank accounts. They collected reams of records and traced money offshore but closed the case with no charges. On Friday, attorneys for The New Republic filed a court motion seeking release of the grand jury investigative files.<P>

   Jorge Mas, one of the richest and most powerful men in South Florida, has long been controversial. He has access to politicians on a local, national and international level. But his brother's allegations mark the first time he has been accused of corrupting politicians.<P>

   In the depositions -- the newest filed Friday in federal court -- Ricardo Mas alleges that his brother Jorge:<P>

   <LI> Gave ``cash for political favors'' to Dade County commissioners, with the help of zoning lawyer Tom Carlos.<P>

   <LI> Paid then-state Sen. Joseph Gersten $5,000 in cash in 1984, so Gersten would lobby the Public Service Commission (PSC) to approve a rate hike for Southern Bell.<P>

   <LI> Deposited nearly $3 million in Panamanian and Swiss bank accounts to avoid paying taxes and ``to have cash available, if he wanted to bribe somebody.''<P>

   <LI> Made political contributions to county commissioners in Ricardo's name.<P>

Questioned under oath<BR>
   When the allegations first were raised, Jorge Mas was questioned under oath about them. He denied that he ever bribed anyone, couldn't remember if he ever made a campaign contribution in Ricardo's name, and refused to answer questions about the bank accounts in Panama and Switzerland.<P>

   ``Don't answer the question,'' his lawyer, Robert Parks, instructed him, 30 times. Later, a criminal lawyer for Jorge Mas would allege that the secret bank accounts all belonged to Ricardo, not Jorge.<P>

   ``Ricardo is apparently attempting to conceal his own illicit activities by implicating Jorge Mas,'' attorney Fred Schwartz wrote in a letter to the U.S. Attorney's Office in 1990. Schwartz referred to Ricardo's allegations in the deposition as ``outrageous accusations'' and ``Ricardo's litany of lies.''<P>

   Ricardo and Jorge Mas were once the closest of brothers. Jorge Mas had hired Ricardo as his company's comptroller. Ricardo later owned his own firm that did most of its business with Jorge. But the two had a bitter falling out in 1985, each accusing the other of wrongdoing. When Jorge put his accusations in writing to Southern Bell, Ricardo sued for libel and won. A jury awarded him $1.2 million.<P>

   Questioned during that lawsuit, Ricardo Mas accused his brother of crimes.<P>

Zoning allegations<BR>
   He alleged in 1988 that his brother and prominent lawyer Carlos gave money to county commissioners ``to do favors for themselves in zoning cases.'' Besides acting as Jorge Mas' lawyer, Carlos invested in land deals with him. Carlos refused to comment Friday.<P>

   ``My attorney/client relationship does not permit me to comment on matters of client representation,'' Carlos said in a letter faxed to The Herald.<P>

   Ricardo said his brother often asked him to cash checks ``that were going to be given in cash for political favors.''<P>

   ``I knew he gave money to a lot of the county commissioners, but I was never present,'' Ricardo Mas said. ``I was never invited to meet with any of the commissioners or anything. That was something that he and Tom Carlos handled themselves.''<P>

   In a 1994 deposition unrelated to the Mas case, Carlos could not account for $190,000 that he distributed to ``prominent members of the community'' as part of a 1985 lobbying effort to get land approved for the county master plan. Mas spoke on behalf of the property owned by Carlos' client.<P>

Other sources cited<BR>
   In last month's deposition in The New Republic case, Ricardo said he ``had heard'' that his brother and Carlos gave money to commissioners but said that he knew no details.<P>

   He was far more specific about an alleged bribe paid to Joe Gersten, the fugitive former Metro-Dade commissioner.<P>

   Ricardo Mas said he personally had a role in getting the cash that went to Gersten in 1984. Gersten at the time was a state senator. He served on the Senate committee that regulated Southern Bell. Jorge Mas owned a contracting firm. Its major client was Southern Bell.<P>

   Under oath in 1988, Ricardo Mas said Jorge Mas told him to write a $5,000 check to a phony subcontractor, take it to Republic National of Miami, cash it and deliver it to Jorge Mas' house.<P>

   Ricardo said he got the money, put it in a white envelope and went to his brother's house. There, by the pool, sat Gersten.<P>

   ``He got the $5,000 and put it in his pocket for the favor that he was supposed to do, with the connections that he had in Tallahassee as a state senator. That he was going to do for Southern Bell,'' Ricardo Mas said in 1988.<P>

Differing accounts<BR>
   Gersten said that ``he knew some people that knew the public service commissioners, that he was very close to them, and he could influence them, and he would do his utmost, and try to get the rate hikes for Southern Bell,'' Ricardo Mas said.<P>

   Last month, Ricardo Mas repeated the allegation -- but his story changed somewhat. This time, Ricardo Mas said the $5,000 was in an envelope in his brother's desk drawer. He said he gave the money to Jorge Mas, who gave it to Gersten. Ricardo said he didn't hear the conversation between Gersten and his brother but knew what was discussed because Jorge told him.<P>

   Jorge Mas, in a 1988 deposition, denied the allegation. ``It is not true,'' he said. He declared that he had never asked Gersten for a favor nor had Gersten been to his home. Then he corrected himself. <P>

   ``Let me correct the answer that I gave that Mr. Gersten has never been in my home. I might recall, but I am not sure, that some time -- maybe when President Reagan visited Miami -- I think he went to my home to get an invitation to attend President Reagan's visit to Miami. Probably he went to my home to pick up an invitation,'' Jorge Mas said.<P>

Influential person<BR>
   He said Gersten, a friend, wanted to attend the 1983 event and came to Mas because he hosted the president's visit. ``I invited the president myself,'' Mas said.<P>

   Records in Tallahassee show that Gersten, at the time, was actively involved with the Public Service Commission, which regulates phone rates.<P>

   At the commission's request, Gersten proposed a bill in 1983 to allow Southern Bell shareholders to keep some of the Yellow Pages advertising revenue used to subsidize local telephone rates.<P>

   In 1984, Southern Bell was seeking a $92.5 million rate hike because of the AT&T divestiture. The PSC gave Southern Bell ``interim relief'' in April 1984 for $35.9 million but later denied the hike.<P>

   Gersten could not be reached for comment. Facing a jail term, he fled Miami to Australia after a 1992 sex scandal.<P>

   Ricardo Mas said he learned that his brother had made campaign contributions in other people's names when then-Metro-Dade Commissioner Sherman Winn's campaign, which didn't need the money, returned two checks to Ricardo and his wife.<P>

   ``I had never made contributions to anybody, and all of a sudden I'm receiving a check at my house on my behalf and my wife's behalf for Sherman Winn,'' Ricardo Mas said last month.<P>

Couldn't remember<BR>
   Jorge Mas, under oath in 1988, could not say whether he or anyone from his firm ever made a political contribution in Ricardo's name. ``I don't recall,'' he said.<P>

   Ricardo Mas said he recalled vividly a money trail that led to secret bank accounts in Panama and Switzerland. He had his own accounts there, he said, and so did Jorge. He even had bank records that proved it, he said.<P>

   In 1988, and again in 1996, Ricardo insisted that he was in a unique position to know what he was talking about because he had set up the accounts. He said he traveled to Panama at Jorge's request and withdrew money from the accounts for him.<P>

   ``Some of the money I brought back from Panama was at his insistence from his secret bank accounts. I would give it to him in cash, and that was for payoffs, too,'' Ricardo said.<P>

   Ricardo said Jorge stashed the money in Panama to evade taxes and have funds available to pay bribes. ``For tax purposes, or to have cash available, if he wanted to bribe somebody,'' he said.<P>

Silent on accounts<BR>
   Jorge Mas never answered questions about the bank accounts when he was questioned under oath in 1988.<P>

   His civil lawyers wouldn't let him.<P>

   Nor would the lawyer allow him to answer whether he had signed his name to documents from bank accounts in Panama that bore a signature of ``Jorge Mas.''<P>

   During the 1990 libel trial, criminal defense attorney Schwartz made a surprise appearance. He said he was representing Jorge Mas, a transcript of the sidebar discussion shows.<P>

   Schwartz told the judge that Ricardo had a vendetta against Jorge and was trying ``to get his brother indicted'' by going to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami with allegations about offshore accounts.<P>

   Schwartz said he had sent investigators to Panama who determined that the bank accounts belonged to Ricardo, not Jorge. Schwartz said the documents that showed Jorge Mas had signatory power over the accounts were forgeries. Schwartz said Jorge wanted Ricardo indicted for making false statements.<P>

   The federal investigation closed with no charges against either brother.<P>

   Ricardo won his libel suit in 1990.<P>

Letter made public<BR>
   Two years later, as part of a settlement with Jorge, he sent a letter to Aaron Podhurst, Jorge Mas' lawyer. He gave his brother the right to make the letter public, which Mas did Friday.<P>

   ``It is my intention and purpose to put an end to the family controversy between my brother, Jorge Mas Canosa and me, which has been embarrassing and detrimental to him and specially to the cause and ideals of a free Cuba which my brother Jorge has led for more than thirty years,'' Ricardo wrote.<P>

   ``To say the least, I certainly share the concern of many in the community who feel the press and the Cuban government have unjustly used our ongoing litigation, over business matters, to try to discredit him.''<P>

   He called his brother principled and said ``justice did not prevail'' in the libel case.<P>

   When questioned under oath last month, Ricardo repeated all his previous allegations. He said Podhurst had drafted the 1992 letter but refused to elaborate.<P>

   ``The reason I refuse to answer that question is because I enter into confidentiality agreement with my brother Jorge,'' Ricardo said. ``When we signed both agreed that none will be talked about, told about or said about; and I'm going to keep my part of the agreement.''<P>

   It wasn't the first time Ricardo and Jorge fought, then made up.<P>

   In the 1990 libel case, Ricardo testified that Jorge paid him $245,000 as a settlement in a previous lawsuit stemming from a fistfight between the brothers. Most of the money was delivered in Panama -- in cash.<P>

   ''I told him that as long as I got my money, I didn't care if I got paid here, in Panama, in Switzerland or in Hong Kong,'' Ricardo Mas said.
