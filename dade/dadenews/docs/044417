   A second bond hearing has been scheduled for Labrant ``Anthony'' Dennis, the man accused of slaughtering University of Miami linebacker Marlin Barnes and his friend Timwanika Lumpkins.<ep>
   On May 21, Dade Circuit Judge Ellen Sue Venzer will hear arguments from prosecutor Flora Seff and defense attorney Ronald Guralnick concerning the possibility of bail before trial. Seff was out of town and unavailable for comment.<ep>
   The procedure, known as an Arthur hearing, is important for defendants because the state often discloses early on what evidence it has against them.<ep>
   The burden of proof against bail also rests with the state, although it is rare that someone charged with murder is granted bond.<ep>
   ``There is no physical evidence that will tie my client to this case,'' defense lawyer Guralnick said Monday morning, moments after his client was denied bond at his first official court appearance.<ep>
   Metro-Dade police arrested Dennis, 23, last week and accused him of using a shotgun to bludgeon Barnes and Lumpkins on April 13 inside Barnes' campus apartment.<ql>

<m0>   Following a tip to Crimestoppers, detectives found the shotgun owner who said he lent the gun to Barnes before the killings. Detectives later recovered the damaged weapon, which they claim they have linked to the murder scene.<ql>

<m0>   Guralnick insists that Dennis had no reason to kill anyone, especially Lumpkins.<ep>
   ``He had a very loving relationship with her,'' he said. ``They went to buy a car that day. He took her to get a manicure. They were seen in a mall hand in hand.''<ep>
   Police have also charged Dennis' brother, Michael, alleging that he violated his probation by threatening to shoot a witness in the homicide case.<ep>
   Michael Dennis is also being held without bond.<ep>
