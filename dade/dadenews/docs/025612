<m0>   A Cuban exile went to the offices of the <m0>Cuban American National Foundation <m0>in Miami last week and said he had orders from Cuban President Fidel Castro to assassinate leaders of the foundation, said a source familiar with the case.<ep>
   The source said that several days ago, a Cuban who had been in Miami for some time went to foundation offices at 7300 NW<m0> <m0>35th Ter. and said he had orders from Havana to kill several foundation leaders, including Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman; Francisco ``Pepe'' Hernandez, president; and Ninoska Perez, director of La Voz de la Fundacion, the organization's radio station. <ep>
   The foundation staff contacted the FBI after hearing the man's account, the source said. The foundation declined to comment on the matter. <ep>
   The source did not know the name or the current location of the self-declared Castro agent. <m1><ep>
<m0>   The FBI was tight-lipped about the incident. ``We are not going to make any comment,'' FBI spokesman Paul Miller said. <m1><ep>
<m0>   But a law enforcement source who asked not to be identified told The Herald on Saturday that the supposed plot was ``craziness'' and that the man who confessed is not considered credible.<ql>
