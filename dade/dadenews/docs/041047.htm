George Bush to visit Coconut Grove<BR>
   Former President George Bush will be at the Kampong in Coconut Grove today for a private luncheon to raise money to take children to the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico, a favorite troupe of his Mexico-born daughter-in-law Columba Bush.<P>

   Founded 40 years ago by Amalia Hernandez, Mexico's equivalent of America's Martha Graham, the company will tour the United States from Sept. 10 through Oct. 20, closing with performances at Miami Beach's Jackie Gleason Theater Oct. 18-20.<P>

   Columba Bush is honorary chairwoman of the Children's Cultural Education Fund for Folklorico, which she and Hernandez founded five years ago. In Miami, 5,000 students are expected to see performances free through her fund-raising efforts.<P>

   Jordan Bock, a consultant helping organize today's event, said sponsorships start at $10,000 and have no upper limit.<P>

    A North Central Dade man distraught over his dog's death is accused of beating his pregnant girlfriend and then killing an innocent bystander standing on the street outside his home, police said.<P>

   Metro-Dade homicide detectives have a first-degree murder warrant out for Ulyses Herrera, 24, of 9375 NW 30th Ct. They said Herrera is wanted in connection with the killing of Jose Bottino, 32, of Hialeah.<P>

   Herrera allegedly beat his five-months pregnant girlfriend with a can Wednesday after becoming enraged over his dog's death, police said. After the beating, Herrera looked in his wallet and said money was missing. He then told her that ``someone was going to die'' because of his dog and money.<P>

   He looked out the window saw Bottino on the street and went out to confront him with a gun, police said. Bottino was shot several times before Herrera fled on a green bicycle. Anyone with information can call Crimestoppers at 471-TIPS.

<H2>2 young children left alone 5 hours</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   Two boys, a 3-month-old baby and a 3-year-old, were in HRS custody Thursday after being left alone five hours in their mother's Miami Beach apartment, a police spokesman said.<P>

   Sgt. Ed Avila said a neighbor discovered the unattended children about 1 p.m. and notified social workers with the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. The social workers took custody of the boys, who live in the 8100 of block Crespi Boulevard, and notified police.    The children showed no signs of physical abuse, Avila said, but were taken to Mount Sinai Hospital to be checked out. Their mother, whom police declined to identify, left the apartment about 8 a.m.<P>

<!-- end headlines -->

   More than 50 supporters of Raul Martinez milled about the federal courthouse in Miami on Thursday, hoping for a verdict in the Hialeah mayor's third corruption trial. But after the second day of deliberations, there was none.<P>

  Jurors reheard some testimony from developer Silvio Cardoso to determine whether the former Hialeah councilman feared ``economic loss'' when he agreed to sell Martinez 10 parcels of land at cost. <P>

  Jurors then spent more than five hours deliberating before asking the judge at 4 p.m. if they could break for the day. Deliberations will resume at 9 a.m. today. <P>
