<m0>   A sterilized cotton swab could be the key to identifying missing children more quickly.<ep>
   Miami Beach Police on Monday became the first department nationwide to issue a home DNA identification kit to all elementary school children. <ep>
   Designed by Child Trace International of Fort Lauderdale, the kit consists of a <m4>Matthews<m2><ql>
<m0>Q-tip, a pair of rubber gloves, and a small container. The child's parent, wearing the gloves to keep the cotton swab sterile, rubs the swab against the inside of the child's cheek, then puts it in the container until needed.<ep>
   Joe Matthews, a retired Beach detective, came up with the idea after working on the Baby Lollipops case in 1990. In that case, the body of 3-year-old Lazaro Figueroa was found in a wealthy Miami Beach neighborhood, but his identity remained a mystery for several months.<ep>
    ``I found it very disturbing that one can easily obtain the history of an automobile, but we cannot effectively identify an abandoned child,'' Matthews said.<ep>
   The kit also could help investigators find missing children before any harm comes to them. They can match evidence, such as a strand of hair, against the sample. <ep>
   ``It gives a permanent way to identify a loved one,'' said John Walsh, host of the television show, <m0>America's Most Wanted. <m0>Walsh's son, Adam, was abducted from a Hollywood shopping mall and murdered in 1981. <ep>
   Until now, the only records most parents had to offer police were fingerprints and photographs. Police say those are not as reliable as the DNA because the prints are often smudged and photos may be out of date.<ep>
   Mount Sinai Hospital, which purchased all of the kits being handed out, also will provide a kit to every newborn in their facility.<ep>
   Parents with older children, or those who do not live on Miami Beach, can buy the kit for about $10 at Wal-Mart stores in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.<ep>
   ``It's scary to think we have to do this these days,'' said Sonia Oates, whose daughter, Felicia, 9, attends South Pointe Elementary School. ``But we live in a society where we have no choice.''<ep>
