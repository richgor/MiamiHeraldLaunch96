<m0>  Maturity, and the fact he has a shot at being House speaker in 1998, sent Logan up the leadership chart. He is the finance and taxation chairman. Midsession, he took the reins of a panel to redraw boundaries of a North Florida congressional district when they were declared unconstitutional. In the session's final days, he was the negotiator with the Senate on tax breaks for businesses (--) a role that salvaged a crucial economic development bill. He belonged to Speaker Peter Wallace's inner circle. His off-session work included leading a panel on voter lists that eventually will link Florida's 67 counties in a statewide voter registration database. He also was a leader among the 15 House members of the Black Caucus. A prime example of his leadership came at session's end. The House defeated a $250,000 settlement for Jesse Hill, a black man who was falsely arrested and injured during a weeklong stay in Dade County Jail. Logan rallied the caucus to lobby House members to reconsider the plan. They did (--) and they voted for Hill's settlement.<ql>

<m0>  Garcia is a poster boy for the Republican Party's growing clout in the House. In his second session as vice chair of the prestigious budget panel, he narrowed his focus almost exclusively to money issues. The work prepares him to run the Appropriations Committee, which he's likely to do if the GOP gains control of the House. Garcia gave up his slot on two committees with major impact on South Florida: commerce and health care. His stellar moment came as a yearly money fight reached its peak among urban and rural school systems. He and Tampa Rep. Jim Davis came up with a plan that protected urban schools from losing the extra money they get for operating in more expensive areas. It was not the final plan, but it led to a resolution that meant it was a good session for urban districts. As for homefront successes: He helped make the deal allowing Hialeah Park to broadcast and take bets on live races from Calder Race Course. And he passed a bill that allows school districts to use part of their lottery money for school construction bonds.<ql>

<m0>  This veteran lawmaker, known for having a hand in most major issues, developed an obsessive grip on a consumer-friendly bill protecting homeowners. The insurance chairman's aim: Keep down insurance costs in a market paralyzed by Hurricane Andrew. His plan allows insurers to offer hurricane coverage with big deductibles as high as 10 percent. Homeowners would pay more of the cost to repair hurricane-damaged homes, and keep down insurance costs. Those who take the jumbo deductibles would be assured that companies could not cancel their plans for five years. The Senate had an industry-friendly plan giving insurers almost open-ended license to raise premiums. It allowed jumbo deductibles, but didn't ask homeowners to prove they could afford the extra repair costs, as Cosgrove's plan did. Such was the standoff the last night of the session. With the aid of Senate President Jim Scott and Sen. Ken Jenne, Cosgrove prevailed. The plan that passed was worth Cosgrove's obsession: It extends a ban to keep insurers from dropping large numbers of clients.<ql>

<m0>  It was a good year for the Tourism chair, who last session saw myriad projects go down the drain. One was a plan privatizing the Commerce Department and Florida's tourism commission, giving tax breaks to expanding businesses and $15 million to seaports. Republicans backed the economic development plan this time, so it passed the GOP-led Senate, where it died last year. She fought to provide health benefits for cops and firefighters catastrophically injured on the job. She was a vociferous debater on most any topic: philosophical ones like school prayer, which she opposes; hometown issues such as money for Dade cultural groups; and issues to benefit her lobbyist friend Bob Levy, who often camps out in her office. Among Levy clients whose issues Bloom heavily promoted were the Florida Nurses Association and firms that buy insurance policies from terminally ill patients.<ql>

<m0>  This lawyer can argue a convincing case, and that is one of her most effective tools. Another is her post chairing the criminal justice budget-writing panel. She helped land $1,375,000 for a Dade juvenile justice center. Public defenders are also grateful to her. She created a trust fund to help them in their quest to decide who is truly unable to afford a lawyer. Defendants may not be so grateful. Now they'll pay a $40 fee so courts can run checks to see if they're indigent. (Judges, however, can waive the fee.) Roberts-Burke wrapped it into a bill closing a loophole that allowed young Francisco Del Rey (--) who killed three men and maimed another with his speeding Corvette (--) to bill taxpayers for legal expenses. His parents, whose home is worth more than $1 million, don't have to pay because their teenage son was charged as an adult. The bill won't allow that to happen again. Another change Roberts-Burke had a hand in: prayer in public schools. The deeply religious lawmaker urged colleagues to keep the controversial plan in a bill to raise education standards. They did.<ql>

<m0>  Credit an election year for this well-spoken debater's drop in the rankings. Last year, the ex-Democrat worked closely with Democrats. But facing elections that may hand a Democrat-led House to the GOP, he took a proactive party role. Translation: a possible chairmanship in a GOP takeover. So the Cuban Caucus chair's work included image-building for timid Republicans like Bruno Barreiro. The criminal defense lawyer also pushed for tougher criminal laws: the Jimmy Ryce Act forces sexual predators to report their whereabouts to officials. Democrats wouldn't hear his plan to double homestead exemptions for low-income elderly. Even Republicans worked against him. Rep. Luis Rojas, one of three splitting from the Cuban Caucus, killed his constitutional amendment requiring prisoners to serve 85 percent of their terms. Rojas amended it to 100 percent, effectively killing it by leaving no breathing room for overcrowded prisons. Villalobos made his own statements against the breakaway Cuban Caucus members. His was the only no vote on Rep. Carlos Valdes' bill to regulate body-piercing.<ql>

<m0>  The Republican leader protempore is known for defending his Little Havana constituents. He helped eliminate a statute of limitations for crimes that cause death. He pushed for it because a hit-and-run driver confessed (--) <m0>after<m0> a prosecution deadline (--) to fleeing a scene where he killed a 7-year-old Little Havana boy. Morse worked to ease medical residency requirements for older foreign-trained doctors unable to take a final part of a U.S. licensing exam. The problem: A prerequisite to the exam is serving a residency, something usually given to doctors just out of medical school. His plan created special internships for older doctors. Another Morse hometown issue: a get-tough bill on unruly schoolkids. It allows districts to expel kids to second-chance schools if they assault school employees. Watch for it to appear in campaign literature for Manty Sabates-Morse, the lawmaker's wife (--) a school board candidate. Ever mindful of district demographics, he sponsored a bill urging Congress to grant permanent residency status to Nicaraguans in the United States who are seeking asylum.<ql>

<m0>  A toast to the Capitol's chairman of vice. Geller, who chairs the House committee regulating gambling and alcohol, had a productive session. In fact, he accomplished something that previous chairmen of the House Regulated Industries Committee did not: He got all sides in the fractious parimutuel industry to agree on a bill providing tax breaks for racetracks and jai-alai frontons. Also approved were new varieties of gambling, including poker cardrooms at tracks and simulcasting of entire racing programs at out-of-town tracks. To seal the deal, Geller made concessions to Hialeah Park that, in effect, convert the floundering thoroughbred track into Florida's first off-track betting parlor by allowing it the exclusive right to simulcast races from nearby competitor Calder Race Course. What's at stake, Geller argued, is the survival of what he called the fourth largest industry in Florida.<ql>

<m0>  A second-year lawmaker, Horan has made good use of a long history as a legislative aide. She knows how to pass laws. The only legislator from the Keys (--) who also represents South Dade (--) also knows how to take care of the home town. She got money for an interpretive center at Islamorada's Windley Key Quarry Fossil Reef. The majority whip bucked the governor's budget by persuading lawmakers to cap at 90 percent the amount local taxpayers contribute to their school budget. The governor tried to raise that to 95 percent. It's a big deal for property-rich, pupil-poor Monroe. Although the district charges the state's minimum required tax rate, Monroe taxpayers pay nearly the entire school budget. Many counties get most of their school budget from the state. Horan also had a big effect on school districts statewide. Lawmakers passed a bill with her plan to let parents have a say in which public school their child will attend. Now school districts must map out a strategy for controlled open enrollment by the 1997-98 school year.<ql>

<m0>  He's a lawyer promoting a trial lawyer's agenda, but Lacasa pushes a much broader agenda as well. This year, it meant being parochial (--) by trying to block a sales-tax rebate for the Miami Heat if the team went to Broward. It also meant delving into statewide issues like water pollution and welfare reform. But back to the lawyerly agenda. For the second year, Lacasa pushed a bill allowing parents to sue for medical mistakes on their infants until the child turns 8. That's twice the time they have now. It passed on the inspiration of an 8-year-old West Palm Beach boy whose injury came to light years after doctors misdiagnosed him. Another Lacasa win of statewide impact: a plan to expel kids who hurt or threaten to hurt teachers. One moment, he plays a role in a sweeping welfare reform package. The next, he sponsors a plan pitting Dade versus Broward. He pushed a racing-dates plan to benefit Hialeah Park to the detriment of Gulfstream in Hallandale. Like his Heat plan, it failed.<ql>

<m0>  He stood on the sidelines this year as his legendary mom, U.S. Rep. Carrie Meek, visited the House floor. But the young ex-highway trooper has begun to make a name of his own in the House. He runs a law enforcement panel. His modus operandi: pairing kids and crime issues. He created a Police Athletic League license tag to raise money for programs to keep kids off the streets. He helped pass a bill to strip licenses from drivers under 21 caught with a trace of alcohol on their breath. He recruited Dade schoolkids to lobby for the plan. Meek took a Miami-to-Tallahassee bus ride with Dade high schoolers who came to lobby for better schools. That's another subject close to his heart. Fearing the effect of charter schools (--) set up by private groups but paid for by public dollars (--) he pushed for a back-up plan to allow public schools to also open charter schools. Meek successfully lobbied to earmark $800,000 for awards to schools with innovative ideas to expand AIDS education programs.<ql>

<m0>  This skillful debater knows the politics of the process. He must, representing Dade and Collier counties. But he often used his skills to stir up trouble with the Cuban Caucus, a group from which he resigned. He defeated a constitutional amendment by caucus chair Alex Villalobos to make prisoners serve 85 percent of their terms. Rojas amended it to 100 percent, effectively killing the plan, since ``100 percent'' offers prison officials no leeway to relieve overcrowding. Fortunately for his district, he's effective in other ways. He cut a deal allowing Hialeah Park to simulcast races from Calder Race Course. He created a commission to attract the Olympics to Florida. He tried, but failed, to circumvent Dade's charter and let Floridians vote on giving Metro commissioners a tenfold raise. He doesn't mind being a loner: He was the only Republican voting against a bill with a school-prayer provision. He helped end a two-year battle between Homestead and the parents of a boy left paralyzed and mentally retarded after a botched treatment at a city hospital. But he didn't end his own battle with the Cuban Caucus.<ql>

<m0>  You can tell by Betancourt's session that she faces stiff competition this fall. House Democrats, praying to keep their narrow majority, have seen to it she is associated with major bills after a subpar freshman year. To her credit, she did break out of her shell. Unlike 1995, when she barely uttered a word, she debates often in the House. Her tiny leadership role, chairing a commerce subpanel, led her to sponsor the Workforce Florida Act, which aims to beef up work skills. She worked on high-profile bills like boating safety. Prompted by the fatal collision between Gloria and Emilio Estefan's boat and a water bike, it requires young boaters to take safety courses. The Miami-Dade Community College administrator and many others tried to make schools' share of lottery money more of the enhancement it was meant to be. Few issues passed primarily on her work alone. One that did: a plan giving school cops the ability to make arrests beyond school borders. Even so, Democrat Speaker-designate Buzz Ritchie traveled from Pensacola to launch it with her at a Dade press conference.<ql>

<m0>  Bullard is an entertaining debater on many topics, but down deep she's a lawmaker with one issue: education. That made her part of a crowd in a year that focused on schools. Her contribution: an 800 number where kids can call to anonymously report violent school activity. Her session is most memorable for a dramatic speech to support spanking of unruly schoolkids. Her reason, emphasized with simulated whacks on the House floor, is that spanking is the only tool to make some kids, like her son, listen: ``DON'T (WHACK) STEP (WHACK) OFF (WHACK) THE (WHACK) CURB!'' she cried. The Dade delegation vice chair helped defend money for urban districts. It didn't bring her closer to Dade Superintendent Octavio Visiedo. During an Education Committee meeting, she was embarrassed when others told her Dade hadn't provided them with some statistics. The result: a series of angry exchanges between the two. Bullard said Visiedo threatened her husband's job, a charge Visiedo denied. Her husband is one reason she focuses almost exclusively on education issues. He is a Dade school principal.<ql>

<m0>  This preacher proselytized most of the session on personal issues. He won a specialty license tag for his alma mater, Bethune-Cookman College. He tried to get $1 million for the Martin Luther King Institute for Non-Violence, where he's unpaid chairman of the board. The institute ended up with $200,000, the same as this year. He had better luck as a voice among many blocking plans to deregulate cosmetologists and barbers. He strongly opposed an early version of a House welfare bill. But on some issues, Bush couldn't decide how to vote. When the House passed a bill raising high school graduation standards and allowing prayer in schools, he voted no. He later changed his vote: ``I didn't want to vote against prayer.''

He dedicated much of his time in the state House trying to influence U.S. policy and U.S. foreign policy (--) and mimicking federal laws already on the books. At least he was good at it. Rodriguez-Chomat, impassioned by exile issues, passed a law patterned after the embargo-tightening Helms-Burton law.

He passed a resolution condemning Cuba for shooting down four Brothers to the Rescue fliers.

He tried, but failed, to create a task force to study the potential effect of a Proposition 187-style ban on social services to undocumented immigrants.

<m0>  This lawmaker tried to overcome his sorry lack of debating skills (--) a liability for any politician. So with quavery voice, he chimed in more often, coached by fellow members of the Cuban Caucus. Usually, his subject included a plan to ease licensure for foreign-trained doctors. He tacked versions of that plan onto several bills in the session's final week. Some passed. If at least one becomes law, a group of Cuba- and Nicaragua-trained doctors will be able to skip serving a residency before taking a national licensing exam. Or Florida will create for them a special exam, based on an old one phased out a few years ago. His less fruitful moves: He tried to block a Miami Heat tax break if the team moved out of Dade, and pushed to give prime winter racing dates to Hialeah Park. Barreiro, whose family just sold its interests in a Miami health maintenance organization, was the only House member to vote against an HMO reform bill. He said he didn't like the part, later deleted, giving patients direct access to dermatologists.<ql>

<m0>  It was such a tough year for this lawmaker that he sent out press releases on his <m0>losses<m0>. March 27, 1996: ``After weeks of heated debate, insurance companies, through strong-arm tactics, defeated pro-consumer legislation intended to inform and protect the public.'' The failed plan? Consumers would have to be informed if mechanics used parts from wrecked cars to repair their vehicles. It never came close to the floor. And that was the kind of session Diaz de la Portilla had. One of a few Republicans to hold a vice chairmanship (--) on ethics and elections (--) he saw an elections reform package go up in smoke the last night of the session. The best he could hope for was to co-sponsor some get-tough crime bills. One that passed: a law to suspend the licenses of drivers under 21 caught with a trace of alcohol on their breath. He also made philosophical stands on the House floor. He was the only Republican voting against an early welfare bill. He said later that he voted no in solidarity with black lawmakers, who voted en bloc against the plan.<ql>

<m0>  Once again, this energetic lawmaker landed at the bottom of the heap. And once again, it would be easy to argue she deserved better. She was a forceful advocate on a subject near to the heart of her elderly constituents: disabled parking. She passed a sweeping plan to reform the way disabled tags are handed out and enforced. Everyone now possessing a disabled tag will have to reapply under stricter requirements. Her bill cracks down on doctors who hand out tags like candy. And those using tags that don't belong to them will face stiff penalties. Heyman also will have an impact on false alarms. The ex-cop passed a plan requiring a license (--) and backgound checks (--) of anyone who installs burglar alarms in Florida. When an alarm sounds, monitoring companies will have to call homeowners first before calling the cops. And all new contractor-installed alarms will have to have a switch that shuts off an audio alarm after 15 minutes. For that, the neighbors can be grateful. Heyman also helped pass a law requiring young boaters to take safety courses.<ql>

<m0>  This conservative, dyed-in-the-wool Republican kept with his tradition of working on education issues (--) but this time he actually had some success in the Democrat-run House. Credit the GOP-run Senate for moving the Legislature more in line with Valdes' point of view. He passed his plan to expel problem kids to ``second-chance'' schools for closer supervision. He pushed, less successfully, to require that one of the new publicly funded, privately run charter schools be in Little Havana. Yet he made light of a bill to ban smoking within 1,000 feet of schools. While amendments were debated, he and a colleague stood next to the sponsor as they chomped on unlit cigars. In a better moment, he helped restore $1 million cut from the House budget for Dade's League Against Cancer. Then he and members of the Cuban Caucus argued over just who saved the day. Valdes' most memorable bill: He tried to regulate body-piercing, and tried to require kids to get parental approval before undergoing any piercing. It passed the House. But the Senate let it die.<ep>
