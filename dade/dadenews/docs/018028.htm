    Eighteen-year-old Carlos Zepeda dreams of earning ``big money,'' the kind that finances autos, homes and college educations.<P>

   But five days into his first job as a shipping clerk at a Hialeah mill shop, Zepeda makes only $4.25 an hour, the federal minimum wage. He's grateful for the opportunity, but well aware he's at the bottom rung of the economic ladder.<P>

    ``I'm patient though. It's not easy to find a job so I'm thankful for what I have,'' Zepeda said. ``But it must be hard for people with babies who have to buy diapers and stuff like that. And trying to pay bills? That's almost impossible.''<P>

   President Clinton, the working poor and some of the nation's leading economists agree. But a Democratic-led effort to bump the federal minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour over the next two years has touched off a fierce debate in Washington and the real world beyond, where employers like Paul DiMare say it will cost them big bucks.<P>

   As president of Homestead's largest commercial produce farm, DiMare employs hundreds of low-skilled immigrants at minimum wage to sort, grade and pack the company's multi-million pound vegetable harvest. Over the last six years, DiMare has cut back planting and employees due to increased competition from low-priced Mexican produce.<P>

   If the minimum wage increases, DiMare predicts more cuts and more low-skill agricultural jobs moving to Mexico where the labor costs are cheaper.<P>

   ``This is just another nail in the coffin,'' DiMare said of the wage increase. ``How can I compete with Mexico when they're paying $3 and $4 a day and I'm paying $5.15 an hour? To raise wages when we're struggling to survive is a bad idea.''<P>

   James Barthell, who works at a McDonald's restaurant in Hollywood, is one of about 11.8 million people who would receive a raise if the wage is increased. He takes a different view. ``It's a great idea,'' Barthell said, adding that people who oppose the increase need some empathy.<BR>
Support in the polls<P>

   ``They're not in our position, so it's easy for them to feel like that,'' Barthell said. ``If they were the ones in our situation they would be all for it.'' Public opinion polls show most Americans support the increase.<P>

   And Republican opposition, once strong and united, appears to be softening. On April 17, a group of Republican moderates even introduced a bill to raise the rate by a full $1. If authorizing legislation is passed, either as a stand-alone bill or an amendment to other proposals, Republicans are likely to try to attach financial provisions that help businesses create jobs as a way to offset any job losses the increase might bring.<P>

   It's unclear whether efforts by business lobbyists to derail the proposal will be successful.<BR>
Program began in 1938<P>

   Established in 1938 as a means to help low-income families, the minimum wage was first set at 25 cents an hour. It has been raised 17 times to keep pace with the cost of living. The last increase, from $3.80 an hour to the current $4.25 level, occurred in 1991.<P>

   But such labor economists as John Schmitt at the Economic Policy Institute point out that when adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage has fallen about 50 cents since it was increased in 1991. An increase to $5.15 would add another $36 a week or $1,872 annually, to the salary of a full-time employee making the minimum wage.<P>

   For people like Ernesto Rivas of Hialeah, that money makes a big difference. Rivas, a day laborer, earns just over minimum wage, working with construction crews and small contractors on a temporary, as-needed basis. His wife, Anna, does housekeeping part-time. Living with relatives allows them to stretch their money, but they often need small loans to hold them over until pay day. <BR>
No money for luxuries<P>

   Anything outside rent, food and clothing for themselves and their two daughters, is a luxury.<P>

   ``It's tough,'' Rivas said. ``With more money I could put food on the table, and pay rent. You can't do that on minimum wage. They should raise it.''<P>

   But Zepeda's boss, Lorraine Goldstein, owner of United Thread Mills in Hialeah, said minimum wage jobs weren't meant to support a family but rather to provide a foothold into the job market.<P>

   Of Goldstein's seven employees, only Zepeda earns the minimum wage. He stocks shelves, unloads delivery trucks and helps prepare for shipping the embroidered goods that the company sells throughout South America and the Caribbean.<P>

   Because the job is low-skilled and doesn't pay well, Goldstein was looking for a younger employee like Zepeda. ``Not a family man who has to support his children. I'm more reasonable than that,'' she said.<P>

   The Florida Department of Labor estimates that only 236,000 people, or 3.8 percent of the state's total 6.1 million work force, earn the minimum wage. And depending on which side you talk to, experts say a higher rate will either trigger job losses or have a minimal effect on the economy.<BR>
The economists' outlook<P>

   In a recent statement, 101 noted economists -- among them John Kenneth Galbreath and former Nobel Prize winners Kenneth Arrow of Stanford, Lawrence R. Klein of the University of Pennsylvania and James Tobin of Yale University -- issued a statement, supporting the increase. The scholars determined the effects of an increase ``on the labor market, affected workers, and the economy would be positive.''<P>

   But the conservative, industry-backed Employment Policies Institute, estimates the increase could mean the loss of 621,000 jobs in labor-intensive retail and service industries as owners cut hours and positions to offset the pay increases.<P>

   The National Restaurant Association estimates that 36% of the nation's minimum wage earners work in the food service area. John Soleo owns an International House of Pancakes Restaurant in Westchester. He said the only employees earning minimum wage are two high-school age dishwashers. He's more concerned about employees who make more than $5 and $6 an hour. If the minimum wage moves 90 cents closer to their pay level, they may also want a raise to keep their salaries competitive.<P>

   ``If you've been working here for a few years and you're making a dollar or so over minimum wage and all of a sudden, people we just hired are making almost the same amount of money, you're going to want more money,'' Soleo said. ``I can't afford to give increases across the board. That would be cost-prohibitive, so those employees who aren't happy are probably going to leave for something else. I'll lose an experienced employee and have to start with a trainee making the same wages who probably won't be as productive. That's the ripple effect you're going to have.''
