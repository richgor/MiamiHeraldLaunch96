   The phone calls start out innocently; a friendly hello from a relative or friend.<ep>
   They usually go like this: ``Guess who this is?''<ep>
   The person answers: ``Is this cousin so-and-so? You sound different.''<ep>
   From there, the caller has a field day: He explains how he just won a $45,000 legal settlement. His lawyer is leaving town for a funeral, and he needs help getting his windfall. To collect, he needs to pay a notary to sign documents.<ep>
   Then he asks for anywhere from $40 to $280. He promises money or a gift in addition to repayment.<ep>
   Police say that since July, at least 40 people have reported the scam to police, saying they forked over cash to someone they thought they knew. They appear to be victims of the same telephone con artist. He's made thousands in a scheme that starts at a phone linked to an Opa-locka city commissioner.<ep>
   ``He is multitalented,'' said David Hymes, the Metro-Dade detective investigating the case. ``He gets a lot of information from the people themselves. It's like the people are so taken in by the promise of money that they don't ask too many questions.''<ep>
   Dozens of victims called Metro-Dade police with the culprit's telephone number. It did not take long to track it: Some of them had Caller ID. <ep>
   Reports show the telephone number is registered to an Opa-locka city commissioner and her husband at a house they own in Liberty City.<ep>
   Commissioner Mary Allen, 69, said her son and daughter reside there and rent out rooms.<ep>
   ``I know it's not them,'' Allen said. ``There is a person living there they say is doing cons. But I don't go over there and tell him to stop doing it.''<ep>
   As for the victims, Allen says she has little pity. <ep>
   ``Victims?'' she said. ``That's somebody who's greedy, trying to get something for nothing. You don't see me getting conned, because I don't try to get something for nothing.''<ep>
   Police say they do not suspect Allen is involved in the scam.<ep>
   Meanwhile, reports are piling up all over the county, Hymes said.<ep>
   ``The calls are from anywhere from Flagler Street to County Line Road,'' Hymes said. ``These people are young, old, white, black, Latin. He's duped a schoolteacher, a foreman and a dock worker.''<ep>
   All of the victims reported being given a telephone number and asked to call a ``Reverend Mitchell'' to arrange a pickup of the money. All the meetings have taken place between Northwest 62nd and 70th Streets from 17th to 19th Avenues, in Liberty City (--) in the vicinity of the home owned by Allen.<ep>
   Hymes said it is not clear whether the same person who makes the calls is the one who picks up the cash. He said he has a good idea who the swindler is, but he has not made an arrest because he has been unable to gather the evidence for a felony charge.<ep>
   Police cannot tap telephone conversations, so they have not been able to officially link the calls to the home. The victims only see the ``Reverend'' for a few seconds, and most can't identify him. <ep>
   Others are so embarrassed that they don't want to press charges. <ep>
   ``They feel so foolish that they fell for the scam that they just want to put their heads between their legs and forget about it,'' Hymes said. ``How can I take a victim like that to testify in court?''<ep>
