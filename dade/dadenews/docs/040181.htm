<H2>ON THE WATER</H2>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Father drowns on lake outing with son</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->
    A father drowned Sunday evening while playing with his 12-year-old son in a West Kendall lake, police said.<P>

   The man, identified as Mufid Jabr, 38, of The Hammocks, was first reported missing about 8 p.m. at the man-made beach and lake at 9709 Hammocks Blvd. <P>

   ``He was playing with his kid near the buoy,'' said Rudy Espinosa, a Metro-Dade police spokesman. ``He went under for no apparent reason near a drop-off in the lake. According to responding officers, the family said he didn't know how to swim.''<P>

   Once he disappeared, his family could not locate him and they called for help.<P>

   Police divers and rescue workers searched for more than an hour in the dark before locating his body.

<H2>IN CUBA</H2>

<!-- end headlines -->
   Six Cuban migrants were repatriated to Bahi de Cabanas, Cuba, on Sunday, four days after being rescued from a sinking tugboat 54 miles southeast of Andros Island.<P>

   The migrants were spotted by a Coast Guard plane Thursday, said Petty Officer Scott Carr. The Coast Guard cutter Padre was dispatched to meet the 35-foot tugboat, where they gave the migrants food, water and medical attention.<P>

   ``They immediately took them on board when they saw the boat was taking on water,'' Carr said.<P>

   The rescue brings the total number of Cuban migrants rescued at sea to 95 this year, Carr said.

<!-- end headlines -->

   Two men, at least one with a gun, on Monday robbed the Mayor's jewelry store on Miracle Mile in Coral Gables and stole merchandise worth more than $20,000, police said.<P>

   The gunman whipped out a firearm when an employee was showing jewelry to a customer and stole several items. No one was injured during the incident.<P>

   The store manager would not comment.<P>

<H2>GOVERNMENT IN ACTION</H2>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Metro rescinds self-imposed port fine</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->

  When Dade County building officials discovered earlier this year that the Port of Miami had built two passenger terminals without proper building permits, the county fined itself $17,159 for violating the South Florida Building Code. But Port Director Carmen Lunetta won't have to pay.<P>

   Guillermo Olmedillo, acting director of Metro's Department of Planning Development and Regulation, said Monday he rescinded the fine after determining that former Metro building official Carlos Bonzon authorized the construction.<P>

   ``I couldn't very well go out and fine someone who had this verification,'' Olmedillo said.<P>

   The state Department of Business & Professional Regulation launched an investigation of the case in March. Olmedillo said he was interviewed last week by an investigator. Bonzon contends he acted within his authority.

<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>No plans to fill sinkhole</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->
   There were no immediate plans Monday to fill the Miramar sinkhole, as homeowners and developer Lennar reached a standoff on a plan to test for debris under homes.<P>

   A third plan of action submitted by Lennar late Friday still did not call for testing under every house in Hampshire Homes -- something homeowners are adamant about. They don't want the pit filled in until Lennar agrees to the testing.<P>

   The Department of Natural Resource Protection also found Lennar's latest plan lacked one detail: a record of how and when the garbage was buried on the site.<P>
