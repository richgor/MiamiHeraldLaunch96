<m0>   For much of the past decade, the Saldana brothers (--) Francisco, Jose and Henry (--) sold hundreds of pounds of cocaine from behind the barred windows and locked doors of their elderly grandmother's house in Miami's Design District.<ep>
   Now Henry Saldana is dead, shot in a drug-related homicide; the grandmother also has died, and Francisco and Jose face spending the rest of their lives in federal prison.<ep>
   The Saldanas were among eight members of an inner-city crack cocaine gang convicted by a federal jury Wednesday. Prosecutors said the group, called the Buena Vista Boys, locked members inside crack houses with guns and ordered them to distribute drugs through barred windows in a bid to prevent rip-offs.<ep>
   All the defendants were convicted on conspiracy charges. Additionally, Jose and Francisco Saldana were convicted of firearms violations, and Francisco Saldana was convicted under the federal ``drug kingpin'' statute.<ep>
   Police investigated the group for two years. They executed nine search warrants at various sites, seizing more than 20 firearms, $100,000 and crack-processing paraphernalia.<ep>
   Prosecutors said the main crack house was at 22 NE 43rd St., which belonged to Delia Varela, the Saldana brothers' 83-year-old grandmother.<ep>
   Varela went for groceries Feb. 20, 1995, and collapsed dead in the 4100 block of Northeast Second Avenue. Her body lay unclaimed in the Dade County morgue for 5 1/2 months before her grandsons saw a Herald article on unidentified cadavers and recognized one of them as their grandmother.<ep>
   Varela's body was held at the morgue at the same time her grandson Henry Saldana, 28, wound up there. He was shot to death July 28, 1995, in a drug-related homicide. One week later, the remaining Saldana brothers claimed their grandmother's body.<ep>
   Sentencing is pending for all those convicted. Besides the Saldana brothers, they are Andre Scales, Jesus Morejon, Quamil Haywood, Frederick Knight, David Velez and Stephen Harris.<ql>
