   By airboat and helicopter, rescuers searched the muck and shallow water of the Everglades, but they quickly stared at the grim reality: None of the 109 people on board a ValuJet DC-9 survived when their plane slammed into the earth west of Miami International Airport on Saturday.<P>

  ``Oh, no. Not the day before Mother's Day,'' said one frustrated Metro firefighter, pulling off his sweaty flame retardant gear.<P>

  The feeling of hopelessness struck even harder at families of the passengers:<P>

    ``There doesn't seem to be any hope,'' said Stewart P. Thomas of Coral Gables, whose daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter were on the plane. ``The screens on TV have gotten pretty close. I can't see any metal larger than a dishpan.''<P>

   Firefighters, paramedics and police officers -- who have trained for just such a tragedy -- could do little Saturday afternoon but slosh through the mud. At times, it seemed only the dragon flies and mosquitoes easily visited the wreckage.<P>

   Bodies were sighted, but fuel that could have been easily ignited and the natural terrain hampered rescue efforts to the point where even airboats were eventually prohibited from skimming the river of grass to help.<P>

  ``It is just all swamp and sawgrass. It will probably take three or four days to clean up. It will all have to be all done by airboat," said J.C. Esslinger, a state wildlife officer. ``It is going to be ugly out there. It's not going to be pleasant, that is for sure.''<P>

   ValuJet Flight 592 took off from Miami International at 2:05 p.m. -- one hour late -- with 104 passengers and a crew of five, said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Christy Williams.<P>

   It was scheduled to land one hour and 55 minutes later in Atlanta. Instead, after about 20 minutes, it bored into the ground like a power drill.<P>

   ``What we have is a high-impact crash,'' said a somber Luis Fernandez, spokesman for the Metro-Dade Fire Department.<P>

   The FAA's Williams gave this account of Flight 592's last minutes:<P>

   The DC-9 took off and had traveled less than 100 miles west of Miami, when the crew radioed Miami traffic controllers to report smoke billowing into the cockpit. The plane had been airborne eight minutes.<BR>
Headed back to airport<BR>
<P>

   The jet, then at an altitude of 10,500 feet, turned around and tried to make it back to Miami International.<P>

   At about 2:25 p.m., Miami air traffic control lost Flight 592 from its radar screens. The jet went down, apparently nose first, about 14 miles northwest of Miami International.<P>

    It disintegrated on impact in a desolate area of wet earth, grass patches and trees.<P>

   A private pilot from Miami Beach who was flying west at the time told Cable News Network he saw the plane go down. Daniel Muelhaupt said he was about two miles from the plane, flying toward Naples, when he saw what he at first thought was a small plane doing maneuvers. The craft was pointing down at an angle of about 75 degrees.<P>

   ``When it hit the ground, the water and dirt flew up,'' Muelhaupt said. ``The wreckage was like if you take your garbage and just throw it on the ground, it looked like that.''<P>

   Muelhaupt said he radioed authorities and circled until they reached the scene, which took a long time because there were no visible flames or large chunks of aircraft to focus on.<P>

   ``Access was a major, major problem. The plane was broken up into many pieces and submerged in 4 to 5 feet of water.'' said Metro-Dade's Fernandez.<BR>
Shredded metal and bodies<BR>
<P>

   Helicopters from the U.S. Coast Guard, Metro Police and the Dade fire department finally located the crash site and reported no signs of survivors, just minuscule pieces of shredded metal, baggage, bodies and a taut crater shaped like a candle flame. The crash sight is very close to where an Eastern Airlines L1011 crashed in 1972, the worst local air disaster before Saturday.<P>

    While rescuers searched in vain, distraught relatives of passengers rushed to the ValuJet counter at Miami International. Company officials quickly moved them to an auditorium, where counselors were available to help them deal with their loss.<P>

   Saturday afternoon, ValuJet's president spoke from Atlanta.<P>

   ``It's impossible to put into words how devastating something like this is,'' said Lewis Jordan, president and chief operating officer.<P>

   Atlanta-based ValuJet, which began operations in October 1993 and serves 26 cities in 17 states, has had a checkered past.<P>

    The airline has been one of the most successful startups in aviation history, but its rapid growth has been tainted by several accidents and questions about the reliability of its aged fleet.<P>

    The FAA has ValuJet under a special emphasis inspection because of repeated safety problems.<BR>
Special notice<BR>
<P>

    Last summer, the FAA issued a special inspection notice for aircraft engines that ValuJet purchased from a Turkish airline.<P>

   That investigation stemmed from a June 8, 1995, fire that destroyed a ValuJet DC-9 on a runway at Atlanta. One flight attendant was burned and minor injuries were reported as the 57 passengers and five crew were evacuated.<P>

    In January, a ValuJet DC-9 got stuck in the mud at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. The 101 passengers were bused to a terminal.<P>

   Also in January, another ValuJet DC-9 with 30 people aboard slid into a snowbank after landing at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, closing the airport for nearly three hours. No one was hurt.<P>

   A ValuJet DC-9 also skidded off an icy runway at Dulles in January 1994, closing the airport for almost two hours.<P>

   Flight 592 was a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 configured with 113 passenger seats. It is powered by Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines.<P>

   At the crash site, Metro fire and the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commision officers gathered about a half mile from the crash on the levy of the L-67 Canal. Helicopters landed on the ridge dropping off firefighters.<BR>
Possible<P>

   About 5:30 p.m., police and rescue were waiting for hazardous material specialists to check out the area before going in. There was concern about possible fuel leakage and explosion.<P>

   ``We have to wait until Haz Mat cleans it up, '' said E.M. Davis, a fresh water and game commission officer.<P>

   But as night came on, the search was called off. Rescue officials said the fuel atop the water posed too much of a risk for the airboats.<P>

   ``Night is falling, we're going to secure things here and make sure no one molests the area. We won't be going out there tonight,'' said Metro-Dade Police Capt. Rita Oramas.<BR>
