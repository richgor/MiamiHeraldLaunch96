    In a changing of Dade's educational guard, four top public school administrators are retiring this year, taking a century of expertise with them and another, more controversial asset: a total payout of $647,904 for unused sick and vacation days.<P>

   The four deputy superintendents are cashing a combined 1,226 unused days accrued during their long careers -- a benefit due them under district policy. Their nest eggs, which are in addition to their state retirement benefits, could pay 17 teachers for a year.<P>

   ``We're all for people deriving benefits, but you have to start taking a close look at what the impact is when you get this high,'' said Neil Crispo, a senior vice president with Florida TaxWatch, a Tallahassee group that has fought for stricter limits on administrator retirement packages.<P>

   The practice has long been a sore point between the public and private sectors, with critics calling the more outrageous examples of public cash-ins ``vacationgate'' and ``sickgate.''<P>

   The Los Angeles Unified School District allowed school administrators and other nonteachers to accrue $74 million in vacation pay, with $111,000 going to its superintendent when he left last year. When Broward Schools Superintendent Virgil Morgan retired two years ago, he took home $275,900 in sick and vacation time.<P>

   Dade's public schools have set aside almost $7 million to pay off this year's retirees for unused sick and vacation time.<P>

   Public outcry nationwide has grown as private employees have seen their vacation perks dwindle under ``use-it-or-lose-it'' policies.<P>

   More than half of all private-sector employees face losing their unused vacation time, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On top of that, downsizing and mergers often have kept busy private employees from using vacation time due them, further embittering them over the time banks allowed employees in the school and government ranks.<P>

   About 32 percent of American workers took half or less of their allotted vacation time in 1994, according to a recent poll by Strategic Consulting & Research in Irvine, Calif. About 11 percent took no vacation.<P>

   The time banks were created long ago as an incentive to teachers, so school systems wouldn't have to pay as much for substitutes. Florida TaxWatch and other critics argue administrators should have stricter limits on their unused time because the need for them is not as urgent.<P>

   The Florida Legislature last year capped the number of sick and vacation days school administrators could store. The new law -- which does not affect teachers -- limits administrators to cash in no more than 60 unused sick days and an equal number of unused vacation days.<P>

   But the law grandfathered in administrators hired before July 1, 1995, leaving unaffected Dade's deputy superintendents, along with thousands of other veteran bureaucrats statewide.<P>

   The administrators cash in their unused days at their current rate of pay. That means the deputy superintendents' payouts are based on their 1996 salaries, which amount to more than $120,000 each, instead of the teachers' salaries of less than $6,000 they earned in the 1950s and '60s, when some of the unused time was accrued.<P>

   School officials argue the stockpiling of unused days encourages employees to come to work, providing a better service to the public. It also enables school systems to attract top-notch educators, they contend.<P>

   ``The whole reason for this is not to frivolously rape the public coffers, it is to say, `We're going to reward people sufficiently so they will work and render service,' '' Dade Deputy Superintendent Thomas Cerra said.<P>

   Cerra, a lobbyist and union negotiator with 30 years in the Dade school system, will take home the largest payout of the four administrators -- $206,525 -- if he retires as planned in July.<P>

    He argues he's actually lost money because Dade caps the number of vacation days that can be cashed in at 62 1/2 and he's left far more vacation days unused.<P>

   Full-time school administrators in Dade get 12 sick and personal leave days and almost five weeks of paid vacation. Typical teachers, who work 10 months a year, get 10 sick days, but no paid vacation beyond holiday breaks.<P>

    The number of unused sick days that could be cashed in was unlimited before the state law passed last year, affecting new employees.<P>

   ``We're entitled to it,'' Cerra said. ``If you're sick and you use it, they lose your labor. If you're not sick, you give them your labor and you get the benefit when you retire. Either way, the public is getting its value out of that person.''<P>

   A move to end the grandfathering in of administrators hired before 1995 died in the Legislature this session amid legal concerns. <P>

   The critics want retirement payouts to at least be paid at the rate earned when the days were accumulated.<P>

   Public school teachers criticize large payments to school administrators. Still, their unions have joined the Florida Association of School Administrators in fighting caps on unused sick and vacation time cash-ins.<P>

   The unions fear cuts into the administrators' time could lead to similar limits on teachers, said Pat Tornillo, a leader for United Teachers of Dade, as well as the statewide Florida Education Association-United.<P>

   Tornillo argues the payouts to top-salaried school administrators are still far below what private corporate executives take when they retire with ``golden parachutes.'' <P>

   Until recently, a Dade school administrator who had worked more than 30 years could cash in unused sick time only at the pay rate earned at the 30-year mark. But the school system lifted its 30-year limit this year to encourage more longtime administrators to retire.<P>

   For Deputy Superintendent Angeline Welty, who retired in January, that meant she could cash in her 245 unused sick days at her 1996 pay rate -- $527.48 a day -- instead of the $230.64 a day she earned when she hit her 30 years of service in early 1983.<P>

   Her total take in sick pay: $129,232. In addition, she'll get $29,163 in vacation pay.<P>

   Metro-Dade government workers have similar time-bank arrangements.<P>

   Most Metro-Dade employees have their unused vacation payouts capped at 460 hours, or roughly 57 1/2 days, said Richard Freund, a director in the employee relations department.<P>

   The employees are limited to saving 1,000 unused sick hours, or 125 days, unless they've worked for the county 30 years or more. At that point, they can save an unlimited number of sick days and cash in upon retirement at their current rate of pay, Freund said.<P>

   Both the school system and the county call the practice sound because it keeps the wheels of government moving smoothly.<P>

   ``I believe that if they change this law anymore, people are simply going to use the days,'' said Deputy Superintendent Phyllis Cohen, who will cash in $105,899 in sick and vacation pay when she retires in July. ``They got continuity out of me. I didn't use the days. Now I'd like to be paid for them.''
