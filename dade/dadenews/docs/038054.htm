   Two TV crews waited outside his Tallahassee office for interviews; the phone rang endlessly; his daybook had him down for eight meetings; two state senators and the Senate president wanted to see him ``urgently,'' and several lobbyists and two needy families showed up unannounced.<P>

   For Mario Diaz-Balart, it was a typical day as chairman of the state Senate's Committee on Ways and Means, a day on which he would work up to 18 hours and dine at his desk on pizza and a chocolate milkshake.<P>

   The pressure was palpable. The fact that he had proposed an almost $300 million cut from the state budget for social services -- later reduced to $190 million in budget negotiations -- did not sit well with suppliers and recipients of those services. But the cut made it to the budget that was approved Saturday.<P>

   So much power in the hands of the youngest member of the Senate -- he is 34 -- has earned the senator both criticism and praise.<P>

   Daniella Levine, director of Dade County's Coalition for Social Services, charges that he has taken away money from those who need it most and who are most vulnerable, because they don't vote and lack political power.<P>

   And Gov. Lawton Chiles' representative in Dade, Joe Pena, said he ``greatly [regretted] that Diaz-Balart used his power to cut assistance to the needy.'' The cuts ``will affect many in this district,'' Pena said.<P>

   ``Yes, I know many people think I'm stingy,'' Diaz-Balart told a visitor last week. ``And it's true, because spending the money that others earn is a big responsibility.''<P>

   Besides, ``we can't manufacture money. We need to set priorities. We're doing whatever we can not to trim services that affect children and the elderly.''<P>

   But Eduardo Padron, president of Miami-Dade Community College, was pleased with the way Diaz-Balart handled the budget. His school will get a 7 percent increase in state funds. <P>

   ``He is a champion of education, one of the political leaders who best understands the relationship between community colleges and economic development,'' Padron said last week.<P>

   Diaz-Balart, who represents Dade's 37th District, has been a key figure in Republican ranks ever since the GOP gained a majority in the Senate in 1994. As chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, he has the final word on bills with fiscal import, to the extent that if he quashes one in the Senate, its House equivalent also dies.<P>

   Familiar with both chambers -- he was elected representative in 1984, senator in 1992 -- he describes himself as ``the Legislature's funnel.''<P>

   Senate President Jim Scott, who appointed Diaz-Balart to Ways and Means in 1995, says he has full confidence in his ability because ``he is one of the most brilliant lawmakers who have passed through the Senate in a long time.''<P>

   Diaz-Balart's legislative savvy goes back to his Cuban roots.<P>

   His grandfather, Rafael Jose, was a congressman and transport minister in Havana; his father, Rafael Lincoln, was undersecretary of the interior, congressman and senator in pre-Castro days.<P>

   The Diaz-Balarts left Cuba just before Christmas 1958. The two older sons -- Rafael, a banker, and Lincoln, the U.S. congressman -- were born in Cuba; the two younger -- Mario and Jose, a journalist -- were born in Fort Lauderdale.<P>

   Young Mario took his first steps in Spain, where the family lived for 12 years. And he took his first steps in Dade politics under the watchful eyes of Xavier Suarez who, while mayor of Miami, hired him as administrative assistant at the age of 23.<P>

   He didn't enter politics for the money, he said; he wanted to be a public servant. His $23,000-a-year salary as a legislator is little over a third of the $60,000 he earns as a vice president at the public relations firm of Gordon, Sloan and Diaz-Balart.<P>

   Sitting last week in the living room of his Westchester home, Diaz-Balart said he feels 100 percent Cuban -- and 100 percent American. He will go to a post-Castro Cuba to help in that nation's reconstruction, he vowed.<P>

   Right now, ``I have no time to think about starting a family, but that's my goal,'' said the bachelor.<P>

     The word in Tallahassee is that he has another goal: to become president of the Senate in 1998. It is a rumor he neither denies nor discourages.<P>

   ``He can achieve anything he sets his mind to,'' Scott said.
