   Taxpayers may pay $180,000 to a Metro-Dade police major who allegedly was caught with his pants down two years ago.<P>

   A Metro Commission committee on Monday recommended the legal settlement for Jesus Bencomo, who lost his rank of division chief following charges he had sex in his police car in the parking garage of Miami Children's Hospital.<P>

   Bencomo, who denies that ever happened, fought back by suing the police department. And he filed a federal case, alleging discrimination because he is Hispanic.<P>

   Metro police director Fred Taylor just wants to get rid of Bencomo. He says it's better to pay him the $180,000 now rather than drag the department through another two or three years of legal brawling and salary expense.<P>

   Now a major without an assignment, Bencomo is pulling down $93,908 per year. The proposed settlement allows Bencomo to retire at the rank of division chief.<P>

    It comes before the full Metro Commission today.<P>

   ``There are times to make statements about issues,'' Taylor said. ``To me, this is not one of those times. When I look at it, I'm frankly convinced we should part ways, pay the money and go on about our business.<P>

   ``Sometimes, you have to make a choice,'' Taylor said. ``You don't have to love it.''<P>

   Bencomo's lawyer, Jose ``Pepe'' Herrera, also says the settlement benefits everyone.<P>

   ``I think the potential for protracted, embarrassing litigation is only going to do more harm and cost everyone more,'' said Herrera.<P>

   Bencomo's would not be the only red face, Herrera said: ``I think there would be a lot of people who would be embarrassed by a lot of the things that would come out.'' He wouldn't give details.<P>

   A 28-year veteran, Bencomo started as patrolman and rose to the rank of division chief. He won high praise for overseeing South Dade after Hurricane Andrew.<P>

   His career took a bad turn on March 21, 1994. A security guard in the garage noticed a black Chevrolet with a man and woman inside. The car was rocking back and forth. He reported a possible rape.<P>

   An off-duty Metro detective peered in the window and saw a couple having sexual intercourse. The detective said he recognized the man as Bencomo.<P>

   Bencomo's version: he met a woman in white outside the hospital and offered her a ride to her car. They chatted for a while in his car in the parking garage. Then Bencomo dropped her off at the same spot he met her. He says he never even learned her name.<P>

   A Metro police review panel didn't buy that account, sustaining charges of conduct unbecoming an officer and using a county vehicle for ``personal business.''<P>

   In December 1994, Taylor demoted Bencomo.<P>

   Taylor said Bencomo's not helping the department any now. By dragging the case out, he said, taxpayers could ultimately pay $500,000 in salary and legal benefits.<P>

   ``It's like you have a bad marriage,'' Taylor said on Monday. ``You cut your losses and move on.''<P>

   Metro Commissioners Bruce Kaplan, Gwen Margolis and Javier Souto all agreed to send the settlement to their colleagues with a positive recommendation.<P>

   ``Boy, this one really sticks in my craw,'' Kaplan said.
