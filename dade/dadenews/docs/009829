    They came to Miami International Airport with a question they were afraid to have answered.<ep>
    Carrying babies and even herding dogs on leashes (--) their stoicism belying the chaos that suddenly had beset their lives (--) friends and relatives of some of the passengers aboard ValuJet Flight 592 were quickly ushered past the ticket counter Saturday afternoon by Metro-Dade police and airport personnel.<ep>
    Often walking arm in arm, finding strength in groups of three and four, they were led up back stairs seldom seen by travelers and ushered into a third-floor auditorium on Concourse B that in times such as these becomes the airport's crisis center.<ep>
  ``Please, my husband was on that plane. Please, my husband was on that plane,'' one woman repeated time and time again.<ep>
   A ValuJet employee (--) a woman who has been with the airline for only a month (--) waited just inside the auditorium door with the DC-9's passenger list. Some people would go no farther.<ep>
   ``They told us he was on the plane,'' Barbara Varcelo cried out as she and her mother spun around just inside the door. ``But they haven't told us anything.''<ep>
   Barbara Varcelo's grandfather, Alberto Varcelo, 60, of Hialeah, had been flying to Atlanta.<ql>
<m0>Counselors on hand<ep>
<m0>   Metro-Dade police crisis counselors and volunteers from the American Red Cross and Salvation Army awaited family members inside. They could offer coffee, soft drinks, sandwiches and cookies, and a bank of phones (--) but little the families could really use.<ep>
   ``The material things are being taken care of,'' said Metro-Dade Fire Rescue Capt. Allen Brown. ``They have food, diapers for the babies.<ep>
   ``They need information. They want to grieve, and that's what they're doing.''<ep>
   Alicia Marquez, an airport spokeswoman, could do nothing more than watch as a man in his 50s learned that his wife had been aboard the plane.<ep>
   ``He was openly crying,'' Marquez said.<ql>
<m0>Hope would fade<ep>
<m0>    A couple of dozen people waited for any glimmer of hope they sensed would never come.<ep>
    ``We saw the pictures on television,'' one man said. ``We know there's no hope.''<ep>
    There was no television in the crisis room.<ql>
