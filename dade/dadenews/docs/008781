   In a corner of northeast Miami's Design District, home to the Florida Museum of Hispanic and Latin American Art, Argentine artist Karina Chechik tucks red curls behind her ears and calls for the lights.<ql>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   In seconds, a show of light and shadows puts the finishing touches on Chechik's seven-painting series <m0>Labyrinths, <m0>an homage to the writings of Jorge Luis Borges, Argentina's famous wordsmith and storyteller.<ep>
   The powerful work of the young artist, a newcomer to Miami, will go on display today, along with that of 40 others from Argentina, as South Florida's new and old Argentine residents kick off a monthlong celebration of their culture.<ep>
    ``Miami is the capital Latin America itself doesn't have. Here, you are exposed to the influence of cultures from everywhere,'' Chechik says of her decision to move from Buenos Aires a year ago. ``This is a very interesting place to be.''<ep>
   The area's Argentine community has grown substantially in the '90s as more Argentines looking for business opportunities abroad find Miami's multicultural environment appealing. Official figures are not available because the U.S. Census doesn't break down all nationalities of Hispanics. But the Argentine Consulate in Miami counts a population of about 14,000.<ep>
   Many have moved here from New York and other large American cities where they first settled after fleeing the military dictatorships of the '70s, and later, the economic upheavals of the '80s.<ep>
   Many divide their time between homes in Miami and Buenos Aires. The ties to the homeland are never severed, they say.<ql>

<m0>   Chechik is opening a studio at the South Florida Art Center on Lincoln Road in Miami Beach but travels home as often as she can, ``limited only by the expense,'' she says. Likewise, Perez Celis, a well-known painter, has opened a major working studio off the Palmetto Expressway and Bird Road. And novelist Luisa Valenzuela, who recently bought an apartment in Miami Beach, finds Miami the perfect jumping off point for her worldwide travels.<ep>
   It is a community with enormous interest in the arts, says Raul M. Oyuela, the Argentine director of the Hispanic art museum, which is hosting most of the Argentine Cultural Month activities.<ep>
   ``I saw an opportunity to make a contribution here,'' Oyuela said of his move here from San Francisco in 1990. ``Miami's image of palm trees and Miami vice is changing. It is being replaced by one of a place that has a growing cultural awareness. We're not there yet, but the opportunities are phenomenal.''<ep>
   Oyuela left Argentina in 1978 in the midst of the turbulent years of military dictatorship and lived in Spain for 12 years before coming to the United States. ``Argentines have always been world travelers. We are a nation of immigrants, just like this country, so we feel very much at home here,'' Oyuela said.<ep>
   When he started putting on the festival, which the museum is cosponsoring with the Consulate General of Argentina, Oyuela found no shortage of experts on Argentine culture.<ep>
   Miguel Arrabal, ``one of the best <m0>bandoneon<m0>  players,'' lives in Miami. He will play the accordionlike instrument used especially for tangos at the museum Saturday. Another expert, Luis Rivera, will discuss the music's roots. And Oyuela will lecture on Borges, the writer, with Chechik's dramatic display as a backdrop.<ep>
