   The chain letters of childhood have grown up.<P>

   The letters that dared you to keep the chain going or risk bad luck have evolved into an inexpensive and illegal pyramid scheme. Delivered by mail and electronically, the pitch is a surreal translation of capitalism: Mail $5, make $50,000.<P>

   Chain letters -- a perennial thorn in the side of postal authorities -- are making a comeback in Florida, consumer officials say.<P>

   ``What we received in the mail as children was mischievous, but not illegal. Now with money involved, even if it's a small amount, chain letters have been bumped into the scam department,'' said Jody Collins, an assistant attorney general.<P>

   Chain letters are illegal if they request money or other items of value and promise participants a return. Federal postal authorities can prosecute under lottery and mail fraud laws. Florida officials treat chain letters as an illegal lottery or a deceptive business practice.<P>

   Typically, a chain letter requires you to send money to five people on a list. Then, you scratch off the name at the top and add yours to the bottom, reproduce the letter,with your name in the sixth position, and mail copies to other people. The number of chain letters mushrooms, your name moves up the list, and people send you money.<P>

   In some of the letters, consumers are told to buy a mailing list which ranges from $10 to $100. <P>

   In theory, chain letters work. If everyone who receives the letter mails out copies to five people, and those people send out copies, the number of participants would expand exponentially. Thirteen mailings would generate 13,060,694,016 participants. A few mailings later, and the number of shady pen pals would exceed the U.S. population.<P>

   Scammers make their money by selling the mailing lists or providing fictitious names in the letters. Consumers end up sending the money to the same address or post office box.<P>

   And though the letters are touted as a legal business opportunity, would-be investors are warned not to include their return address.<P>

   Any Florida resident with a mailbox or computer may have heard from Dave or David Rhodes. He says in 1991 he was broke. He had been laid off and his car repossessed. <P>

   ``In October, 1991, I received a letter in the mail telling me how to earn $50,000 any time I wanted to. Of course I was skeptical, but I was desperate and had nothing to lose. So, I gave it a try -- today I am rich!!,'' the letter reads.
