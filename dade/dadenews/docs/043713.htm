   Yolanda Pruneda stared with amazement as the price on the gas pump at a Coconut Grove Shell station kept climbing.<P>

   ``My God,'' gasped Pruneda, holding her face with both hands. ``It's already over 50 dollars. I can't believe it.''<P>

   Pruneda, a Homestead resident, was pumping premium grade gas into one of those gas-guzzling light trucks popular in suburbia.<P>

 She was one of about two dozen South Florida commuters who shared stories about how they're dealing with the nationwide gas price hike of 1996.<P>

   From Florida City to Boca Raton, commuters are coping. They say they're driving less, car-pooling more or switching to other modes of transportation -- even bicycles.<P>

   ``A couple of times last week, I car-pooled into the office with co-workers,'' Pruneda said as she pumped gas into a large white Chevrolet Suburban. ``I think twice before I get into my vehicle to go run an errand. Before, I would just do it.''<P>

   Ditto for Robert Bobyack, a salesman filling his white Mazda's tank at a Chevron station in Boca Raton.<P>

   ``I'm doing more work on the phone these days,'' Bobyack said. ``I'm trying to cut down on my driving. I do more planning ahead before I get into the car. I try to combine trips.''<P>

   One long-distance commuter, a man who drives once a week between Miami and St. Petersburg, said he's going to start taking the plane because flying may be cheaper.<P>

   ``With high gas prices and tolls and wear and tear on the car, I estimate it costs me about $50 or $55 per trip in the car,'' said Armand Melanson, a casino boat slot machine technician. ``Flying costs $54, and I save on the wear and tear on the car.''<P>

 Joann Heabert, a social worker, also decided to leave her car at home.<P>

  ``She's biking to work,'' said Paul Heabert, her husband, who was filling up at a Shell station for a holiday road trip. ``But she doesn't work that far from home.''<P>

   And he hasn't changed his driving habits and is betting he won't have to.<P>

   ``I think prices eventually will drop,'' Heabert said.<P>

   Other drivers weren't as casual about the price jump.<P>

   Miriam Ortiz, a student counselor in Miami Beach, has switched to a lower grade of gas.<P>

   Switching to regular grade is actually recommended by the American Automobile Association Clubs of Florida.<P>

   ``Don't buy premium grade gasoline if your car doesn't need it,'' AAA said in a statement last week. ``The majority of cars are engineered to run on regular [87 octane] gasoline. Motorists who aren't sure of whether their cars need premium grade gasoline should check their owner's manual.''<P>

   While most commuters expressed anger, dismay or shock at the prices, a few dismissed the concern as premature or misplaced.<P>

   ``Yes, there is a gas price increase, but it's not cause for alarm,'' said Placido Herrera, a Coconut Creek resident who commutes to Broward Boulevard.<P>

   ``People forget that only a few years ago, we were paying really high prices for gas,'' Herrera said.<P>

   He's right. Herrera paid $1.49 one day last week for a gallon of premium grade gas for his shiny red Dodge Stealth at a Citgo station at the Florida's Turnpike Pompano Beach service plaza.<P>

   That may be the highest price since the Persian Gulf War five years ago. But it pales with the more than $2, adjusted for inflation and taxes, that stations charged between 1980 and 1982.<P>

   Unadjusted, gas prices today are still lower than in the 1980s. Florida's average price for self-serve unleaded rose last week 11.1 cents to $1.26 a gallon. In March 1981, the U.S. city average price of regular unleaded stood at $1.41 a gallon.<P>

   Herrera has no plans to drive less.<P>

   ``When you gotta travel, you gotta travel,'' he said. ``Gas prices are like milk prices. You pay them because you have to drink it.''<BR>
