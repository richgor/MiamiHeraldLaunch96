<m0>   A puny and remorseful 11-year-old residing at Dade's Juvenile Justice Center holds an ominous distinction: He's among the youngest in the county ever to be charged with murder.<ep>
   It seems the boy didn't appreciate the fun his 9-year-old cousin Khadejah Bolden and her friend were having Tuesday night over his clothes. His alleged comeback to the ridicule: He went inside the home at 2115 NW 193rd Terr., got a shotgun, and used it to shoot Khadejah in the head. <ep>
   ``Apparently they were teasing <m4>Khadejah<m2><ql>
<m0>this 11-year-old boy and he became upset,'' said Metro-Dade police spokesman Mike McDonald. ``He came out with a .22-caliber rifle. The kids started laughing at him even more because they knew this particular weapon didn't work. He went back inside and came back with a shotgun. He distinctly points it at the little girl, discharging it, striking her in the head.''<ep>
   Now Khadejah is dead, and her cousin is in big trouble.<ep>
   Police charged him with second-degree murder, an offense that if committed by an adult can result in life behind bars. Chances are slim that he will be tried as an adult, because there are few places to house or treat someone that young. Tried as a juvenile, he probably would be free by his 19th birthday.<ep>
   ``Homicide [detectives] felt this was somewhere between premeditated murder and an accident,'' McDonald said. ``They felt second-degree murder was the appropriate charge.'' <ep>
   Sources said the boy spent his first day in detention bawling.<ep>
   Prosecutors are also thinking about charging Khadejah's grandfather,John Bolden, 62, with culpable negligence because he left a loaded shotgun within reach of youngsters. The rarely used law is a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison.<ep>
   Only 10 people have been charged since the law was enacted in 1989.<ep>
   Police said there were no adults home at the time of the shooting. Bolden had gone fishing. A 15-year-old boy was left in charge.<ep>
   Bolden said that until Tuesday night the kids never touched the shotgun, which was kept behind the couch. Police confiscated two shotguns, a handgun, and the broken rifle at the home. Sources said the weapons were usually kept in the attic, but were moved behind the couch because the repairs are being made to the roof. <ep>
   ``He got in his mind to get the gun at her,'' Bolden told WFOR-Channel 4. ``He couldn't handle her. She was like a tomboy. Anytime he jumped on her, she'd mostly beat him. So I guess he decided to get the gun and shoot her.''<ep>
   Other family members were enraged at the notion that the boy and the grandfather would face charges for what they deemed an accident.<ep>
   ``Even if he accidentally pulled the trigger, he's going to be held responsible,'' said Metro-Dade homicide detective Gus Bayas. ``He's only 11 years old; it's hard to believe he <m0>wanted<m0> to do something like this.''<ep>
   Bayas said the 11-year-old, whose name was withheld, told police the whole story. He said he didn't mean it. His true intention: to frighten the girls.<ep>
    ``He spilled it all out,'' Bayas said. ``He explained it in a fashion that sounded believable. He definitely made it sound like he didn't mean to do it. He felt that pointing a shotgun would intimidate them.''<ep>
   After the killing, the 15-year-old boy and two girls, age 3 and 6, were removed from the home and placed in the custody of an aunt. Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services spokeswoman Beverly Counts-Rodrigues said the children (--) the victim's two siblings and a cousin (--) will remain there until the agency investigates ``neglect issues'' in the home. <ep>
   Police said they called HRS because there was trash, dirty clothes, and dog feces about the house.<ep>
   ``I am told the condition of the house was deplorable,'' Bayas said. ``It was a bad condition for children, or anybody else for that matter.'' <ep>
   Bayas said the Boldens are raising the 11-year-old suspect because his mother is dead and his father, who is related to the Boldens, is rarely around.<ep>
   The boy joins the ranks of Dade's other prepubescents accused of murder: a 10-year-old charged with manslaughter and two 12-year-olds accused of first-degree murder. All the cases involved guns.<ep>
   Prosecutors tried one of the 12-year-olds as an adult. He was convicted and sentenced to long-term hospitalization. The other two cases were closed at the juvenile level.<ep>
   ``He's definitely one of the youngest kids charged with a homicide in Dade county,'' said Leon Botkin, Dade's chief juvenile prosecutor.<ep>
   Botkin's office wall is lined with newspaper clippings of gun-related deaths involving children. <ep>
   ``Guns and kids don't belong together,'' Botkin said. ``Too many kids have access to guns. If the gun is not there, the worst that can happen is you find a pot, a pan or a knife but you still have to chase someone. With a gun, you just stand there and shoot.''<ep>
