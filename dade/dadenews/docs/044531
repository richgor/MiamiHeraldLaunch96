   A year ago, Cuban refugee Antonio Coipel stepped off a Venezuelan jetliner at Miami International Airport with two companions, seeking asylum like so many before them.<ep>
   The two friends who fled Cuba with Coipel are now free, one after winning political asylum early and the other after a prolonged court and publicity battle that ended in March.<ep>
   But Coipel (--) who narrowly avoided deportation to Venezuela when he refused to board a waiting plane (--) marked a gloomy one-year anniversary in detention Thursday at the Broward County Jail.<ep>
   The government can't try to expel him again for now, because Coipel won an order from a federal judge barring deportation while his case is on appeal.<ep>
   But Coipel, 28, finds himself in a legal tussle that shows no sign of ending soon.<ep>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service, alleging Coipel used false documents and lied about it, wants him expelled to Venezuela (--) a rare move that would be sure to provoke controversy in Miami's exile community.<ep>
   Coipel, who is charged with no crime, says he is anxious because he is surrounded by violent ex-felons who steal his food and start fights. Too frightened to go to the yard for weekly exercise breaks, he spends his time in his cell, reading and trying to teach himself English. Recently, he said, guards confiscated metal objects that could be used as weapons from his cell mates.<ep>
   ``I can't take it anymore,'' Coipel said in a phone interview from the jail. ``I have spent two months here not knowing if it's sunny or raining outside. I thought I was coming to a free country, and I find myself in a prison. Sometimes I feel terribly depressed.''<ep>
   His attorney, Henry Marinello, contends the U.S. government is trying to intimidate his client.<ep>
   ``They're doing this as a show of force,'' Marinello said. ``It's unbelievable. He could easily be in a county detention center for another three to four months with common criminals.''<ep>
   The INS says Coipel, who was previously held at the agency's Krome Detention Center in West Dade, was sent to the Broward jail for refusing to get on a plane to Venezuela in March. Though he did not physically resist boarding the flight, detainees who refuse deportation are put in jail for ``security reasons,'' said INS spokesman Lemar Wooley.<ep>
   Wooley said INS officials would ``look into'' whether criminals are being held with Coipel.<ep>
   Though INS rules bar mixing immigration detainees with regular prisoners, Marinello said, the ex-felons who share Coipel's cell are not considered criminals by the agency because they have served their sentences. The ex-felons are awaiting hearings to determine whether they should be released or deported.<ep>
   But they still represent a danger to his client, said Marinello, who wants Coipel transferred back to Krome. <m1><ep>
<m0>   The INS's attempt to deport Coipel came one week after his family friend and traveling companion Elizabeth Pis was released to the custody of her husband, a legal resident here. She was freed when an immigration judge, agreeing to take another look at her case, lifted a deportation order against her.<ep>
   The INS has declined to release Coipel on parole, however, because he was refused asylum by an immigration judge and because he has no immediate relatives in the country.The Board of Immigration Appeals in Virginia is now considering whether to reopen his asylum case.<ep>
   If returned to Venezuela, Coipel fears he will be sent back to Cuba, where he was jailed for two years for trying to leave the country without authorization.<ep>
   ``I'm very afraid,'' he said. ``If I go back to Cuba, I may never see the light of day again.''<ql>
