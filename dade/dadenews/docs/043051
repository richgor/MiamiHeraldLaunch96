   As the Allapattah Middle School drill team danced to its band's beat Saturday at the Arabian Nights Festival in Opa-locka, Monica Patterson, 13, and her 9-year-old sister Lory admired their moves.<ep>
   ``Those boys dancing over there look <m0>fine<m0>,'' said Lory, who lives just blocks away from the parade route. Each year, the parade gives the sisters new ideas for elastic dance steps as performed by the young cheerleaders and majorettes.<ep>
   Since 1926, the Arabian Nights Festival has been an annual highlight in Opa-locka. Families and friends line the sidewalks under shady spots to see glittery floats pass by and hear the powerful pulse of local school bands' signature drums. The event is themed after the area's historic Moorish backdrop, inspired by the novel for which the festival is named.<ep>
   This year, more than 3,000 students from 24 Dade County public schools marched in the parade. School Board member Frederica Wilson, honorary chairwoman of the event, said it's a perfect way to teach the children to be civic-minded.<ep>
   ``It's important to get them to participate, because there are so many kids out there involved in activities that aren't wholesome,'' Wilson said. ``This is a way to get them involved in positive, family-oriented activities. It makes them feel like a part of the community and makes them future builders of the community.''<ep>
   On Friday night, Opa-locka Vice Mayor Helen Miller was saluted for her 15 years of public service and honored as a legend for being the first black female mayor in Dade County and the state.<ep>
   ``I feel honored, pleased and proud to be part of this year's festival,'' said Miller, an Opa-locka resident for 46 years. ``And it's the biggest and best one I've ever seen.''<ep>
   Ildelisa Royero makes a point to be there. She didn't bother to make her bed Saturday morning. She didn't even keep her appointment at the beauty salon. She just quickly wrapped her short, graying hair into curlers and sprinted to her front yard overlooking Opa-locka Boulevard to join her husband Ramon and their Chihuahua, Peewee.<ep>
   ``We never miss this event,'' said Royero, 69, an Opa-locka resident for more than three decades. ``Ramon and Peewee were parked out here since early in the morning just to get a good view.''<ep>
