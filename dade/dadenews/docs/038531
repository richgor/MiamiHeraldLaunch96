<m0>   Metro-Dade police cadet Juan Suarez, who once planned to put criminals behind bars, is going to prison.<ep>
   After deliberating about six hours, a jury convicted him Tuesday afternoon of robbery and burglary. He faces a likely sentence of three to five years in prison, although Dade Circuit Judge Martin Kahn could sentence him to life.<ep>
   Suarez, 25, lowered his head in disbelief as the jury verdict was read. Hours earlier, he testified that he never aimed a shotgun at a night watchman last year or stole his white 1988 Ford Mustang convertible, which had been repossessed.<ep>
   ``It's a shame,'' said prosecutor PercyMartinez. ``This young man destroyed a promising career.''<ep>
   Suarez was 10 days shy of graduating from the police academy, which lasts nine months, when he was arrested.<ep>
   On Monday, Miami detective Rudy Herrera told jurors that the defendant ``loved his car,'' and that is why he stole it from the repo yard Sept. 10.<ep>
   But Suarez and his lawyer, Michael Voigt, challenged that assertion. Suarez said he was not infatuated with the Mustang. He merely ``loved all sports cars.''<ep>
   They also challenged the credibility of the state's star witness, Manuel Medina, the watchman who testified that Suarez pointed a shotgun at him to steal the car. Voigt told jurors that Medina suffers from psychiatric problems, takes Zanax for anxiety and needed a magnifying glass to identify his client.<ep>
