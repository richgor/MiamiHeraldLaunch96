<ep>
<m0>   Federal prosecutors have announced that a grand jury indicted two Bahamian nationals on charges that they smuggled almost 3,000 Cuban stogies into Miami through <m0>Miami International Airport.<m0><ep>
   Philip King, 28, and Juanita Saunders, 29, allegedly bought the cigars in Cuba and funneled them through the Bahamas before bringing them to Miami in their luggage.<ep>
   Once here, over several days at the end of last month, King and Saunders allegedly sold some of their cigars, which cannot be legally sold in the United States because of the trade embargo with Cuba.<ep>
   But before the accused smugglers could clear out their inventory, a tip led law enforcement agents to a Miami hotel, where the pair allegedly was found with 114 boxes of cigars worth thousands of dollars.<ep>
   King and Saunders have been charged with conspiracy, smuggling and making false statements on Customs declarations and each face a maximum of five years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 if convicted.<ql>
