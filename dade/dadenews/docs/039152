<m0>   Roberto Martin Cabrera's conscience wouldn't leave him in peace. One week ago, he unburdened himself: The government of Cuba, he told Miami police and federal agents, had ordered him to carry out three assassinations.<ep>
   The order to act came to him in a colorful thank-you card, he said. ``Prepare the music for the electric gourd,'' the message read.<ep>
   Translation: Prepare the explosives for the attempt on the Cuban American National Foundation offices.<ep>
   ``We believe that he is a spy,'' said Miami Police Chief Donald Warshaw on Monday. ``He has given us credible information, which we have been able to verify.''<ep>
   News of the terrorist plan was announced Monday afternoon at the CANF headquarters by foundation officials.<ep>
   On April 29, police said, Martin appeared at the foundation's headquarters to say he had orders to kill three of its leaders: board Chairman Jorge Mas Canosa, President Francisco ``Pepe'' Hernandez and Ninoska Perez, director of the radio station La Voz de la Fundacion, which broadcasts to Cuba.<ep>
   Martin also had instructions to blow up the foundation's building, at 7300 NW 35th Ter., with a van filled with explosives, police said.<ep>
   ``In view of the available evidence, we are taking this seriously. But it's nothing new,'' Mas Canosa said during a news conference Monday at foundation headquarters. ``We're under constant threat because we're facing a killer,'' he added, alluding to President Fidel Castro.<ep>
   The foundation contacted Miami police, which took over the case at once. It also contacted the FBI, with whom Martin said he had collaborated as an informer since May 1995. But the FBI has refused to discuss the topic.<ep>
      Martin left Cuba on a raft in August 1994. He was picked up in the Florida Straits by a Coast Guard vessel and taken to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. <m1><ep>
<m0>   The following is Martin's account, as told to the police and described during the press conference:<ep>
   In May 1993, Martin was arrested by Cuban border guards while attempting to flee the country. <m1> <m0>While at Villa Marista, headquarters of State Security, a man who identified himself as Lt. Hiram Bejerano offered him freedom in exchange for collaboration.<ep>
   After being trained as a spy, Martin was told that two Interior Ministry officials named ``Jorge'' and ``Danilo'' would be his permanent contacts. His first assignment would be in the United States, he was told.<ep>
   Cuban agents placed Martin and his father-in-law, Julio Cannet, aboard a raft and put them to sea. Martin's wife and children remained on the island.<ep>
   In January 1995, Martin contacted Havana. On May 27, 1995, he traveled to New York City and contacted a Cuban individual who handed him a set of orders written in code.<ep>
   Back in Miami, Martin decided not to follow the orders. He visited radio personality Tomas Garcia Fuste at WCMQ (1210 AM) and sought his counsel. Days later, he was contacted by two FBI agents who identified themselves as ``Angel'' and ``Mario.''<ep>
   To them, Martin delivered the documents he received in New York City and a recording he had made of his telephone conversation in January with his superiors in Havana.<ep>
The agents gave Martin their beeper number and designated him as ``agent Robalo,'' the Spanish word for sea-bass.<ep>
   From that moment on, Martin stayed in touch with the Cuban government and<m0> <m0>the FBI. On Sept. 30, 1995, he returned to New York City to get further instructions from his Cuban handlers. Concealed in his jacket was a microphone provided by the FBI.<ep>
   In February, two Cuban agents (--) ``Osmel'' and ``Cartaya'' (--) contacted Martin in Hialeah and told him the foundation had to be destroyed. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``We were able to verify much of the information and believe that what he says is true,'' said Maj. Miguel Exposito of the Miami police. <m1><ep>
<m0>   During eight hours of interrogation, Martin's story remained consistent, Warshaw said, ``and that confirms to us that he is credible.'' <m1><ep>
<m0>   Martin is under police protection, not under arrest, Warshaw said. ``We're concerned about his safety and so is he. We have no reason to arrest him.''<ep>
   The intended victims are also under police protection.<ep>
   ``We still feel threatened,'' Hernandez said. Martin ``is just one of three or four people who were going to carry out this [assassination] mission. We have not identified the others.''<ep>
