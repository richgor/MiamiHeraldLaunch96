<m0>   So long as he had a waterfront nearby and work on a house or a boat awaiting him, Bobby Paul would go almost anywhere.<ep>
   A self-made shipwright, Paul parlayed his passion for rebuilding boats into a buoyant, busy career wherever he went.<ep>
   For more than a decade, his home was Miami, where he lived at Dinner Key Marina and in Coconut Grove, and where he worked as a marine carpenter and a yacht captain. <ep>
   His latest stop was St. Petersburg, where he moved five years ago with his wife, former Herald library director Nora Paul. There, he was the sole proprietor of Bayou Boatworks.<ep>
   Injured in a motorcycle accident last week, Paul died Thursday at Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg. He was 50.<ep>
   ``He was truly a self-taught jack-of-all-trades who could really see all sorts of interesting things to be done with almost anything that he saw,'' his brother-in-law, Herald Associate Editor Stephen K. Doig, recalled Saturday.<ep>
   Paul practiced much of his craftsmanship in the four-car garage that he added onto his family's St. Petersburg home. <ep>
   ``Bobby was great for buying something and putting a few months' work into it and selling it for 20 times the amount he had paid,'' Doig said.<ep>
   Born Aug. 3, 1945, in New York City, Robert Nathan Paul was raised in Houston, where he met his future wife, a research librarian.<ep>
   They moved to Miami more than 15 years ago, when Nora came to work for The Herald. They were married a short time later at a family gathering in Tallahassee at Christmas. <m1><ep>
<m0>   As his wife took research technology to new heights at The Herald, Paul rebuilt and restored boats at Merrill Stevens Dry Dock in Miami, where he was an accomplished marine carpenter.<ep>
   In the course of his work there, Paul met restaurateur Monty Trainer and later became the captain of Trainer's yacht.<ep>
   Five years ago, his wife, by then an international expert in news and computer research, was offered a prestigious position at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg. Paul was game to go.<ep>
   ``Bobby was happy to go off to another adventure,'' Doig recalled.<ep>
   Besides his wife, Paul is survived by his sons, Nathan, 11, and Spencer, 9; his daughter from an earlier marriage, Mercedes Paul; his mother, Ann Paul of St. Helena, Calif.; and his sisters, Patricia Perini, also of St. Helena, and Elizabeth Avedon of New York.<ep>
   The family will hold a memorial celebration today in the Bahama Shores Drive South Park on the bay in St. Petersburg. Donations can be sent to the AIDS Coalition, 1180 Cleveland St., Clearwater, Fla. 34615.<ep>
