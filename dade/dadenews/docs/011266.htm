   After a day of conducting ultrasounds, MRIs and other high-tech medical tests, Dr. Pamela Dickson is ready for a dose of carrot juice in a store that sells organic mushrooms, wheat-free macaroni and the book Natural Healing with Herbs.  <P>

   Like an increasing number of South Floridians, Dickson, a radiologist, is seeking a blend -- and balance -- between a fast, high-tech society and a simpler, more natural life.<P>

   As the dawn of a new millennium approaches, many are seeking out natural foods and remedies, from organic tomatoes to herbs that treat insomnia. <P>

   A movement with roots in the West Coast, where organic gardening and herbal medicine has flourished for decades, New Age shops, restaurants and bookstores have arrived in South Florida, cropping up from South Beach to Coconut Grove to Fort Lauderdale.<P>

   Even established area bookstores are following the trend with sections devoted to natural healing, organic gardening and New Age philosophy.<BR>
   The Natural Food Market, with a medicinal herb section, has stores in Kendall and South Beach. Fort Lauderdale's I am VEGAN delivers spinach lasagna, broccoli barley soup and vanilla cocoa cake from North Dade to Boca Raton -- and is swamped with orders.<P>

   The Olde Grove Market and Juice Bar opened five months ago at 2806 Bird Ave. with a natural foods deli, an organic-produce counter, a homeopathic medicinal section and a frozen-foods department that carries organically grown tofu vegetable lasagna.<P>

   It offers sunflowers -- as well as natural remedies for arthritis, boxes of Japanese macaroni and jars of fat-free organic tomato and mushroom pasta sauce. And the Olde Grove delivers lunches to harried workers, from Coral Gables to Brickell.<P>

   It is a place Dickson finds homey, friendly -- and necessary.<P>

   ``I'm trying to live my life as healthy as possible,'' she said. ``I'm always looking for clean food.'' <P>

   On Sunday, she ate lunch at the Olde Grove Market with a friend, screenwriter Corinne Donner, while chatting with one of the owners, Rudy A&ntilde;ez, who calls himself a ``retired'' engineer.<BR>
   Tired of 14-hour days and projects that seemed all too similar, A&ntilde;ez quit to start the Olde Grove Market with his best friend, Luis Valeiras, and Valeiras' fiancee, Maura Hausler.<P>

   ``We're working a lot of hours, but we're happy here,'' he said. ``We're not doing this for the money. We want to help people.''<P>

   Customers such as Jason Feldman and Holli Adams rely on the store to help maintain a healthy diet.<P>

    ``It takes as much effort to stop here than go to McDonald's,'' Feldman said.<P>

   The Kendall Natural Food Market is also swamped with orders for medicinal herbs. Especially popular: the herb echinacea that fights infections and mushrooms, such as reishi and shitaki, that build up the immune system. An infection-fighting algae called spirulina is also popular.<BR>
   Borders Book Shop, just two stores away, has benefited from the interest in the New Age cures.<P>

   Many Natural Food Market customers come over to buy books to learn more, said Art Lage, the Kendall Borders' inventory manager.<P>

   They snap up books by New Age philosopher Marianne Williamson and Deepak Chopra, whose bestselling books include Ageless Body, Timeless Mind,  and Twenty Spiritual Lessons for Creating the Life You Want. <P>

   Shoppers at Borders are also interested in alternative medicine -- enough for the store to launch a section just on that, Lage said.<P>

   ``People run the course: They go to doctors, get the drugs and then when that doesn't help, they look for alternatives,'' he said.
