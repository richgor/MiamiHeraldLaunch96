<m0>   Wanted: Ulises Herrera, a 24-year-old man who police say gunned down someone in the street over a dead dog.<ep>
   Murdered: Jose ``Buddha'' Bottino, 32, a Hialeah resident whose mistake was standing in front of Herrera's house when Herrera found out his beloved pooch was dead.<ep>
   Police issued an arrest <m4>Herrera<m2><ql>
<m0>warrant for Herrera, but as of Friday night <m1> <m0>he had managed to elude police. The slight, five-foot five-inch man was last seen in North Central Dade riding a green bicycle.<ep>
   Police say Herrera charged out of his home at 9375 NW 30th Ct. about 2 p.m. Wednesday in a fury. His dog was dead, and he was determined to make someone pay for it.<ep>
   First, Herrera buried his pet. <ep>
   Then, police said, he beat his girlfriend, who is five months pregnant. He struck her stomach with his fists and a can of potato chips.<ep>
   After the beating, police said Herrera discovered cash missing from his wallet, which infuriated him even more.<ep>
   ``He told his girlfriend that somebody was going to pay for his dog's death,'' said Metro-Dade police spokesman Rudy Espinosa. ``He was irate. He looked outside and said, `As a matter of fact, Buddha will die.' ''<ep>
   Herrera, witnesses said, stormed out and headed for Bottino. He allegedly shot him several times, then turned the handgun on another man.<ep>
   The gun jammed.<ep>
   ``Buddha was standing over there, doing nothing to nobody,'' said the would-be victim, who did not want to be identified. ``Ulises comes out of his house saying he's no good; he's this; he's that. He just shoots him in the neck and chest. He shot him like a dog for nothing. Nothing led up to it.''<ep>
   Espinosa said Herrera hopped on a bicycle and rode off. <m1> <m0>Police would like anyone who knows Herrera's whereabouts to call Crimestoppers at (305) 471-TIPS.<ql>
