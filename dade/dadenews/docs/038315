   Dressed in green Ocean Reef Resort uniforms, the four men were just trying to get to work.<ep>
   They piled into a 1988 Mercury Cougar to make the trek from Homestead to their jobs in Key Largo. The same trip down a narrow two-lane road they made every day.<ep>
   At 7:15 a.m. Thursday, as Carlos Mejia drove his white Cougar south on Card Sound Road about a mile off U.S. 1, they were cut short. A northbound 1972 Ford dump truck lost control, smashed into the Cougar, rolled over on top of it, slicing the top off the car. Part of the truck wound up in an adjacent canal.<ep>
   The truck's load of gravel spilled all over the road.<ep>
   And worst: Three co-workers died instantly; a fourth, Mejia, a lawn worker from Mexico, died later at Jackson Memorial Hospital Ryder Trauma Center. The two seated in the back were Jean Claude Rodolphe, 45, and Jose Gaspar, 30, both of Homestead.<ep>
   The name of a 66-year-old man who was thrown from the front seat was not released because he has no family in the United States. Police plan to contact the Mexican Consulate today for help locating family members. <ep>
   Metro-Dade police said they may file careless driving charges against truck driver Robert Monteagudo, 53, of Southwest 134th Avenue. He is in serious but stable <m1> <m0>condition at Jackson. There were no drugs or alcohol in his blood, police said.<ep>
   ``It apparently was his fault,'' said Metro-Dade spokesman Ed Munn. ``Charges are anticipated.''<ep>
   Metro-Dade police spokeswoman Marie Duboulay said traffic homicide detectives need to investigate the crash further before they decide what kind of charges to pursue.<ep>
   ``We'll look to see if there were any mechanical problems or if the truck was overloaded,'' Duboulay said. <ep>
   The mess on the road caused the closing of Card Sound Road from the toll plaza to U.S. 1 for almost nine hours. <ep>
   A person who saw the accident from the car behind Mejia's knew him and contacted his family. His stunned aunts and uncle showed up at the scene to talk to police and just stare at the wreck. <ep>
   ``I can't believe this,'' said Guillermo Medina, his uncle. ``He was just on his way to work. He's been taking this same road from Homestead to Key Largo every day for the past 2 1/2 years.''<ep>
   Mejia, he said, arrived from Mexico about five years ago. He worked as a maintenance worker at the resort, where employees said they were not allowed to give out any information about the workers. <ql>
