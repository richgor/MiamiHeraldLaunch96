   Two children were playing alone beside an apartment pool Monday afternoon in North Miami Beach. Ramon Hamilton fell in. John Madden held on to his playmate's clothing as long as he could. No one heard them cry for help. <P>

   ``There were no adults around,'' police detective Ron Friedman said. <P>

   Both boys were 5-years-old at the time of the accident. One day, John will be 6. Ramon will not.<P>

   This is what the investigator said happened: <P>

   The boys were playing together outside Ramon's apartment at 16799 NE 21st Ave. The building doesn't have a pool. Ramon's mother, Latonga Hamilton, was indoors watching television. <P>

   She did not know it when the boys walked across the street to John's home. There's a pool there. John's mother was indoors packing bags, getting ready for the family to move upstate.<P>

   ``They were playing together, when one child pushed the other child, and he fell into the pool,'' Friedman said. ``It was totally an accident. He wasn't trying to push him into the pool. He just pushed him, just goofing around, and he fell.''<P>

   John reached into the water, caught Ramon by his clothing and held him against the edge of the pool -- but he could not pull him out of the water, and Ramon could not hold on. Neither could John.<P>

   ``He lost his grip,'' Friedman said. ``Then, yelling, `Help! Help!' he ran and got his mother. She jumped in the pool and got the other child out, but it was too late.''<P>

   A uniformed officer, James Ramirez, was the first to answer the emergency alarm. He tried to revive Ramon until Metro-Dade paramedics arrived. They failed, too. Ramon's mother had thought he was still playing in his own yard with his friend John.<P>

   ``She didn't know anything until she heard the sirens and went over and saw her only child,'' Friedman said. ``It was very tough on her. Tough on us, too. We all have children. We don't understand when 5-year-olds are left unattended.''
