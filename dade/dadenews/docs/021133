<m0>  Math comes naturally to Aldo Gonzalez, and so does helping those for whom math or computers does not come so naturally.<ep>
   Gonzalez was frustrated to see fellow students (--) including his sister (--) struggle with the math section of the High School Competency Test.<ep>
   Using programming he learned interning at NASA, Gonzalez created a series of tests that encouraged students to participate in after-school study sessions for the exam.<ep>
   ``The students have had such a positive reaction,'' said math chair Joan Friedman. ``Occasionally, a class is enriched by such a student: a student who forces others to think, who puts himself, not his teachers, in charge of learning, and who cares about others.''<ep>
   Gonzalez ranks third in his class and scored 1480 on the SAT, including a perfect 800 on the math portion.<ep>
