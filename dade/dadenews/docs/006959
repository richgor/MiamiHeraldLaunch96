   New Times Newspapers of Florida went to court Friday in an effort to compel Tony Ridder, chairman of Knight-Ridder, to provide access to his paperwork on Dade County's proposed arena project.<ep>
   A lawyer for the weekly newspaper said Ridder had not complied with a request by New Times for documents under Florida's public records law. Knight-Ridder general counsel Cristina Mendoza said the lawsuit was filed before the company had a chance to respond to the request.<ep>
   ``The fundamental disagreement is whether Mr. Ridder in his civic capacity is obligated to abide by the public records law,'' said George Rahdert of Rahdert & Anderson in St. Petersburg, the law firm representing New Times. ``He has taken a position to date that he does not have an obligation to provide those records.''<ep>
   Ridder was appointed in February by the Metro-Dade Commission to lead the county's effort to keep the Miami Heat in town. The commission agreed March 29 to build a $165 million arena for the team based on a financing plan prepared by Ridder and others.<ep>
   Rahdert said the lawsuit filed in Dade Circuit Court seeks ``all of the paperwork that led up to the deal.''<ep>
   Mendoza said the request was made Monday. ``They have not spoken to one person in Knight-Ridder who said we are not going to produce documents,'' Mendoza said. ``We haven't even responded, and I know the law gives us a reasonable time.''<ep>
   Ridder previously released some but not all paperwork in response to a written request by The Herald, among others. Knight-Ridder owns The Herald. Ridder declined to provide copies of at least one letter he received from the Heat.<ep>
   Rahdert said a hearing on the lawsuit will be held May 20. The case has been assigned to Circuit Judge Robert Kaye.<ep>
