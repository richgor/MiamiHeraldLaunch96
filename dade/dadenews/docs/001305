   Metro-Dade police cadet Juan Suarez once planned to put criminals behind bars. Now, he finds himself in jail, on trial and potentially facing prison.<ep>
   Suarez, 10 days shy of graduating from the police academy, allegedly aimed a shotgun at a night watchman last year and commandeered his white 1988 Ford Mustang convertible out of an impound lot. The car had been repossessed.<ep>
   ``He said he loved this car,'' Miami detective Rudy Herrera told jurors Monday. ``He said he always wanted a car like this since he was a child.''<ep>
   Suarez, 25, plans to tell jurors his side of the story this morning in Dade Circuit Court. Through his lawyer, Suarez has maintained his innocence.<ep>
   ``I hate to see that anyone can get arrested on this kind of questionable evidence,'' attorney Michael Voigt said Monday after court. ``The state's main witness is a guy on Xanax who uses a magnifying glass to make an ID.''<ep>
   Prosecutor Percy Martinez told jurors that Suarez was so obsessed with the convertible that he ruined his chance for an honorable career. Metro terminated Suarez after the Sept. 10 arrest, court records indicate.<ql>
<m0>Burglary, robbery charges<ep>
<m0>   He is charged with burglary, robbery and faces three to five years in prison. According to the arrest affidavit, this is what happened:<ep>
   On Sept. 8, Oria Nun~ez and her crew repossessed the Mustang after the finance company called in the loan. Suarez was two months behind on his car payment, about $236 a month.<ep>
   Nun~ez took the car to her lot at 2630 NW 37th St. The following night, watchman Manuel Medina said Suarez showed up and demanded his car.<ep>
   ``He said as soon as he had a chance he would take the car,'' Medina told jurors.<ep>
   Medina told Suarez he didn't have the car's keys and told him to return at 10:30 a.m.<ep>
   He said that about 2 a.m. Suarez slipped into the lot, which is surrounded by a tall fence. Suarez carried a short-barreled shotgun, Medina testified.<ql>
<m0>Deadly threat alleged<ep>
<m0>   ``The car or your life,'' Medina quoted the cadet.<ep>
   ``He pointed the shotgun at me,'' Medina said. ``It was all very quick.''<ep>
     Police claim Suarez used bolt cutters to slice the fence and drive off.<ep>
   Officers arrested Suarez hours later at his home. They found the car several blocks away.<ep>
   The arrest was made primarily on the testimony of Medina. He said he used a magnifying glass to pick Suarez out of a lineup, which consisted of a 48-photo booklet from the defendant's cadet class.<ep>
   On Monday, Voigt attacked Medina's eyesight and his mindset.<ep>
   Without a magnifying glass in court, Medina could not tell that Suarez had a mustache in the cadet book.<ep>
   Medina also said he suffers from ``psychiatric problems'' and takes Xanax, an anti-anxiety medication.<ep>
   The defendant's wife then testified. At times, her testimony was contradictory.<ep>
   Jordana Suarez said her husband was ``not obsessed'' with the Mustang and they were going to buy another car that weekend.<ep>
   Yet, she said, her husband planned to use money he had saved for a bullet-proof vest to get back the convertible.<ql>
