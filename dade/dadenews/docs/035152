OF THE WEEK<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) State Road 826. <m0>One lane will be closed from 9:30 p.m. to midnight and two lanes will be closed from midnight to 5:30 a.m. today through Wednesday between Northwest 67th Avenue and Interstate 75 so workers can remove barrier walls. Also, the northbound on-ramp to I-75 will be closed until noon Saturday to build a barrier wall.<ql>

<m0>OTHER PLACES TO AVOID<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0> <m0>(box) Biscayne Boulevard: <m0>One northbound lane will be closed between Northeast 23rd and 26th Streets while workers install new sewer systems.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,4<ql>
<m0>CONTINUING FRUSTRATION<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) The months-long <m0>project to rebuild the Biscayne Boulevard bridge over Little River between Northeast 76th and 79th Streets. Lanes will remain closed until <m4> BEGIN LEG #2 <m0>June.<ql>

<m0>TRAFFIC TIPS<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) Speed Enforcement. <m0>Starting today, the Florida Highway Patrol will enforce more vigorously speed limits in construction zones on State Road 826, the Palmetto Expressway. Additional state troopers will patrol a three-mile corridor from north of Northwest 103rd Street to Northwest 158th Street between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. on weekdays. The posted 45-mile-per hour limit has been largely ignored.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) SunPass Tolls. <m0>Last week Diane Neer of Weston wrote to say she was fed up with Florida's Turnpike toll system because new coin machines seem to take longer in letting drivers through than the old machines. Relief is a long way off. A new and hopefully quicker electronic toll collection system called SunPass may be up and running in South Florida (--) by December 1997, said Christine W. Speer, director of <m4> BEGIN LEG #3 <m0>Florida's Office of Toll Operations.<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,4<ql>
<m0>WHAT'S NEW<ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) Low Bus. <m0>The Metro-Dade Transit Agency may buy a new type of low-floor bus that would allow passengers to board without climbing the steps on conventional buses. The floor of the low-bus is only 14 inches above the road. A ramp slides out of the low-bus for people in wheelchairs.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Tri-Rail. <m0>A controversial proposal to study whether Tri-Rail, a Hialeah to West Palm Beach commuter train, should continue operating will be discussed by Dade's Metropolitan Planning Organization Thursday. The proposal comes from the MPO's Citizens Transportation Advisory Committee, which is looking for new members. If you're interested, call staff aide Clinton Forbes at 375-4507.<ql>
