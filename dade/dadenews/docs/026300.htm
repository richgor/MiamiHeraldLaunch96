   More than one in 10 Floridians drank tap water from utilities that violated federal health guidelines in the last two years, according to a report released Thursday by a coalition of environmental and consumer groups.<P>

   Overall, the report says standards for bacteria or lead were exceeded at least once by 61 Dade County drinking water wells or utilities. Among people whose water was not always up to snuff, the report says: residents of North Miami, Bal Harbour, Medley and Florida City.<P>

   Regulators, public health officials and utility directors strongly denied the report's implication that public drinking water is unsafe. Some were outraged.<P>

   ``This is ridiculous! Where are they getting their information from?'' said Tom Mueller, the engineer who monitors drinking water for the Broward Public Health Unit. ``We've had no violations. No bacterial outbreaks. No real problems.''<P>

   Doug Yoder, assistant director of Dade's Department of Environmental Resource Management, said a detection of a contaminant in a single water sample does not constitute a violation of drinking water standards as the report implies.<P>

   ``I don't think any of the information this report presents correlates with any public health impact or violation,'' Yoder said.<P>

   The report by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group says that more than 45 million Americans drank water supplied by utilities that violated treatment standards since 1994. The report used data supplied by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.<P>

   Environmentalists say the report shows the importance of maintaining high federal drinking water standards. Congress will soon consider a bill environmentalists say would weaken the Safe Drinking Water Act.<P>

   ``It is truly outrageous that with the number of health violations and the overwhelming public concern about the quality of our drinking water that the Congress would even consider proposals to weaken public health protections,'' said Beth Kidder of the Florida Public Interest Group, which released the report in Tallahassee.<P>

   The report shows that more than 1.8 million people in 957 Florida communities drank water from utilities that had a violation of the standard. There were also 96 schools, day care centers and medical facilities that reported drinking water violations.
