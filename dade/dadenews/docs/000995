<m0>  TALLAHASSEE (--) Two 30-something Dade lawmakers who are likely contenders to preside over the Legislature in 1998 (--) Sen. Mario Diaz-Balart and Rep. Willie Logan (--) stood out among the highest-performing legislators in The Herald's annual effectiveness ratings.<ep>
  Diaz-Balart, R-West Dade, was ranked No. 1 in the 40-member Senate by a panel of lobbyists, public-policy experts and reporters.<ep>
  Logan, D-Opa-locka, ranked No. 2 in the 120-member House (--) right behind Pensacola Rep. Buzz Ritchie, the Democratic speaker-designate.<ep>
  The 34-year-old Diaz-Balart is a public relations executive and chairs the Ways and Means panel that writes the state's $40 billion budget. Logan, 39, is a management consultant who chairs the Finance and Taxation panel.<ep>
<m0>Top-flight list<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   They weren't the only Dade lawmakers viewed as movers and shakers in the state Capitol. Ten of Dade's 27-member delegation were ranked among the state's most effective lawmakers. <m1><ep>
<m0>  Joining Diaz-Balart in the Senate's top rung are Democrats Daryl Jones (7) and Ron Silver (8). <m1><ep>
<m0>  Jones, 40, is a South Dade lawyer and investment banker who is the Democrats' next choice for Senate president. But Democrats aren't expected to win the majority they need for Jones to take over. Silver, 52, is a lawyer from North Miami Beach and chairman of the Dade delegation.<ep>
  Seven Dade lawmakers made the top quarter in the House rankings, Logan included. The others: Rudy Garcia (9), John Cosgrove (10), Elaine Bloom (19), Beryl Roberts-Burke (21), Alex Villalobos (28) and Luis Morse (30).<ep>
<m0>Spreading the power<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   Three of them are Republicans, which shows the shrinking power gap between parties in the Democratic-led House. They are: Garcia, 33, a full-time legislator from Hialeah; Cuban Caucus Chairman Alex Villalobos, 32, a West Dade lawyer; and Morse, 55, a Little Havana engineer.<ep>
  Rounding out the top-ranked Democrats: Cosgrove, 46, a lawyer from Perrine; Bloom, 58, of Miami Beach, Florida development director for Bar-Ilan University; and Roberts-Burke, 37, a Miami lawyer.<ep>
  Two Dade lawmakers' rankings fell significantly: Rep. Larcenia Bullard, a Richmond Heights Democrat; and Miami Republican Sen. Alberto Gutman.<ep>
