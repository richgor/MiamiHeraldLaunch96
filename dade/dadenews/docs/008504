<m0>  Diaz-Balart, who has ambitions to become Senate president in 1998, earned his top ranking by virtue of his job as Ways and Means chairman. His biggest accomplishment: boosting education spending. But another GOP priority (--) no new taxes (--) meant cuts from other areas. To boost schools spending, the Senate tried to slash about $300 million from social services. Budget talks with the House reduced that to a $190 million cut. Too busy with the budget to handle much else, Diaz-Balart didn't deal with many other issues. But he did promote two bills that met with mixed results. He tried to pass a constitutional amendment to double the homestead exemption for fixed-income senior citizens. It never had a chance because House Speaker Peter Wallace blocked the plan, saying it hurt younger home owners by shifting the tax burden to them. Diaz-Balart had better luck (--) as he did in the budget (--) with education issues. His plan to let school districts use lottery money for school construction bonds cleared the Legislature without a hitch.<ql>

<m0>  It was a low-key session for a man designated to be Senate president (--) by Democrats not likely to gain control. He clung to the agendas of others: the governor's fight against tobacco and House members' bills. He half-heartedly pushed a plan to give a big pay raise to Dade commissioners as a favor to Rep. Luis Rojas. Jones liked the pay hike idea, but preferred it be done as Dade's charter requires: by countywide vote. After it cleared one panel, he refused to pursue it. He worked so school cops can make arrests beyond school borders. He fought to keep kids like Francisco Del Rey, who killed three people and maimed another with his speeding Corvette, from billing taxpayers for legal expenses when parents can pay. Both bills passed. Beyond a few eloquent speeches, most notably against school prayer, he seemed detached. A likely distraction was his role as fund-raiser for Democratic Senate races. An example of detachment: He was on the panel that produced a final budget agreement. But he skipped the last day of negotiations to be in Miami for President Clinton's visit.<ql>

<m0>  The chairman of Dade's 27-member delegation gave up on rallying the diverse and unwieldy group for consensus votes. Instead, he asked Dade, Broward and Palm Beach lawmakers to work together for tricounty clout. The most effective stand: defending South Florida education dollars. As usual, he focused on criminal justice issues. He worked on the Jimmy Ryce Act, which lets communities know when sexual predators are released in their midst (--) and to aid in the search for missing children. He worked to close a loophole allowing kids tried as adults to bill taxpayers for legal expenses, even when parents can pay. He was a vocal opponent of school prayer. He slashed $10 million from the lottery ad budget, a move some believed was a swipe at WPLG-Channel 10. The station runs lots of Lotto ads, and once ran an unflattering story on a gambling trip Silver took when he was supposed to be at a lawmakers' conference. Silver said the money would be better spent on education. He lost that one. Budget negotiators put the $10 million back.<ql>

<m0>  If anyone qualifies as the conscience of the Senate, it's this liberal Democrat who represents Southwest Broward and Northwest Dade. Among hundreds of votes, one stands out: Forman was the only one of 160 lawmakers to vote against the $39.8 billion budget, protesting cuts to the poor and disabled. His principled protest carried a price: Forman was ostracized by the GOP majority. It was no coincidence he lost, over and over, on budget amendments and his bills. As usual, he carried a heavy workload. Advocates for the poor set up shop outside his office. It was not always a happy place. Despite his lone-wolf status, Forman scored victories: a fifth center for autistic people, tighter criteria for handicapped-parking passes, insurance coverage for longer maternity stays for mothers and babies and a study of the much-maligned transportation system for the poor and disabled. When many legislators seem motivated by a lust for power, money or both, Forman stands apart as a politician driven by a philosophy, not the trappings of office.<ql>

<m0>   If this longtime lawmaker is anything, it's predictable. Year after year he has the same agenda: Take care of Hialeah Park and create a special licensure path for a Dade-based group of Cuba- and Nicaragua-trained doctors. This year, he managed to do both. Helping out the thoroughbred track wasn't hard. As Regulated Industries chairman, he wields life-and-death power over parimutuel bills. Hanging in the balance was a sweeping packet of laws with everything from an expansion of betting at tracks to industry-wide tax breaks. Translation: a big-money, must-pass bill. Casas wouldn't sign off on it until it gave Hialeah Park an extra perk: the ability to take bets on races broadcast live from Calder Race Course. He got it. He also helped pass a plan to create a new licensing exam for a limited group of foreign-trained doctors. Another win came for his plan to give parents twice as long to sue when their infants are victims of medical mistakes. It went to the governor.<ql>

<m0>  Once Health Care chairman, Gutman's power took a dive when he quit his post amid charges he used the position for financial gain. This was a reputation-mending year. He made hay of every high-profile case to hit South Florida: Two Plantation cops nearly lost health benefits after being severely injured. His bill forced cities to pay disabled cops' premiums. A tot died at the hands of a hit-and-run driver who confessed after a prosecution deadline. He did away with the statute of limitations. Four pilots were shot down by Cuban fighter jets. He pushed a Castro-condemning plan and the Cuban Freedom Act, a mirror image of the Helms-Burton law. Gutman had plenty of fodder for the district newsletter. Every issue passed. One not likely to make the newsletter: On the last day of session, he nearly amended to death a plan to regulate firms that buy life insurance policies from terminally ill patients. He gave up his killer amendments after sponsors retaliated by trying to amend to death one of <m0>his<m0>  bills: the one to protect cops' health benefits.<ql>

<m0>  This Dade County schools administrator stuck close to an education agenda. His take-home bill (--) raising high-school graduation standards from a 1.5 grade-point average to a 2.0 (--) got mixed in with one of the controversial issues of the session. By the last night, it was loaded down with lots of education bills, including one allowing school prayer. Turner has long opposed prayer in public schools. He said as much in an impassioned speech that didn't have an effect on the conservative Senate. The bill passed, prayer included. Most of his other victories came on easy-to-pass plans, like one naming State Road 112 for the late Dewey Knight Jr. Once, he showed he could muscle through a tough bill. He pushed a $250,000 claims bill for a man who was falsely arrested and had aggravated an old neck injury in a Dade jail cell (--) where he slept on the floor for a week. Senators killed the plan, 17-18. But Turner worked the room until he persuaded them to vote again. When they did, he'd changed enough minds that it passed on a 20-16 vote.<ql>
