   Joe Aniello's ``nightmare'' began when Hurricane Andrew destroyed 12 group homes for 96 severe cerebral palsy patients. It should have ended Tuesday when United Cerebral Palsy welcomed the first wave of patients into 12 new facilities in South Dade.<ep>
    But instead of celebration, Aniello, the agency's executive director, is bracing for yet another storm.<ep>
    Services for Dade's poor and disabled were hit hard by state budget cuts this year, and United Cerebral Palsy was no exception. Funding was cut by 20 percent (--) $33 million (--) for intermediate care facilities, or group homes, for the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled. Aniello says the funding shortfall will cause his agency to default on the $18.5 million bond issuance that funded the group homes' construction.<ep>
   Under the cuts, the amount the state pays to United Cerebral Palsy for each patient's expenses would go from an average of $80,000 to $36,000. That would make it nearly impossible to meet the $205,000 monthly debt service payment, Aniello said.<ep>
   ``I would bankrupt this agency in a month if I had to make up the difference,'' Aniello said. ``This, on top of everything else we've been through is cruel and unusual punishment.''<ep>
   Aniello has asked the state for a special appropriation of $2.5 million to meet this year's payment schedule. He hasn't received an answer.<ep>
   Terry Farmer, president of the Florida Association of Rehabilitation Facilities, said the cuts come as a ``double whammy'' for United Cerebral following the delays and headaches of getting the group homes funded and approved.<ep>
   When the agency first tried to rebuild, South Dade residents protested, claiming group home patients would threaten area children and lower property values. It took a federal lawsuit to finally pave the way for construction.<ep>
   ``After fighting uphill more than three years, just when they're ready to start moving people in, the state pulls the carpet out from under their feet,'' Farmer said. ``It's vengeful, irrational public policy. That's the only way I can describe it.''<ep>
   But Rep. Lars Hafner, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Health and Human Services, said the cut was prompted by cost disparities among the various care facilities' and their high administrative costs.<ep>
   During site visits to private group homes throughout the state, Hafner said committee members found that the agencies' annual per patient costs ranged from $30,000 to $70,000 for basically the same level of care.<ep>
   ``The site visits were a wake-up call,'' Hafner said. ``The committee felt that money was being made on this particular program, and something had to be done to protect the taxpayers' money.''<ep>
   Farmer said the cost disparities reflect the different levels of care provided and severity of patients' illnesses. Patients in UCP facilities are confined to wheelchairs or beds and unable to dress, clothe, bathe and in some cases, even lift themselves.<ep>
   Caught in the middle are patients like Kim Sorcinelli. She was 22 years old and on the brink of death when her father, Don, brought her for care at United Cerebral Palsy. Earlier this month, she celebrated her 32nd birthday.<ep>
   ``That's 10 years longer than the best doctor I could find gave her to live,'' Sorcinelli said. ``She's alive today because of the grace of God and United Cerebral Palsy.''<ep>
   During her years at state institutions, Sorcinelli said his daughter suffered the effects of heavy medication to control her seizures. ``She had no seizures but she had no life,'' Sorcinelli said. ``They medicated her till she was like a zombie.''<ep>
   Not so at United Cerebral Palsy's small state-supported facilities where a team of nurses, therapists and other care givers provide round-the-clock attention. ``With the kind of medical care and skilled nursing she gets here, they can run the risk of less medication so that she's awake during the day.''<ep>
   Sorcinelli's medical expenses, and those of 2,200 other patients throughout Florida, were paid in full through a federal program that splits the patients' bill 55 percent to 45 percent between the federal government and the state. In addition to guaranteeing care for those who qualify, the program guarantees that service providers will be reimbursed at ``adequate and reasonable rates.''<ep>
   But Hafner said some legislators felt the guarantee makes it easy for facilities to pad their expenses, leaving the state with no recourse but to pay. So along with the cuts, lawmakers opted out of the federal program. The new budget shifts funding for patient care to an area of the Medicaid budget that doesn't entitle people to services or guarantee full reimbursement for their costs. Instead, Medicaid will determine on a case-by-case basis what patient expenses it will or will not cover.<ep>
   Aniello said every profession has its share of scofflaws, but an entire industry, as well as the patients, shouldn't be punished for the sins of a few. The cuts could force many providers out of business and patients into less expensive facilities that don't provide the same levels of care.<ep>
   ``These people seem to be very unimportant,'' Aniello said of the disabled. ``They don't pay taxes, they don't vote, they don't protest. So when you cut them, they're not going to make a lot of noise.'<ep>
   Over the next four weeks, Sorcinelli and UCP's other hurricane-displaced patients will move from their temporary location at the old Humana Hospital building in Pembroke Park into the new group homes.<ep>
   If United Cerebral Palsy does default on the properties, Hafner said the state probably will take over the facilities. There's been talk that Gov. Lawton Chiles may veto part of the budget's $187 million in health and human service cuts. But in an election year when Democrats and Republicans are both trimming budgets, neither Farmer, nor Aniello is betting on that. The agency's first installment payment is due June 25.<ep>
   ``I really don't know what we're going to do,'' Aniello said.<ql>
