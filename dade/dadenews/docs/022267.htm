     Lois Parks never took no for an answer. She brought mental health issues to the forefront during the 1940s when others were virtually unaware of them.<P>

   Parks, a former director of the Mental Health Society of Greater Miami, died of a stroke Tuesday. She was 90.<P>

   Born in 1906 in Michigan, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1927 from Kalamazoo College in Michigan. She went on to receive a master's degree in social work from Case Western Reserve in Cleveland in 1930.<P>

   In the mid-1930s, she moved with her family to Miami Beach. She became acting director for the Dade County Council of Social Agencies in 1949.<P>

   At the time, Florida had two hospitals for the mentally ill: Chattahoochee, built before the Civil War, and Arcadia, where the roofs were made out of tar paper, according to a 1963 story in The Herald. Hospitals were crowded, and trained personnel were desperately needed. <P>

   Parks assisted in the newly organized Mental Health Society, created in 1947 to educate the public about mental-health needs. She eventually became its executive director. She began working with only a typewriter, a small budget, a Legislature and a naive public, The Herald reported.<P>

    For 14 years, she lobbied the Legislature to build the South Florida State Mental Hospital in Pembroke Pines. She told The Herald in 1963 that it was her most significant accomplishment.<P>

   Park believed that providing a hospital for patients near their homes would increase patient morale. The hospital originally was going to be built in Okeechobee.<P>

   ``She was a strong, tenacious advocate,'' said Janet McAliley, a member of the Dade County School Board who volunteered with the Mental Health Association, where she met Parks. ``She would visit Tallahassee every year and lobby for mental health. The agency did not have a lot of money, so she slept on friends' couches.''<P>

   In 1963, Parks was forced to resign her post.<P>

   ``She had a forceful personality,'' McAliley said. ``I'm sure she rubbed some people the wrong way.''<P>

   She then worked as a consultant for five years. In her later years, she spent time between her homes on Lake Michigan and in Key Biscayne.<P>

   Parks is survived by her sister Jane, of Key Biscayne.<P>

   A memorial service will be at 2 p.m. Tuesday at St. Christopher's-by-the-Sea, 95 Harbor Dr., Key Biscayne. Memorial contributions may be sent to St. Christopher's-by- the-Sea.
