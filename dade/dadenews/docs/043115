<m0>   A federal grand jury on Tuesday indicted five men for kidnapping a mother and her two boys and then demanding ransom for the children, the U.S. attorney said.<ep>
   The carjacking occurred Jan. 11 when four robbers waited in a white Jaguar outside the home of Idania Arias in Southwest Dade near Miller Road and Southwest 97th Avenue.<ep>
   When Arias and her two small sons arrived and got out of their Lexus, the robbers pointed guns at them and forced them into their car. They took the keys to the Lexus, blindfolded the family with duct tape, and drove them to an unknown place.<ep>
   Arias was later released and allowed to go home. But the kidnappers asked for a $500,000 ransom in exchange for the children. According to the indictment, the Arias family is in the medical supply business.<ep>
   The next day, a site was arranged to pick up the money and the boys. Shortly afterward, police arrested Ilvigio Hernandez of Hialeah and Humberto Munoz of Miami. They are charged with conspiracy, carjacking and using a firearm for a crime.<ep>
   The boys (--) ages 7 and 4 (--) were found unharmed at the Jamaican Motel, 4601 SW Eighth St.<ep>
   Three other men involved in the conspiracy have been indicted, but their identities are not known. They are listed in the indictment as John Doe I, also known as Papo; John Doe II, also known as Cuco; and John Doe III, also known as El Negro.<ep>
   If convicted, the men face a maximum prison sentence of 25 years.<ep>
   Anyone with information on the three unidentified men can contact the FBI at 944-9101. <m1>  <m2><ep>
