<ep>
<m0>   A construction worker was killed Friday morning after the arm of a small crane he was driving came down on his head.<ep>
   The incident occurred about 9:30 a.m. at a construction site at <m0>1557 NW 27th Ave.<m0><ep>
   Miami police said 42-year-old Ubaldo Opizo, an independent contractor for Gran Realty, was using the crane to fill a ditch. He lifted a boulder and hauled it across the side of a concrete wall. Opizo stood up to see where the boulder landed and was hit by the crane's arm after it came down.<ep>

<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   Miami police said Friday they have made their fourth and final arrest in the April 26 shooting at <m0>Miami High School. <m0><ep>
   A 15-year-old Miami High student was arrested Friday at the school by detectives of the Miami Police Gang Unit. He confessed that he met with Nahin Palma, who is accused of the shooting, and two other youths to plan a fight with a rival street gang, said police spokesman Delrish Moss. ``He knew that a gun would be involved,'' Moss said.<ep>
   Palma is accused of shooting Alex Esquivel and Belmy Monterrey during the melee. The youth arrested Friday was charged with principal in the first degree to attempted first-degree murder, a charge similar to conspiracy, police said.<ql>

<ue5><m0>Torricelli raises campaign funds<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., collected about $37,000 in campaign contributions and much applause by anti-Castro Cubans during a visit Friday to Miami.<ep>
   Torricelli, who will seek the U.S. Senate seat for New Jersey left vacant by fellow Democrat Bill Bradley, was the guest of honor at a Grand Doubletree Hotel dinner organized by real estate entrepreneur Jorge L. Reyes.<ep>
      Torricelli was the architect of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, which tightened the trade embargo the U.S. imposed on Cuba in 1960. The Helms-Burton Act, enacted in March, tightened them further.<ep>
