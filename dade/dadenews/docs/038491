<ep>
<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) The Justice Department will grant Metro-Dade County $300,000 to improve its <m0>drug court <m0>for nonviolent offenders, Attorney General Janet Reno announced Thursday.<ep>
  Reno, who advocated the drug program as Dade state attorney, announced the award as part of an $8.5 million grant to 16 communities around the country.<ep>
  Drug court requires offenders to undergo periodic testing and substance abuse treatment. Offenders who fail are subject to additional sanctions, including jail.<ep>
   ``These courts are making a difference,'' Reno said at her regular Justice Department news briefing, where officials cited a study of the nation's first drug court in Miami as revealing a 30 percent reduction in rearrests for drug court graduates compared with nondrug court offenders.<ql>

<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   Employers of the four men killed in a massive auto wreck Thursday have started a fund for the victims' families.<ep>
   Four lawn maintenance workers, Bonafaccio Navarro, 66, Carlos Mejia (also known as Santos Vertis), 22, Jean Claude Rodolphe, 45, and Jose Gaspar, 30, were killed Thursday morning as they drove along <m0>Card Sound Road <m0>headed for work. A truck traveling in the opposite direction lost control, turning over on top of Mejia's car.<ep>
   The men were all employees of Tropics North, a commercial landscaping company.<ep>
    Contributions may be sent to The Trust Account for the Surviving Families, Tropics North Inc., c/o Community Bank, 28801 SW 157th Ave., Homestead, Fla. 33033. The account number is: 010124032020.<ep>

<ep>
<m0>   <m0>Barry L. Conrad, <m0>the Dade businessman who died in the crash of a U.S. government plane in Croatia last month, will have a street named in his memory in a ceremony Monday.<ep>
   The five blocks, on Southwest 94th Street from 87th to 92nd avenues, will be named Barry L. Conrad Drive. The street runs past Baptist Hospital, to which Conrad was a contributor, said an aide to Metro Commissioner Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, who sponsored the resolution.<ep>
   ``He was very enthusiastic about our community and lent his time and leadership skills in support of many of our local organizations and charities,'' Diaz de la Portilla said in a statement.<ep>
   Conrad, founder of The Barrington Group and a former president at Miami-based Burger King, was a passenger on the ill-fated plane carrying U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown on a trade mission April 3.<ep>
   <m4>Conrad<m2><ql>
<m0>The renaming ceremony will take place at 2 p.m. at Southwest 87th Avenue and 94th Street.<ql>

   Two men were critically wounded by gunfire in unrelated incidents within minutes of each other late Friday in Dade County.<ep>
   In the first shooting about 10:15 p.m., residents of <m0>Southwest Dade <m0>heard several shots fired in the 9300 block of Southwest 39th Street. Afterward, neighbors noticed a pickup <m1> <m0>had crashed into several parked cars. <m1> <m0>Inside the truck, fire-rescue workers found a man suffering from a gunshot wound, said Metro-Dade police spokesman Rudy Espinosa.<ep>
   Across town, the second shooting occurred 15 minutes later in <m0>North Dade <m1> <m0>outside a house at 110 NE 174th St. A man was shot in the head.<ep>
   Both men were airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where they were in critical condition late Friday. No other details were available.<ql>

<m0>   A woman's body was found Friday morning in a car submerged in a <m0>Hialeah <m0>canal near 38th Street and West Fourth Avenue.<ep>
   At 11:30 a.m., a passerby noticed a red car in the water and called police. Hialeah fire-rescue divers were called and found the body of Dulce M. Villar, 56, of 570 W. 46th Pl., in the driver's seat.<ep>
   Villar's body was taken to the Dade County medical examiner's office where an autopsy is scheduled for today. Police are not sure what caused the accident or when it happened.<ql>
