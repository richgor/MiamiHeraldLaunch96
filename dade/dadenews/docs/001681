<m0>   Police arrested a Miami Beach man Friday as he got off a plane in New York City and charged him with attempting to kill his girlfriend. <ep>
   Veronica Vasquez was found early Thursday morning sitting on a bus bench in the 1100 block of Washington Avenue. She was soaked in blood, with her hands wrapped in bandages and deep slashes across her back. When police arrived, they discovered she was missing two fingers on her right hand.<ep>
   Gabriel Toasa of 218 11th St. was leaving an American Airlines flight from Miami on Friday afternoon at La Guardia International Airport when he was arrested, said Al Boza, a spokesman for the Miami Beach Police Department. He had blood-stained items in his possession, Boza said. Arrangements have been made to extradite Toasa to Miami Beach.<ep>
   Vasquez first told police that she was attacked by two men after she got off a bus. But while recuperating from surgery at Jackson Memorial Hospital, she told police her boyfriend attacked her because he didn't want to share her love with anyone else.<ql>
