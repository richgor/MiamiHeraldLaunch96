<m0>    Lazaro Martinez, a former Alamo rental car agency employee who was on Death Row for killing two managers, is dead.<ep>
    Martinez, 35, killed himself early Sunday at the Union Correctional Institute, a maximum-security prison in the North Florida town of Starke.<ep>
    ``It's a suicide,'' said Gene Morris, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Corrections. ``And he left a suicide note.'' <ep>
   Morris said he did not know the contents of the note or how Martinez killed himself.<ep>
    Morris said a guard found Martinez dead in his cell just before 6 a.m. Martinez was last seen alive 30 minutes earlier. Like all Death Row inmates, he had a cell to himself.<ep>
    Union Correctional is across the road from Florida State Prison, home of the electric chair. Men on Death Row are housed in both facilities.<ep>
    Two years ago, Dade Circuit Judge Thomas Carney sentenced Martinez to death for shooting two Alamo supervisors in 1991. During the trial, prosecutor Sally Weintraub told jurors that Martinez took a taxi to the rental agency two days after he was fired for fighting.<ep>
    Weintraub said he came out of the cab armed with a pistol and shotgun and began firing. Scores of tourists and Alamo employees dived for cover around the busy agency, east of Miami International Airport.<ep>
    Martinez killed Ciro Sigler, 31, and Chester Scheel, 49, wounded a third manager, and then started shooting at a police officer. Employees tackled Martinez when he ran out of ammunition.<ep>
    At the trial, defense lawyer Arthur Carter argued that his client was insane at the time of the shooting.<ql>
