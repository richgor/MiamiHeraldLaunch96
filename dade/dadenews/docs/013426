   Surrendering to a barrage of stinging partisan criticism from Republican opponents, Coral Gables lawyer Charles R. ``Bud'' Stack withdrew his candidacy Thursday for a judgeship on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.<ep>
   Stack, 60, a prominent civil lawyer and fund-raiser for President Clinton and the Democratic Party, is the third South Floridian in the last 15 months to drop a bid for the federal judiciary. In February, Bruce Greer, another civil litigator, ended his quest for a district judgeship after old rivals raised behind-the-scenes objections. In February 1995, Miami criminal defense lawyer Ted Klein withdrew after a lengthy wait to be confirmed for another district court vacancy. He cited political and financial concerns.<ep>
   Stack's candidacy (--) once regarded as a fairly safe bet (--) quickly turned to flotsam in the rugged seas of national election-year politics. After his withdrawal, Republicans giddily trumpeted an early campaign victory against the president.<ep>
   ``The citizens of Florida, Alabama and Georgia can rest easier tonight, knowing that Bob Dole stopped Bill Clinton from putting on the bench of their Court of Appeals a man whose No. 1 qualification was his fund-raising prowess,'' Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement.<ep>
   In a letter to Clinton, Stack wrote that despite broad support from fellow lawyers and bar associations, his professional achievements had been ``trivialized'' by politics. The American Bar Association, which helps the White House evaluate its judicial nominees, had rated Stack as ``qualified,'' the middle of three rating levels.<ep>
   The GOP's attacks negated all of that, Stack suggested in his letter.<ep>
   ``These unfortunate conditions have resulted in extended delay of any action by the Senate,'' Stack told the president. ``Moreover, it would be naive of me to believe, under such prevailing conditions, that the Senate would at this time act favorably on my appointment.''<ep>
   Late Thursday, Stack said in an interview that he acted because ``I couldn't get through the Senate on the partisan vote that would have occurred.'' Rather than fight, he said, it was more important ``to focus 100 percent'' on his family, clients and law practice. He is a partner in the Gables firm of High, Stack, Lazenby, Palahach & del Amo.<ep>
   An embittered Florida Sen. Bob Graham, who sent Stack's name to the White House, called his choice ``the unintended victim of a high level of presidential-year partisanship.''<ep>
   Stack's chances eroded appreciably in recent weeks as Dole, the Senate majority leader and likely Republican nominee for president, denounced Stack as a prime example of unacceptable judicial nominees being promoted by the White House.<ep>
   In a speech on the Senate floor last month, Dole urged Clinton to dump Stack, asserting the 35-year litigator was unqualified to sit on the Atlanta-based court. <ep>
<m0>Republican ad<ep>
<m0>   More recently, in advance of a visit to Miami by the president, state Republicans took out an ad in The Herald alleging that Stack was seeking a reward for raising $7 million for Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign and another $3.4 million for the Democratic Party in 1994.<ep>
   To the end, the White House supported Stack and deemed him competent to serve.<ep>
   ``The president continues to believe Stack is qualified and he's been unfairly criticized,'' spokeswoman Julie Green said.<ep>
   But Stack's status as a Democratic activist and Clinton friend made him an easy target for Republican attacks. Recently, he was reported to have lobbied for the judgeship instead of an ambassadorship, according to White House aides quoted in The New York Times.<ep>
   Moreover, Stack was perceived by critics to have stumbled at his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing in February when he said he could not provide specific answers to questions about some Supreme Court rulings, particularly one case involving affirmative action. Stack sought to reassure his questioner, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., that he could brush up on cases with which he was unfamiliar through extra book work and the help of colleagues.<ep>
<m0>Answer ridiculed<ep>
<m0>   Thursday, Barbour, the Republican National Committee chairman, ridiculed the thought:<ep>
   ``The people of this country expect fair and equitable administration of justice from the president's judicial appointees, not trips back to the classroom for remedial education in the law.'' <ep>
   Stack's fate became clear Thursday morning when Sen. Orin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced that Stack's name had been withdrawn.<ep>
   ``I've been asked by the White House to remove this name from the list . . . although we had planned to bring this nomination up for today,'' Hatch said.<ep>
   No one in the room (--) including Democrats (--) asked any questions or made any comments.<ep>
   As the campaign for president unfolds, the Republicans have made Clinton's judicial appointments one of their favorite issues, charging that many of the nominees are ``liberal'' lawyers who favor the rights of criminals over the rights of victims.<ep>
   Graham predicted the 11th Circuit slot sought by Stack would likely remain open well into next year.<ep>
   ``If you were to nominate Oliver Wendell Holmes, I doubt that he could get confirmed between now and November given the climate that's here,'' Graham said.<ql>
