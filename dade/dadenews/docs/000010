   Police and elected authorities in Dade County do not protect freedom of expression and tolerate violent tactics by Cuban exiles to inhibit free expression by others, a group of artists and their supporters said Sunday.<ep>
   The group, meeting in Miami Beach, decried attacks by Cuban exile protesters at an April 10 concert by Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba at the Gusman Center. People arriving for the concert were hit and spat on by the protesters who accused Rubalcaba of complicity with the government of Fidel Castro.<ep>
   City Manager ``Cesar Odio didn't care less,'' said Carlos M. Luis, former director of the local Cuban Museum, which was bombed twice by exile extremists in the 1980s. ``People who met with him after it said he was arrogant about the whole thing.''<ep>
   Odio couldn't be reached for comment.<ep>
    ``Other members of the County Commission and the state Legislature, they tolerate this kind of behavior in order to win the anti-Castro vote,'' Luis said. ``The very people responsible for enforcing the law are active to the contrary.''<ep>
     Among those who participated in the Sunday meeting were Brian Dursum, director of the Lowe Art Museum at the University of Miami; Clive King, chairman of the Visual Arts Department at Florida International University; and other academics and artists.<ep>
   The participants were also sharply critical of the Center for the Fine Arts, which just days after the Rubalcaba incident canceled the appearance of Cuban art critic Gerardo Mosquera, scheduled for this month.<ep>
   ``It was fear what compelled her to do what she did,'' said Luis, referring to CFA director Suzanne Delehanty who decided to cancel Mosquera's appearance. ``Should people make those decisions because of a climate of fear?''<ep>
   Denise Gerson, associate director of the Lowe Museum, questioned whether the county manager's office and the County Commission might have been involved in canceling Mosquera. CFA receives funds from the county.<ep>
   Attorney John de Leon, representing the American Civil Liberties Union, condemned the position taken by David Lawrence Jr., chairman of the CFA board and publisher of The Herald. Lawrence last week publicly backed the decision to cancel Mosquera.<ep>
   ``I find it very distressing that David Lawrence, the publisher of the city's leading newspaper, supported that position,'' de Leon said.<ep>
   Lawrence reiterated his position Sunday that no one's freedom of speech is being violated.<ep>
   De Leon said the local ACLU chapter will study possible legal action stemming from the Mosquera incident.<ep>
   ``If some governmental authority exercised any kind of pressure, then that is prior restraint,'' de Leon said. He said any attempt to prevent free expression is legally actionable.<ep>
   Artist Jacqueline Lipsky said a private gallery was planning to bring Mosquera to speak in Dade in September, but she did not say which gallery was organizing the event.<ep>
   Stephen Malagodi, a producer for radio station WLRN, said CFA should be asked to produce guidelines for who can participate at its facility and who can't.<ep>
    ``Is there a political test for being able to participate at the center?'' he asked. `` Do you have to denounce Castro? Deny you have guidelines or show me the guidelines. One way or the other.''<ep>
   Juan Carlos Espinosa, a researcher at the international studies department at UM, emphasized the need to communicate with the exiles who participate in sometimes violent demonstrations.<ep>
   ``We need to talk to those people who held the signs,'' he said, referring to the night of the Rubalcaba concert.<ep>
   Various participants said they were afraid other cultural institutions would withhold invitations to artists or critics who might provoke demonstrations.<ep>
   ``Directors of museums will simply not invite certain people,'' Luis said. ``It will happen before we know.''<ql>
