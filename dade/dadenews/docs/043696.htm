   On Friday, May 15, 1896, the first issue of the Miami Metropolis hit its hometown's dust-laden streets and the world kept turning.<P>

   Not yet a city, Miami had fewer than 1,000 residents on that day, but nevertheless had managed to open its first bank, the Bank of Bay Biscayne, on May 2 and got its first newspaper two weeks later.<P>

   A weekly, the 10-page Metropolis cost five cents, was charmingly breezy and featured one of the most attractive tropical mastheads in journalism.<P>

    The logo type was topped by a rather presumptive-looking map of Dade County -- then running from the Upper Keys to north of Jupiter -- that contained insets of ``cocoanuts,'' a hand offering ripe bananas and pineapple.<P>

   A Page One box advised customers to ``keep this paper as a souvenir'' as it was ``the most southern newspaper on the mainland of the United States, published at the most southern railroad point in Uncle Sam's domain.''<P>

   In boldface type, ``Marvelous Miami'' was touted, and it sagely prophesied the place was the ``coming metropolis of South Florida.''<P>

   Editor Walter S. Graham kept the first copy of his newspaper, ``to be handed down to those who may succeed us,'' and the original is on display today at the Historical Museum of Southern Florida in downtown Miami.<P>

   Since potential subscribers were few, Graham sought to maximize impact by earmarking delivery into the hands of community's most important persons.<P>

   The second copy was delivered to Julia Tuttle, whose lure of free land got Henry Flagler to extend his railroad south, while the third went to Mary Brickell, who gave Flagler an equal chunk of Brickell family land south of the Miami River.<P>

   There, that same day's paper reported by no coincidence, choice riverside lots were selling for $250 and $300.<P>

   The fourth copy was mailed to Flagler himself -- probably a bit of a slight because Flagler had donated the land for the newspaper's new building and retained Graham as one of his lawyers.<P>

   The newspaper, located on what is now Miami Avenue near the banks of the river, also served as Graham's law offices.<P>

    The fifth copy of the first issue went to writer Kirk Munroe, an early resident of Cocoanut Grove who was at the paper that day. He also was the purchaser of two Brickell lots totaling 150 by 100 feet.<P>

   Munroe was a handsome gentleman who could turn a head as well as a phrase. His story on the new pineapple plantations in Key Largo had been bought in New York and would appear that August in Harper's Weekly.<P>

   ``If we can keep our columns as pure as his writings, the Metropolis will live,'' wrote the newspaper. It lived. The pineapple industry did not.<P>

   The sixth copy went to an actual customer, E.L. White, who had unsuccessfully bid for the first copy.<P>

   The first edition contained short profiles of the city's citizens, as well as advertisements and observations.<P>

   Of all those who may have read it, none would do so with a more critical eye than Flagler, the state's most powerful force.<P>

   Flagler was no fan.<P>

   ``If I had a choice between a den of rattlesnakes and a newspaper, I think I would prefer the snakes,'' he said in 1890, when questioned about investments that seemed to be making him the state's press baron.<P>

   Yet Flagler had financed railroad-controlled newspapers in towns such as Jacksonville and Titusville, where he did business, as well as towns such as Gainesville and Pensacola.<P>

   Dens of snakes maybe, but Flagler apparently shared a view that A.J. Liebling would make famous 50 years later that ``freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one.''<P>

   Nowhere would this be more evident than in Miami. The baby Metropolis would soon bite the hand that fed it at birth.<P>

   In 1903, the Metropolis got a competitor, The Miami Evening Record, which came out six days a week. The Metropolis joined its six-day pace. Both papers contained display ads, listed timetables from Flagler's railroad and steamship lines, and were careful to respect Flagler's vast reach.<P>

   But in 1905, the Metropolis got a new owner, Bobo Dean, and its editorial voice rang with a new anti-Flagler sting lashing out against the railroad monopoly that controlled so much of life in South Florida. Flagler company ads disappeared.<P>

   The more accommodating Evening Record bought out the young Miami Morning News in 1907 and switched to morning publication as The Morning News Record. Afternoons were left to its sharp-tongued rival.<P>

   Yet the morning publication's debts were too high and after a lean year in 1909, it was forced to file for bankruptcy. Who was the white knight most likely to save it but Henry Flagler?<P>

   Frank Shutts, a lawyer appointed federal receiver for the bankrupt morning paper, went to Flagler and argued that ``you need somebody down there to tell your side of the story; to counter the attacks of the Metropolis.''<P>

   Flagler eventually agreed, and ordered Shutts to settle back debts the lawyer reorganized. On Dec. 1, 1910, Shutts began publishing The Miami Herald.<P>

   And the Metropolis? It was renamed The Miami News in 1923 and continued as Miami's first newspaper until death claimed it in 1988, eight years short of a centennial.
