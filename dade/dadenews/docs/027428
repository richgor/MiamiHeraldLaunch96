<m0>   Dade County is mapping a new game plan for building a basketball arena, parking garage and retail development on Biscayne Bay in downtown Miami.<ep>
   The latest wrinkle: The county may rely on parking fees to finance the construction of a parking garage for Miami Heat fans.<ep>
   The county has promised to build 2,500 parking spaces next to the new arena, but Metro managers have had to scramble to find enough money to deliver that pledge.<ep>
   The Metro Commission approved a $210 million financial package March 29, but that plan included state grant money that can't be used for the project.<ep>
   The county is now working to plug that gap. Details haven't been made public, but the broad outlines of the plan are known.<ep>
   County managers say the retail development (--) which accounted for $30 million of the original $210 million (--) may be financed by a private developer, in partnership with the Heat.<ep>
   The county would then use cash produced by the development (--) parking fees and rent payments (--) to pay for a portion of the arena project.<ep>
   Details of that plan may be available later this week.<ep>
   Negotiators for the Heat and the county continue to work on four agreements (--) management, development, licensing and assurance (--) that will define how the arena is built and operated. The entire package may be submitted to the commission for a vote May 21.<ep>
   As of Wednesday, however, Metro officials were still exploring whether those parking fees and rent payments could replace the state grant money, which totaled $5.1 million a year.<ep>
   Two reports by outside consultants appear to support the county's latest financing plan (--) but officials cautioned the numbers are preliminary.<ep>
   In a draft report delivered this week to Port of Miami director Carmen Lunetta, Arthur Andersen estimated a retail and entertainment center of about 200,000 square feet could generate payments of at least $2.4 million.<ep>
   Lunetta has said the county needs $2 million to $2.5 million a year to round out the financing for the $165 million arena.<ep>
   Arthur Andersen suggests that's feasible, but the county has yet to identify a developer or describe the project in detail.<ep>
   Nevertheless, a separate report released last week suggests the development could draw enough shoppers and tourists to support a parking garage.<ep>
   Desman Associates of Chicago estimated visitors would pay $2.9 million a year to park in the arena's garage (--) leaving $2 million after expenses.<ep>
   That assumes a typical customer would pay $2 to park during the day and $6 at night. Desman did not count parking fees paid by basketball fans, since those revenues are earmarked for the arena.<ep>
   If Desman's estimate is accurate, that $2 million could be used to pay for the garage. Lunetta has said the county would need about $2.2 million to cover the debt service on 2,500 parking spaces.<ep>
   Extra money to cover the debt and provide a small cushion for lenders could come from parking fees at the Port of Miami.<ep>
   The county has agreed to provide 2,000 parking spaces at the port for basketball fans, who would be shuttled to the arena. Those spaces could generate $762,000 a year, Desman said.<ep>
   If the county needs a larger cushion to obtain financing, Lunetta suggested the Heat could pledge some of the parking revenue that will flow to the arena.<ep>
   Eric Woolworth, general counsel for the team, said that option had been discussed but that no decision had been made.<ep>
   Lunetta also said the Miami Parking System, the agency that operates city parking meters and garages, may agree to issue bonds to build the garage.<ep>
   Executive Director Clark Cook said the agency typically requires an income stream of 1 1/2 times the debt payment for its bonds.<ql>
