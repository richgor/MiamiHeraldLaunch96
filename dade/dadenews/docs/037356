<m0>   The chain letters of childhood have grown up.<ep>
   The letters that dared you to keep the chain going or risk bad luck have evolved into an inexpensive and illegal pyramid scheme. Delivered by mail and electronically, the pitch is a surreal translation of capitalism: Mail $5, make $50,000.<ep>
   Chain letters (--) a perennial thorn in the side of postal authorities (--) are making a comeback in Florida, consumer officials say.<ep>
   ``What we received in the mail as children was mischievous, but not illegal. Now with money involved, even if it's a small amount, chain letters have been bumped into the scam department,'' said Jody Collins, an assistant attorney general.<ep>
   Chain letters are illegal if they request money or other items of value and promise participants a return. Federal postal authorities can prosecute under lottery and mail fraud laws. Florida officials treat chain letters as an illegal lottery or a deceptive business practice.<ep>
   Typically, a chain letter requires you to send money to five people on a list. Then, you scratch off the name at the top and add yours to the bottom, reproduce the letter, with your name in the sixth position, and mail copies to other people. The number of chain letters mushrooms, your name moves up the list, and people send you money.<ep>
   In some of the letters, consumers are told to buy a mailing list that ranges from $10 to $100.<ep>
   In theory, chain letters work. If everyone who receives the letter mails out copies to five people and those people send out copies, the number of participants would expand exponentially. Thirteen mailings would generate 13,060,694,016 participants. A few mailings later, and the number of shady pen pals would exceed the U.S. population.<ep>
   Scammers make their money by selling the mailing lists or providing fictitious names in the letters. Consumers end up sending the money to the same address or post office box.<ep>
   Though the letters are touted as a legal business opportunity, would-be investors are warned not to include their return address.<ep>
   Any Florida resident with a mailbox or computer may have heard from Dave or David Rhodes. He says that in 1991 he was broke. He had been laid off and his car repossessed.<ep>
   ``In October, 1991, I received a letter in the mail telling me how to earn $50,000 any time I wanted to. Of course I was skeptical, but I was desperate and had nothing to lose. So, I gave it a try (--) today I am rich!!'' the letter reads.<ep>
<m0>An easy million<ql>
<m0>   Rhodes notes that he made $200,000 within months and ``will become a millionaire within the next four to six months.'' He promises that participants will earn $50,000 in 20 to 60 days.<ep>
   What he doesn't tell you is that he plugged the same story in 1989. That means, hypothetically, that he should have made a million dollars by 1991.<ep>
   Nonetheless, consumers believed the rags-to-riches story.<ep>
   ``I thought it sounded pretty good. I got the letter, and ended up investing about $250. I haven't received one single dollar back yet,'' said Diane Ansteatt of St. Petersburg.<ep>
   Ansteatt mailed $1 to the five people on the list. She bought another list of 500 names for $55 from a Fort Lauderdale firm, then made 500 copies and sent them off with her name on the list.<ep>
   ``I was trying to make some money, but I ended up losing money,'' said Ansteatt, a home nurse. ``It's a scam.''<ep>
<m0>Cyber-chains<ql>
<m0>   One electronic chain letter floating in cyberspace is basically a testimony from someone claiming to be the common consumer who has been duped by other schemes before.<ep>
   The person takes a chance (--) ``It only costs $5 and five stamps'' (--) and within eight months, the mailbox is stuffed with letters containing cash from as far away as Australia. The total so far: $23,343.<ep>
   At the end of the pitch, instructions are given on how to participate and repost the letter on electronic bulletin boards. Consumers are urged to spread the word and the wealth.<ep>
   Authorities say the letters usually peter out before they can track them and that finding the people who write the original letters is difficult. And the search is costly.<ep>
<m0>Try the circular file<ql>
<m0>   For example, it would cost state officials about $3,800 for an attorney and investigator just to open one chain-letter case, said CeCe Dykas, who heads the Economic Crime Division in Hollywood.<ep>
   ``We are trying to fight this through education. That is the most effective way,'' Dykas said. ``And consumers should throw them away.''<ep>
   Because of the amount of money involved, few people complain.<ep>
   ``Generally, the threshold is $50,'' Collins said. ``People have to lose about that much before they start complaining.''<ep>
   That consumer thinking only drives the engine of chain letters.<ep>
   ``When they work, it's because people think it's so easy that they have nothing to lose but the $5 and postage,'' Dykas said. ``Unfortunately, chain letters can end up being the beginning of other scams.''<ql>
