   Cecilia Winds worked to put 11 children through school. On Saturday, it was her turn.<P>

   The 55-year-old grandmother graduated from Florida Memorial College with a bachelor's degree in elementary education.<P>

   ``It was hard,'' Winds said. ``But I took every obstacle as a steppingstone.''<P>

   So did the other 180 students who carried a sheepskin off the podium of the historically black college in North Dade.<P>

   Most worked their way through school, with some graduates juggling full-time jobs with night classes. Some had children to tend. Many were the first to attend college in their family.<P>

   So when Florida Memorial President Albert E. Smith announced the beginning of the ceremony to hand out diplomas, a roar came up in the packed auditorium.<P>

   ``We made it,'' senior class President Lexton Symonette exulted in his speech. ``Yes, we did.''<P>

   Replied the audience in one breath: ``Amen.''<P>

   Hundreds of cameras flashed to record the graduates' short walk to the podium. Anthony Williams, 27, carried off his physical education degree with three generations proudly watching: his 4-year-old son, his girlfriend and his mother, who came from Detroit.<P>

   Sen. Bob Graham, the commencement speaker, gave the new grads a dose of optimism: In their lifetime, they'll probably earn double what they would have taken home as high school graduates.<P>

   ``But with these benefits come responsibility,'' he said. ``One is of leadership. Our task is to build a better society.''<P>

   Sherwood Maxine Smith, mother of 4-year-old twins, is already doing that -- as a third-grade teacher at Indian Trace Elementary School in Weston. She won accolades Saturday for graduating with a 3.94 grade point average. Her only B was an American history class. Mischievously, she took a picture of the history professor who kept her from a perfect record. <P>

   ``I just feel blessed,'' she said. ``I worked so hard.''<P>

   So did Demetrius Washington and Carlos Westmore, psychology majors who graduated despite getting suspended once and working to support themselves.<P>

   ``They said we couldn't do it,'' Washington said. ``And here we are.''
