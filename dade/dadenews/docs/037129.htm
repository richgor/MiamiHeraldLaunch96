Campaign on hold until fine paid<BR>
   While Metro Commissioner Maurice Ferre worked the crowd at a recent reception, a friend hauled in some $20,000 in checks for Ferre's bid to become strong Dade mayor.<P>

   But the party was a little premature. State election law says Ferre and his supporters can't collect contributions because he hasn't opened a campaign account. Ferre said the checks will be returned.<P>

   Ferre, former mayor of Miami, is stuck in a Catch-22: He hasn't opened an account yet because he first wants to pay off a decade-old fine for accepting illegal campaign contributions.<P>

   ``This is a Chinese puzzle,'' Ferre said. ``I'm frustrated. You don't think I'm enjoying this?''<P>

   The fund-raiser took place April 19 at the Coral Gables home of Roberto Recio, a nursery owner and longtime friend of Ferre's. <BR>
About half the people there were members of the politically potent Latin Builders Association, Ferre said, although he said it wasn't an official LBA function.<P>

   ``Everybody got an invitation,'' said builder Pedro J. Adrian, who brought along a $500 check. ``All of Miami got an invitation.'' Recio didn't return four phone calls from the Herald.<P>

   When the event was scheduled some weeks ago, Ferre said he thought he would have the fine paid and an account opened. He said he assumed people would bring money along.<P>

   ``Obviously any idiot would know people bring checks to these things,'' Ferre said.<P>

   By party day, Ferre still hadn't paid off the fine. He didn't want to call off the party, either. ``He would have been embarrassed. I would have been upset,'' Ferre said.<P>

   Ferre maintains he didn't know Recio was actually collecting checks for him at the party. He says he never took possession of the checks. ``Recio told me at the end of the evening, `I think we're going to raise $20,000.' I said, `I can't accept that.' ''<P>

   Mike Cochran, assistant general counsel at the state Division of Elections, said candidates aren't held liable for illegal contributions unless they do so intentionally. <P>

    Agreeing to give the money back would work in a candidate's favor, he said.<P>

   ``On the other hand, if you're talking about someone who is a perennial candidate and who knows what the rules are, does that imply some sort of willful behavior?'' Cochran said.<P>

   ``It's a balancing act,'' he said. ``You stack up all the facts on each side of the scale, and see which way it tips.'' The division does not investigate unless it first receives a complaint, he said.<P>

   Ferre still owes $58,000 of an elections fine for illegally accepting campaign contributions to pay debts from a 1981 campaign. Ferre says he'll kick off a campaign for the strong mayor's seat as soon as it's paid off.<P>

   But Ferre says he wants to raise the funds to pay it off himself -- not from his family or friends.

Look for Xavier Suarez at your bus stop<BR>
   Former Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez is taking his mayoral campaign to the streets. Actually, to the bus stop.<P>

   Suarez has been hanging around Metrorail platforms and bus stops from Okeechobee Road to Kendall to Little Havana, handing out cards to riders. They read: ``If you support a 50-cent reduction in Metrorail and Metrobus fares, vote Xavier L. Suarez.''<P>

   ``They're amazed to see he's there,'' said his campaign coordinator, Javier Marques. ``What he wants is to reach the everyday voters, the people who use the system.''<P>

   The low-budget technique is part of a campaign strategy for Suarez, who hopes to persuade voters that he's the candidate of the common people. His opponent for the Dade mayor's seat, Metro Commissioner Alex Penelas, has a large and growing funding advantage.<P>

   Suarez said he's hearing a lot about the <BR>
system's inconveniences and high costs. He says nobody expects to see a politician at a Metrorail platform.<P>

   ``I get a lot of double takes,'' he said.

<H2>City's arena legal bill hits $36,947</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   Billable hours are starting to stack up in the Miami Arena negotiations.<P>

   Miami city commissioners had set a limit on expenses for outside attorney M. Ronald Krongold, who was hired to negotiate a possible buyout of arena operators, Decoma Miami Associates.<P>

   The limit: $10,000. The bill that arrived this week: $36,947.<P>

   No deal has been struck. Though the city had offered Decoma $14 million to take over management of the downtown arena, the negotiations fell apart.<P>

   But fees so far have piled up for legal research, telephone conferences and draft revisions. Krongold's fee: $200 an hour. For example, he charged $400 to spend two hours at a March City Commission meeting.<P>

   Krongold didn't return phone messages to his Coral Gables office on Friday.<P>

   City Manager Cesar Odio said the bill will have to go back before the City Commission for approval, a loophole proposed by Mayor Steve Clark, though it was supposed to be approved before it was spent.<P>

   ``If he did the work, we have to pay him,'' Odio said. ``There were a lot of documents.''<BR>
<P>

   City of Miami reporter Joanne Cavanaugh contributed to this report.<P>
