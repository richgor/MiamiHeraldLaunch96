   The annual Metro budget struggles began in earnest Tuesday as advocates for social programs pleaded with commissioners to protect the poor from cuts in funding.<ep>
  A proposed $4.2 billion county budget for next year keeps spending basically intact for most social services (--) programs that feed the elderly, prepare young children for school and help immigrants find jobs and homes. Some advocates say that's not enough. They want the county to boost funding to help make up for state and federal budget cuts.<ep>
  ``So far, the county commission and staff have their fingers in the hole of this dike, but the dam is about to break,'' said Daniella Levine, executive director of the Dade County Human Services Coalition, an advocacy group.<ep>
  This year's proposed budget would keep taxes roughly the same for most homeowners. That would leave little room for new programs or increases in current ones. For instance, the county may not replace $594,000 in expected federal funding cuts for the Beckham Hall homeless shelter. That's nearly 60 percent of the agency's budget.<ep>
  Metro budget directors have set aside a $4 million cushion to plug the biggest holes. Commissioners will decide where to put that money after two budget hearings in September.<ep>
  Commissioner James Burke, bucking a strong anti-tax sentiment on the commission, said the county should not pursue tax cuts if those cuts will hurt the poor.<ep>
  ``It's only going to get worse,'' Burke said. ``There's no way we'll be able to roll taxes back and keep the same services.''<ql>
