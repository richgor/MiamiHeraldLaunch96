   State road planners Wednesday disclosed more details about a controversial study to widen the Airport Expressway to 10 lanes (--) possibly razing along the way many homes and buildings on the south side of the highway.<ep>
   If carried out, the project could conceivably affect (--) among other properties (--) the new Salvation Army Area Command at 1907 Northwest 38th Street and Miami Jackson Senior High School at 1751 NW 36th St.<ep>
   The project surprised Dade County transportation planners who were under the impression that they had only authorized the Florida Department of Transportation to add two lanes to the six-lane expressway (--) not four.<ep>
   ``We may have to amend our plans now to accommodate this,'' Jose Luis Mesa, the staff director for the Metropolitan Planning Organization, told state planners after he heard their presentation.<ep>
   Discussion of the study came as an extraordinary item on the agenda of the regular monthly meeting of the Transportation Planning Technical Advisory Committee, an MPO unit.<ep>
   Mesa summoned DOT planners after he read an account of the project April 21 in The Herald's Neighbors section. The article was based on discussion at a public meeting in Allapattah where DOT planners outlined the project.<ep>
   As late as Dec. 7, 1995, Metro commissioners approved a long-range transportation plan that included the State Road 112 project, but its scope was only one new lane in each direction.<ep>
   Those lanes would be for car-poolers and would connect with existing Interstate 95 car-pool lanes running north from 112 to the south Palm Beach county community of Delray Beach.<ep>
   Bill Evans, the state DOT manager for the 112 project, told The Herald on Wednesday that what was approved in December was based on outdated traffic data from the 1980s.<ep>
   Evans said preliminary findings in a new traffic analysis showed that two car-pool lanes would no longer be ``satisfactory.''<ep>
   As a result, Evans said, planners are now looking at adding four lanes, two in each direction.<ep>
   What is undecided, Evans said, is whether all four lanes should be for car-poolers (--) two or more people a vehicle (--) or whether two should be for general use including solo drivers.<ep>
   At this point, Evans said, the project is merely a preliminary study. This means no date has been set for final design or construction, which could be years down the road.<ep>
   Talk of the project has caused concern among residents whose homes line the south side of the expressway. That's the side that would be affected, since Metrorail would preclude expansion on the north side.<ep>
   Maude Newbold, an Allapattah neighbor, has a special interest in stopping the project. Construction of I-95 in the early 1960s forced her family to leave Overtown.<ep>
   ``It sounds like history repeating itself,'' Newbold said. ``It's very upsetting.''<ep>
