   It doesn't matter how you look at the James E. Scott Homes on Northwest 22nd Avenue. The view is pretty much the same from any angle: a stream of barracks-style, two-story beige apartments, each with a clunky steel clothesline in the back yard.<P>

   The design, as familiar as McDonald's golden arches and as plain as white bread, has come to symbolize the stigma of cramped, no-frills public housing.<P>

   Now Metropolitan Dade Housing and Urban Development wants to change that perception. It wants to give Scott Homes, 7226 NW 22nd Ave., a $16.5 million face lift, reconfiguring the 38-year-old property to add a sense of privacy and community. About $5.5 million would go toward infrastructure repairs to sewer and water lines at the sprawling 44-acre development. The rest would go toward beautifying the buildings' facade.<P>

    Decorative columns would dress up the round, steel front-porch beams. Bahama shutters would cover all second-floor windows. The shed-style porch roofs would give way to more angular designs. Nine vehicle entrance and exit points would be reduced to three. And residential parking, now in the rear of some units, would be switched to the front along new one-way streets.<P>

   Metro HUD director Greg Byrne said it's the most exciting project he has undertaken at the agency.<P>

    ``This will not only dramatically transform the property, but it could have enormous impact on an entire area by restoring a sense of community,'' Byrne said. ``Right now, driving up 22nd Avenue and seeing the butt end of those buildings is pretty foreboding for most people. We want to break up that monotony and institutional character.''<BR>
   Several Scott residents familiar with the proposal were also enthusiastic.<P>

   ``Now that's what you call Scott Homes,'' resident Joyce McMath said of the renovation plans. ``This is Scott Projects. There's a big difference. I think people would take care of the [renovated] property and appreciate it because this is all they've had for so long. We could use a change of scenery around here.''<P>

   Bruno Ramos, a principal in the architectural firm of Bruno-Elias & Associates which designed the improvements, said that's exactly what they had in mind.<P>

   ``We think the improvements will give the residents a sense of identity with each unit,'' Ramos said. ``We really wanted to give them a sense of ownership.''<BR>
   End porches, a small covered porch accessible only from the ground-floor living room, will be added to buildings facing internal streets and open spaces. All back porches will receive a gable-style roof with utility lighting.<P>

   All back yards would be lighted from the building with a photocell-controlled system that comes on when anyone approaches. Lighting along the front walkway would be photocell-controlled and supplemented with personally controlled porch lighting.<P>

   Additional palm trees would be added along the streets to soften the appearance while providing an unobstructed pedestrian view of the area.<P>

   Byrne decided to seek federal funding for the project after realizing infrastructure repairs would have to be done anyway at Scott. If the funds aren't available, HUD will consider doing the project in phases, or doing one section and possibly making the units available as privately-owned town homes.<BR>
   Later this month, HUD officials will discuss the project with Scott residents and in June, with the larger community. Byrne hopes to know by October if federal funding can be secured. The pot of federal money he's shooting for is earmarked specifically for improving federal housing projects.<P>

 Byrnes feels the department's improved management, their track record for innovation and the modest amount being sought -- $8 million to $10 million -- gives them a good shot at having the request approved. The department hopes to begin the improvements in November.
