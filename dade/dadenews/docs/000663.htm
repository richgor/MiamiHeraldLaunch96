   Dade County public school students have bumped up their scores on the Stanford Achievement Test for the sixth year in a row, with the youngest reaching levels competitive with the rest of the nation.<P>

   Elementary school children here ranked at the same level or higher than their peers around the nation on the math portion of the exam. At the top of the scale, second-graders scored an average 22 points above the national median in math computation.<P>

   The early results, released Tuesday, were not as encouraging in reading. Scores improved in the early grades, but still fell short of the national median.<P>

   Ecstatic educators credit the young students' success to preschool intervention programs like Head Start and prekindergarten, as well as an onslaught of learning programs introduced in Dade elementary schools in the early '90s. <P>

   The programs focus on one-on-one or small group tutoring, the kind of attention experts say is needed, especially in a school system like Dade's, where more than half the students live below the poverty level.<P>

   The vast improvements left behind one trouble spot: middle schools.<BR>
 <BR>
<P>

   Reading scores there were unchanged compared with last year's. Math computation scores among eighth-graders dropped three percentile points, the only countywide setback.<P>

   ``Middle school is still stuck,'' Superintendent Octavio Visiedo said. ``Obviously, I'm not pleased about that.<P>

   ``But we've been really concentrating on the early grades and we're making substantive gains there. What this says is that test results are going to continue to improve over the years because we're building a stronger foundation.''<P>

   The Stanford is considered one of the most important tests taken by Dade public school students. It's used to compare students here with other children of the same age around the nation. <P>

   The state also uses Stanford results in grades four and eight to decide if schools should be placed on a ``critically low-scoring'' list. Fifty-two Dade schools were placed on the list this school year for falling behind in math, reading and writing. They could face sanctions that include faculty changes if they don't improve in three years.<P>

   Administrators hope to have school and student results ready by the end of the school year.<P>

   This is the sixth year Dade has used the same version of the Stanford, which some experts warn can skew results. If a school system uses the same test for a long period, its curriculum can sometimes mimic it.<P>

Critics' complaints<P>

   Although teachers don't have the exact questions, they're familiar with the type asked. Critics of standardized testing complain teachers are often pressured to ``teach to the test,'' with students memorizing responses, rather than learning.<P>

   ``There is a period of time when we'll have to look at the scores and decide if it's time to change the test,'' said Deputy Superintendent Marilyn Neff, who oversees Dade's testing office. ``I don't think we're at a point yet where change is necessary.<P>

   ``There's a danger in changing the test too many times, too. We don't want to confuse people because this test emphasizes the material we feel is important.''<P>

   The Stanford is a norm-referenced test, which means the scores of students here are compared to the scores of a national sampling of children who took the same test. The exam is scored on a scale of 1 to 100, with 50 the national median.<P>

   The test is often called the SAT, not to be confused with the college entrance exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test. The college test has undergone radical changes in recent years, including a controversial inflation of its scoring system.<P>

Steady improvements<P>

   On the Stanford, which has not changed its scoring system, Dade elementary schools have been making steady improvements since 1991, especially in math.<P>

   The highest average scores this year were turned in by first- and second-graders, whose math computation results hit the 71st and 72nd percentiles, respectively.<P>

   In contrast, progress in sixth, seventh and eight grades has been stagnant for the most part, with some mild dips since 1991. Middle school students had the lowest median scores in Dade this year, with sixth-graders ducking as low as the 36th percentile in reading.<P>

   High school sophomores and seniors are exempt from taking the test because they have other state-required exams.<P>

   Non-English speaking students in the beginning two levels of English as a Second Language classes, as well as many students with learning disabilities, do not have their scores included in the countywide results.
