<m0>   For Lauren Comander, managing editor of The Panther, writing newspaper articles isn't enough. She spends a lot of time helping those who cannot read.<ep>
   Comander, a volunteer intern for The Herald's Neighbors section, discovered how devastating loss of sight can be for anyone who loves reading. Her grandmother lost part of her sight when Comander was a sophomore. All she had were books on tape.<ep>
   That experience encouraged her to volunteer with Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic, which puts textbooks on audiotape for the visually impaired.<ep>
   ``The work Lauren does involves teamwork and great attention to detail to ensure that the recordings are produced with the greatest degree of accuracy and `listenability,' '' said the organization's assistant director Kathleen Craynock.<ep>
