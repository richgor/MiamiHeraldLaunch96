   The little boy who is charged with murder and can't stop crying over it went to detention school Thursday. But he could not concentrate.<P>

   Because, about the same time Thursday, a team of concerned lawyers, investigators and one judge were trying to decide what to do with the alleged child killer.<P>

   ``You don't like charging a child with murder,'' said Metro-Dade homicide detective Gus Bayas, the lead investigator. ``For an 11-year-old to be facing this is difficult.''<P>

   Bayas looked uneasy discussing the arrest. So did prosecutor Audrey Frank-Aponte and her opponents, Dade Assistant Public Defenders Leo Succar and Frederick Bragdon.<P>

   ``A real tragedy,'' Bragdon said. ``Two lives ruined.''<P>

   On Thursday, Circuit Judge Jerald Bagley ordered a psychological evaluation for the boy. The judge also scheduled a hearing for next Friday, when results of the evaluation will be presented.<P>

   For now, the boy will remain housed with 13 other youths inside the psychological wing at the Juvenile Detention Center. He will attend school at the center, where instructors will test his reading and math skills and try to help him cope.<P>

   ``He does a lot of crying,'' said one detention center worker, who did not want to be identified. ``He's a small boy in stature with some adult-sized problems.''<P>

   Bayas arrested the boy Wednesday -- a day after he allegedly picked up a shotgun and blasted his 9-year-old cousin dead.<P>

   Khadejah Bolden, the rambunctious cousin, apparently had been taunting the boy about his clothes and grabbing at them. A slug ended the taunts.<P>

   He is charged with second-degree murder, becoming one of the youngest people ever to be charged with a homicide in Dade.<P>

   Now the adults are left to sort out the mess.<P>

   It started with the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. It removed a 15-year-old boy and two girls, age 3 and 6, from the home where the shooting occurred. They were relocated with an aunt.<P>

   Prosecutors and public defenders are trying to negotiate the proper settlement, but seem uneasy with the entire episode.<P>

   This isn't the typical clear-cut case found in Youth Hall, where the defendants are older and loaded with scores of prior arrests.<P>

   By law, if the boy is tried in juvenile court and convicted, he probably would be free by his 19th birthday.<P>

   If a grand jury indicts him for murder, and he is tried and convicted as an adult, he could face life in prison -- although this is unlikely given his age, intense remorse and family background. His mother is dead, and his father rarely around.<P>

   But in the long run, finding the right mix of detention and treatment may be difficult, warned Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle.<P>

   ``One of the great indictments of the juvenile justice system is there are an insufficient number and types of programs that work for juvenile offenders,'' Rundle said.
