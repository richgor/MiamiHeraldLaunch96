Martinez<ue5><ql>
<ep>
<m0>   After the first two corruption trials against Raul Martinez boiled down to jury instructions, federal prosecutors took extra care Monday to spell out what they wanted jurors to hear this time.<ep>
   Led by U.S. Attorney Kendall Coffey, prosecutors persuaded Senior U.S. District Judge James <m4>Martinez<m2><ql>
<m0>Kehoe to emphasize this point: Circumstantial evidence alone is enough to convict the Hialeah mayor on 6-year-old extortion and racketeering charges.<ep>
   The conviction reached in Martinez's first trial was overturned, in part because of faulty jury instructions. Prosecutors said Monday that they believe jurors in the second trial deadlocked 11-1 because their instructions led them astray.<ep>
   Jurors should be told explicit agreements can be implied through actions and need not be verbally expressed, prosecutors said.<ep>
   ``Corruption is not always stated, it's not always verbalized,'' Coffey argued. ``If you have to spell it out in words and terms, it becomes an impossible burden for the government to prove.''<ep>
   Defense attorney Jose Quin~on was flabbergasted that prosecutors would use the word ``implied'' to try to clarify explicit. The two words are antonyms, he objected, and surely would confuse jurors.<ep>
   ``The nature of the agreement has to be explicit,'' Quin~on said. ``What prosecutors want to do is undermine the definition of an explicit agreement because they don't like the rule of law.''<ep>
   ``It's just not right to make up the rules again for the government (--) to reshuffle the deck,'' he added.<ep>
   Martinez was convicted on six of eight corruption charges in 1991. But appellate judges ordered a new trial in 1994, citing flawed jury instructions and flagrant jury misconduct. The mayor's second trial ended March 26 in a hung jury. The third trial began April 22.<ep>
   After nearly two hours of debate on the murky point of law, Kehoe accepted a definition of extortion that left out the word ``implied.'' Instead, it stated that explicit agreements need not be verbally expressed and could be proved through circumstantial evidence.<ep>
   During jury selection, prosecutors Richard Gregorie and Bruce Udolf planted the seed that their case against Martinez is based solely on circumstantial evidence. Prosecutors are expected to heavily cultivate that premise today during closing arguments.<ep>
   Martinez never has denied netting more than $134,000 from Hialeah land deals during the 1980s. But he has said the deals were legal (--) the fruits of his business savvy and rising political stock.<ep>
   Quin~on is expected to argue today that even government witnesses testified the mayor never extorted money for zoning approval.<ql>
