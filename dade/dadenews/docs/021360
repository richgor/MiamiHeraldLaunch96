<m0>   It has been 34 years since Jose Goyos arrived in Florida alone, a 9-year-old boy spirited out of Cuba in the Pedro Pan exodus.<ep>
   Yet only in the last several years has he begun to understand what it all meant for the thousands of Cuban children who were sent to live in the United States.<ep>
   For most of the past decade, Goyos has been studying how the Pedro Pan children have fared in the United States. On Friday, along with hundreds of other Barry University students, Goyos graduated, earning a doctorate in social work.<ep>
   ``It's a population that was very much at risk, not knowing the language, not knowing the culture, not having any family,'' said Goyos, 43, the first student to march across the stage Friday afternoon at the Miami Beach Convention Center.<ep>
   Though not exactly a Pedro Pan child, Maria Puig, who also received a doctorate in social work, arrived in the United States under similar circumstances. <ep>
   Alarmed at the turn of events in Cuba, her parents, on just a day's notice, put her and her brother, age 5 and 8, aboard a Pan Am jet bound for the United States in 1962.<ep>
   ``I watched them waving goodbye to me, and that's when I realized that they were staying,'' she recalled. ``I started crying.''<ep>
   She and her brother ended up in an Ohio boarding school, where they stayed for two years until their mother finally made it to the United States. Puig's father escaped Cuba six months later and was picked up by the U.S. Coast Guard in the Florida Straits. Reunited, the family lived first in Cleveland and later in Tallahassee and Miami.<ep>
   Early on, Puig wanted to be a lawyer like her mother or a doctor like her father. But before she headed too far down that road, she began working at social service agencies and then at Florida International University's School of Social Work.<ep>
   A few years ago, she decided to cap it off with a doctorate. She enrolled at Barry and has spent the past three years examining the migration of Cubans during the past 30 years. It is a study that is about more than Cuban children.<ep>
   ``I think that it has tremendous implications for other refugee children that may be coming to this country and are coming to this country,'' she said.<ep>
   When Barry's president, Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, delivered the commencement address, she knew she was talking to people like Goyos and Puig, people with a lot behind them and a lot in front of them.<ep>
   ``I know this: The world is better today because you have been here, and you will be there,'' said O'Laughlin, 67, who is celebrating her 50th year as a nun. ``We have shared the same mission, done the same journey, and it has just begun again.''<ep>
