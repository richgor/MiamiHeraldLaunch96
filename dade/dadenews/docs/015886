  They came to Miami International Airport bearing grief and a question they were afraid to have answered.<ep>
  Carrying babies and even herding dogs on a leash (--) their stoicism belying the chaos that suddenly had beset their lives (--) friends and relatives of some of the passengers aboard ValuJet Flight 592 were quickly ushered past the ticket counter Saturday afternoon by Metro-Dade police and airport personnel.<ep>
  Often walking arm in arm, finding strength in groups of three and four, they were led up back stairs seldom seen by travelers and ushered into a third-floor auditorium on Concourse B that in times such as these becomes the airport's crisis center.<ep>
  ``Please, my husband was on that plane. Please, my husband was on that plane,'' one woman repeated time and time again.<ep>
   A ValuJet official with a passenger list from the DC-9 that crashed earlier in the afternoon waited just inside the auditorium door. Some people would go no farther.<ep>
   ``They told us he was on the plane,'' Barbara Varcelo cried out as she and her mother spun around just inside the door. ``But they haven't told us anything.''<ep>
   Barbara Varcelo's grandfather, Alberto Varcelo, 60, of Hialeah, had been flying to Atlanta.<ep>
   Metro-Dade police crisis counselors and volunteers from the American Red Cross and Salvation Army awaited family members inside. They could offer coffee, soft drinks, sandwiches and cookies, and a bank of phones (--) but little the families could really use.<ep>
    At any one time, 10 or 20 people waited for any glimmer of hope they sensed would never come.<ep>
    ``We saw the pictures on television,'' one man said. ``We know there's no hope.''<ep>
    There was no television in the crisis room.<ql>
