<m0>    Two suspected burglars hid in a <m0>West Kendall <m0>house for more than two hours Sunday while police surrounded the place.<ep>
   It started at 10 a.m. when a neighbor called saying there appeared to be a break-in in the 10000 block of Southwest 144th Avenue. Police arrived to discover someone had broken in through the back.<ep>
   Metro-Dade police dogs had another discovery: Someone was in the attic. <ep>
   The SWAT team was called out to force the burglars out, but after several hours, the suspects came out willingly. A 16-year-old and an 18-year-old were charged with burglary. Their names were not available Sunday.<ep>
   Police spokesman Juan Del Castillo said SWAT was called because police saw rifles among the possessions the alleged burglars had stacked up at the door to steal. ``We didn't know if maybe they had a gun there that they took and slipped into their waistband,'' Del Castillo said.<ql>
