<m0>   A Dade County Corrections Department bus carrying 31 prisoners broke down on the Dolphin Expressway at rush hour Thursday afternoon causing westbound traffic to be stopped about a half-hour.<ep>
   The vehicle, part of a five-bus caravan, was heading from the Dade County Jail at 1321 NW 13th St. to the Dade County Stockade at 3950 NW 41st St. A fire in the air-conditioning system caused it to stop at 5:25 p.m.<ep>
   ``The bus filled with smoke, but the officer from that bus and the officers from the other buses got the windows down and the smoke disappeared,'' said corrections spokeswoman Janelle Hall. ``The prisoners were already handcuffed, and they all stayed on the bus.''<ep>
   They were attended by Dade County Fire Rescue for possible smoke inhalation and the medical staff at the stockade was still examining some of the prisoners late Thursday. There did not appear to be any serious injuries.<ep>
   The Dolphin was closed in both directions about 10 minutes, according to a state Department of Transportation employee. The eastbound lane was opened first and the westbound lane opened again about 6 p.m., he said, after the prisoners were loaded onto another bus and headed for the stockade.<ep>
   Hall said the prisoners on the bus were in jail for a variety of felonies and misdemeanors.<ep>
