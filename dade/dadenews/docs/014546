<m0>   America's top general in the War on AIDS saw the faces of an epidemic Wednesday in Miami, and they wore expressions of defiance and determination and desperation.<ep>
   They live on the front lines, their enemy so tiny it can nestle on the tip of a needle.<ep>
   There was Charlie Lillis, demanding to know why drug companies charge so much. And Julia Llorente, beseeching the AIDS czar and her consorts to do more for women and children stricken by the killer. And Torchia Samuels, who did not know the meaning of life until confronted with death.<ep>
   ``Let me tell you something about AIDS,'' said Samuels, 44, voice rising and falling with the passion of a preacher. ``AIDS is not a dreadful punishment but a God-sent blessing. It makes you want to live. Once, I wanted to commit suicide. But something just said to me, `You don't want to die now. You want to fight. You want to be alive.' ''<ep>
   She drove 66 miles, from Homestead to Little River, to deliver her epistle to Patricia S. Fleming, director of the Office of National AIDS policy.<ep>
   Fleming is traversing the nation, scribbling notes on small scraps of paper, dispensing equal doses of hope and reality. She spent Tuesday and Wednesday in Broward and Dade counties, greeted by crowds totaling nearly 400 during three Miami stops.<ep>
   She met Samuels at the Center for Haitian Studies, in a storefront stretching along Northeast Second Avenue. Samuels' story drew tears, leaving the people from Washington, who usually have so much to say, speechless.<ep>
   ``We are people living with a dying disease,'' Samuels said, ``and we don't have time to wait for you to decide which way your policy is going to fall.''<ep>
   ``That,'' said Fleming, ``is why we're here. In Washington, we're policy and process people, but we care. We came to listen.''<ep>
   And so they did, their longest (--) and largest (--) assembly at the Miami Museum of Science. There, more than 250 people filled every seat, and more, of an auditorium where the Washington entourage was flanked by colorful panels from the AIDS quilt.<ep>
   With the recent expedited approval of a series of powerful AIDS drugs, patients wanted to know: Why does it cost so much to get something that could save my life?<ep>
   ``And what,'' Lillis, who's on the board of the People with AIDS Coalition of Dade, wanted to know, ``can the federal government do to curb the profitmaking of the drug companies?''<ep>
   Government's ability to control those costs, Fleming and the other AIDS experts said, is limited. Instead, Scott Hitt, the Los Angeles doctor who's chairman of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS, offered this advice:<ep>
   ``The most effective way to get costs down is to get out there and yell and scream,'' Hitt said. ``That's what the drug companies are going to listen to.''<ep>
