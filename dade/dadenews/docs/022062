<m0>   A controversy that once threatened to remove the Venetian Causeway from the National Register of Historic Places was finally resolved Thursday, ensuring that the 70-year-old roadway will remain a landmark.<ep>
   A Metro transportation board gave project managers the green light to award a $17 million contract to build a new drawbridge near the mainland.<ep>
   The contract and a recent letter from the U.S. Department of the Interior, approving changes to the West Bascule Bridge design, put to rest the sensitive issue.<ep>
   Last year, the project stalled when the U.S. Coast Guard objected to the restoration of the drawbridge at its current height of five <m1> <m0>feet eight <m1> <m0>inches. The Coast Guard wanted the drawbridge rebuilt at a much greater height (--) 21 feet (--) to reduce the number of bridge openings.<ep>
   A compromise was reached in November under which the bridge height would be raised to 12 feet. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Left unresolved was how planners would pay for construction of the new drawbridge. Design changes raised costs from the original $13 million to $17 million.<ep>
   Jose Abreu, the Florida DOT district secretary in Dade, on Thursday won unanimous approval from the county's Metropolitan Planning Organization to proceed with the project.<ep>
   Although the project is state-funded and designed, DOT needed local endorsement because Dade has to readjust its road and structure plans to accommodate the new project.<ep>
   Abreu said the contract could go out as early as next month.<ep>
   Meanwhile, Daniel H. Aronson, president of the Venetian Islands Homeowners Association, disclosed that on March 6 the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places confirmed that design changes were consistent with the causeway's historic designation.<ep>
   ``The Venetian Causeway will still be able to convey its significance as an essential element in the creation of the Venetian islands community in the 1920s,'' Carol D. Shull, the Keeper, wrote to George F. Percy, director of Florida's Division of Historical Resources.<ep>
   ``We're extremely proud and pleased that we were able to get the final blessing from the National Register,'' Aronson said.<ep>
