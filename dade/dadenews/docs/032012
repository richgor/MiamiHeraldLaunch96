   Cecilia Winds worked to put 11 children through school. On Saturday, it was her turn.<ep>
   The 55-year-old grandmother graduated from Florida Memorial College with a bachelor's degree in elementary education.<ep>
   ``It was hard,'' Winds said. ``But I took every obstacle as a steppingstone.''<ep>
   So did the other 180 students who carried a sheepskin off the podium of the historically black college in North Dade.<ep>
   Most worked their way through school, with some graduates juggling full-time jobs with night classes. Some had children to tend. Many were the first to attend college in their family.<ep>
   So when Florida Memorial President Albert E. Smith announced the beginning of the ceremony to hand out diplomas, a roar came up in the packed auditorium.<ep>
   ``We made it,'' senior class President Lexton Symonette exulted in his speech. ``Yes, we did.''<ep>
   Replied the audience in one breath: ``Amen.''<ep>
   Hundreds of cameras flashed to record the graduates' short walk to the podium. Anthony Williams, 27, carried off his physical education degree with three generations proudly watching: his 4-year-old son, his girlfriend and his mother, who came from Detroit.<ep>
   Sen. Bob Graham, the commencement speaker, gave the new grads a dose of optimism: In their lifetime, they'll probably earn double what they would have taken home as high school graduates.<m1><ep>
<m0>   ``But with these benefits come responsibility,'' he said. ``One is of leadership. Our task is to build a better society.''<ep>
   Sherwood Maxine Smith, mother of 4-year-old twins, is already doing that (--) as a third-grade teacher at Indian Trace Elementary School in Weston. She won accolades Saturday for graduating with a 3.94 grade point average. Her only <m0>B <m0>was an American history class. Mischievously, she took a picture of the history professor who kept her from a perfect record. <ep>
   ``I just feel blessed,'' she said. ``I worked so hard.''<ep>
   So did Demetrius Washington and Carlos Westmore, psychology majors who graduated despite getting suspended once and working to support themselves.<ep>
   ``They said we couldn't do it,'' Washington said. ``And here we are.''<ep>
