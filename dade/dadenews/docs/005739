    VERO BEACH (--) Florida's eighth area code (--) 561 (--) <m1> <m0>kicks in Monday from Palm Beach County through the Treasure Coast.<ep>
    Blame it on the incredible explosion of mobile phones, teenagers' phones, beepers, custom calling, faxes and home computers with those modems that speed people across the Internet to instant communications with folks on the other side of the planet.<ep>
    ``There just aren't enough numbers to go around,'' said Buck Passmore, BellSouth's Palm Beach regional spokesman.<ep>
    The maximum array of seven-number combinations in an area code is about 7.6 million, Passmore said. The current 407 area code was pushing 7.3 million.<ep>
    That's more than two lines for every man, woman and child living in 407.<ep>
    The four-county area of Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River, plus a tiny sliver of southern Brevard, will have an estimated 1.4 million users in 1996 and 1.6 million by 2001.<ep>
    Orange County, which will remain the hub of the 407 area code, has about 1.75 million customers now and by 2001 there will be 1.96 million, phone company experts estimate.<ep>
    Florida had three area codes from 1947 to 1988: 305 for South Florida; 813 for Central and Southwestern Florida, and 904 for North Florida. The 407 code was born in 1988, then last year came 941 in southwestern Florida, 954 in Broward County, and 352 in the Gainesville area.<ep>
    Orlando could have another area code by the turn of the century and the Palm Beach/Treasure Coast may get another one in less than a decade.<ep>
    The state's seventh area code is already up and running in nine counties around Gainesville in north central Florida, where 352 has replaced the old area code. <ep>
   On May 3 in west Central Florida, 941 became mandatory for about half the customers in what used to be 813 territory.<ep>
    In an effort to minimize the impact, particularly for people who must reprint advertising and stationery to reflect the new area code, the old one will work until April 13, 1997, Passmore said, so callers can use either 407 or 561.<ep>
     There were 16 new area codes in 1995, affecting 20 million of the 150 million phone numbers in the country, said Brian Cravins of Sprint. With 15 more area codes scheduled to go into effect this year, he said, ``The public is getting accustomed to changing its long-distance dialing habits.''<ep>
