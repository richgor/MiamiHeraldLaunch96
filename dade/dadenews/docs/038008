<m0>   Before ValuJet Flight 592 plunged into the Everglades, the short stretch of Tamiami Trail near the edge of the Miccosukee Indian Reservation was a tranquil haven for bass fishermen working the L67 canal that parallels the highway to Naples.<ep>
   But an hour after the crash, tranquillity vanished with a rush of rescue workers and newspaper, television and radio reporters. With them came TV antennas, mobile phones and long-range cameras.<ep>
   CNN, Time, Newsweek and The Washington Post were among the national news organizations that descended on the scene along with a host of local media.<ep>
   Metro-Dade Fire Rescue and aviation officials moved quickly to establish a command center on a levee north of the highway, about 10 miles west of Krome Avenue and six to eight miles south of the crash site, where they briefed the media every 30 minutes. It was there that the victims were expected to be brought before being taken to a morgue.<ep>
   A levee perpendicular to the canal and highway quickly became a parking lot for ambulances, police cars, fuel trucks and bulldozers sitting atop flatbed trucks. Lining both sides of the highway, firefighters, reporters and airboat operators waited for word of survivors and the conditions of victims.<ep>
   As dusk approached, they had no news.<ep>
   On the south side of the highway, a forest of eight to 10 television antennas and satellite dishes sprang up to share the paucity of news about the crash and the likelihood of survivors.<ep>
   From time to time, a white and green Metro-Dade Fire Rescue helicopter landed beside the canal. But shortly before sundown, no bodies had been brought to the command center.<ep>
   As the sun went down over the Everglades, an alligator surfaced in the canal next to the levee, seemingly joining the vigil.<ql>
