<m0>  TALLAHASSEE (--) As a traditional drop of a handkerchief marked an end to the legislative session at 2 a.m. Saturday, there was jubilation and relief on the faces of those who represent Dade's interests.<ep>
  Miami Heat lobbyist Billy Rubin was radiant.<ep>
  At the last possible moment, an economic development plan passed. It has a $60 million sales tax rebate to help build a new arena for the team.<ep>
  Education lobbyists especially were smiling.<ep>
  ``We're better off than last year,'' said Deputy Superintendent Tom Cerra of the Dade County public schools, which get a 2 percent spending hike. <m1><ep>
<m0>  The losers: those who receive social services. Such spending took a $180 million hit statewide to beef up education dollars in a no-new-taxes budget.<ep>
  Anita Bock, chief of the Health and Rehabilitative Services district that covers Dade, estimates that the cuts will translate into big Dade losses:<ep>
  (box) $1.28 million from health services.<ep>
  (box) $1.7 million from community mental health spending.<ep>
  (box) $2.4 million from children's and family programs.<ep>
  (box) $6.8 million from developmental services for the disabled.<ep>
  (box) $8.5 million from costs to administer welfare programs.<ep>
  ``The most devastating cut by far is the one to people with disabilities,'' Bock said. ``That's astonishing in a time when they're telling us we should take people out of institutions.'' <m1><ep>
<m0>  But the budget is also liberally peppered with money for Dade: for colleges and universities, for parks and cultural groups, for meals for the elderly and roads.<ep>
  It didn't hurt that Dade has lawmakers in powerful places.<ep>
  Sen. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-West Dade, is Senate Ways and Means chairman. Reps. Beryl Roberts-Burke, D-Miami, and Rudy Garcia, R-Hialeah, hold leadership posts on the House budget-writing committee.<ep>
  One big-ticket item that Dade lawmakers and lobbyists brought home: $1,375,000 for a new juvenile justice assessment center.<ep>
  But Dade can be most thankful that annual budget tussles pitting urban school districts against rural ones didn't hurt the county. Dade public schools will have $95.5 million in new money. <m1><ep>
<m0>  They also may get a chance to use lottery dollars to build new schools.<ep>
  Late Friday, lawmakers passed a bill spearheaded by Diaz-Balart and Garcia. It says districts can take 5 percent of their lottery money each year for five years and use it for school construction bonds.<ep>
  In Dade, five years of lottery income adds up to $20 million.<ep>
  That would get the district about $100 million in bonds, enough to build 50 new schools. <m1><ep>
<m0>  But before Dade can use the money (--) or any money in the new budget (--) the proposal must make it past the desk of Gov. Lawton Chiles.<ep>
  Chiles' budget director Bob Bradley isn't so sure it will.<ep>
  ``Lottery money is not necessarily the best source because legislators change the way it's spent from year to year,'' Bradley said. ``We have to see how national bond-rating agencies view that as a bonding source.''<ep>
