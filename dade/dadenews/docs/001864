  The first round of the competition to build a major black-owned hotel on South Beach was narrowly won Wednesday by a team that proposes a 330-room, $56 million Hyatt by the ocean.<ep>
   ``I'm elated to be building the first major African-American hotel in the United States,'' said Eugene Jackson, one of the principals of the winning team and <m1> <m0>chairman of Unity Broadcasting Network. ``They don't exist otherwise. This is it.''<ep>
 The decisive factor in favor of the Hyatt plan was its design, which allowed it to edge out a Crowne Plaza proposal that had financial advantages.<ep>
   The city of Miami Beach, which sponsored the competition, is offering $10 million in incentives for the project. The idea for a black-owned hotel grew out of the black tourism boycott and the 20-point accord that settled it in 1993.<ep>
   On Wednesday, a five-member city review panel ranked the seven hotel proposals submitted by black teams, basing their decisions on the architecture, financial viability and how much the hotel would pay to rent the city-owned site. The City Commission, which must approve the review panel's decision, is expected to vote next month.<ep>
   ``The commission is inclined to respect the panel's decision, but I'm sure there will be more examination of the top bidders,'' said City Commissioner Neisen Kasdin. ``The voting, I understand, was very close.''<ep>
   In fact, Crowne Plaza's second-ranked proposal lost by just one point. That team, led by R. Donahue Peebles, a Washington, D.C., real estate developer, proposed a 252-room, $30 million hotel.<ep>
   ``I thought we had it,'' Peebles said. ``We are better in terms of African-American ownership, the financing and the return to the city. As far as architecture (--) well, that is subjective.''<ep>
   The Crowne Plaza development team is 100 percent black-owned, Peebles said. The Hyatt team is 78 percent black. <m1><ep>
<m0>   A financial analysis of the proposals by Tishman Hotel Corp., performed at the city's request, indicates that by at least a couple of measures, the Crowne Plaza is a better deal for the city than the Hyatt.<ep>

<m1><ep>
<m0>   The Crowne Plaza team proposes to pay $490,000 annually in base rent; the Hyatt team proposes to pay nothing the first year, $100,000 the third year and so on, sliding up year by year to $500,000 in the 26th year.<ep>

<m0>   But the panel's architectural review favored the Hyatt. Rocco Ceo, a professor at the University of Miami, and Vincent Scully, noted architectural historian, both praised the Hyatt design for its sensitivity to the surrounding neighborhood.<ep>
   The Hyatt hotel would rise behind the historic Shorecrest and Royal Palm hotels, in the 1500 block of Collins Avenue, and incorporate the old buildings into the design. It also preserves a pathway from Collins Avenue to the beach. Designed by Nichols Brosch Sandoval, the Hyatt is intended to look like a modern building with Deco flourishes.<ep>
   What distinguished the Hyatt, Ceo said, was ``the overall architectural fit of the Hyatt into the historic district.''<ep>
   Both Ceo and Scully ranked the Crowne Plaza the second of the seven proposals in terms of architecture. That design, by Arquitectonica, was conceived of as ``a village'' of modern buildings behind the historic hotels, also preserving both. This design would have terminated the view down Ocean Drive with a soaring tower of glass topped by palm trees, a contemporary icon of the tropics.<ep>
   ``Architecture played an important role in the deliberations,'' said Assistant City Manager Harry Mavrogenes, ``as it should.''<ql>
