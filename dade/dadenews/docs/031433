<m0>   Los Ranchos restaurateur Carlos Leonel Somoza has fulfilled a lifelong dream: to own a piece of Camelot.<ep>
   Somoza, nephew of assassinated Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza Debayle, was one of more than 500 bidders who left Sotheby's-New York with their arms full two weeks ago, after the much-publicized auction of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' personal possessions.<ep>
   ``I was incredibly lucky,'' Somoza, 43, said Thursday. ``I respect that woman so much. She was so private and now, all of a sudden, I own something that belonged to her, something that was so close to her.''<ep>
   That ``something'' is an elaborate table clock the former first lady bought in Paris in the early 1950s, when her husband, John, was Democratic senator from Massachusetts. Jacqueline Kennedy took it with her to the White House in 1960 and later to her Fifth Avenue apartment in New York City, where she died of cancer in May 1994.<ep>
   ``It's a unique piece,'' Somoza said. He paid $42,500 for the clock, which Sotheby's appraised at no more than $2,000. ``The best part is (--) it works fine.''<ep>
   The urn-shaped timepiece, silver and ``flamingo pink'' in color, is 4 1/2 inches tall and rests on a marble base. Reminiscent of a Faberge egg, it was made in Austria in the 1920s.<ep>
   Somoza, an avid art collector, also bought two berry spoons (--) specialty spoons with perforations that allow the juice to escape (--) for $8,200. Sotheby's original asking price: $80 for the pair.<ep>
   Somoza and his business partners are planning an exhibition of Kennedy memorabilia that will tour their five steak houses in Miami, from late May to July 15. The clock and spoons will be the featured items.<ql>
