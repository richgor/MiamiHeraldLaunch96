   Michael J. Peter rose to riches his own way, mixing pricey liquor, naked women and business savvy. For 20 years, his strip clubs have sprung up in South Florida and beyond, luring customers with upscale entertainment.<ep>
   For 20 years, the law has shadowed him. Always, he walked away unscathed and gained a ``reputation of invincibility,'' says a U.S. Department of Justice memo titled ``Operation Naked Dollars.''<ep>
   Maybe no more.<ep>
   In West Palm Beach federal court Friday, Peter sat in the defendant's chair as his attorney Roy Black and the U.S. attorney's office announced they had come to terms on a plea agreement.<ep>
   The deal, cut one month before Peter was to stand trial on a 10-count indictment, would have him plead guilty to one racketeering charge, serve a two-year prison term, pay a $25,000 fine and give up his liquor licenses and strip clubs. The government would drop the remaining charges.<ep>
   There's an unusual twist: Peter, 48, wouldn't have to surrender to federal authorities until January. Meanwhile, he'd be freed from house arrest, be allowed to drink liquor and be permitted to travel to conduct his business affairs.<ep>
   The reason: to allow Peter to sell off his assets, with the proceeds going to pay off a multimillion-dollar civil lawsuit. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``He will need some time,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence LaVecchio told the judge Friday. ``And he can't do that from jail.''<ep>
   Because Peter spent five months behind bars awaiting trial, he'd likely serve less than a year and a half once in prison. Once out, he'd serve two years on supervised release.<ep>
   It's not set in stone, however. U.S. District Judge Daniel T.K. Hurley, presented the proposed plea deal Friday, said he needs time before approving it. Hurley ordered a presentence investigation by the U.S. probation department.<ep>
   The judge admitted being taken aback by the sudden turn of events in a case so brutally fought it fills several feet of court files.<ep>
   Despite the steady shadow of law enforcement, Peter has risen to vast wealth (--) and respect within his business. At his clubs, employees are known to rush to open doors for him. He drove around town in a white Rolls-Royce. He owned a talent agency.<ep>
   Court papers say Peter claims to own or manage 50 adult-entertainment clubs grossing $100 million a year. Among them: Solid Gold and Pure Platinum in Fort Lauderdale, Thee Dollhouse in Pompano Beach, Solid Gold and La Bare in North Miami Beach (--) and clubs in Orlando, New York, Minneapolis, Providence, Myrtle Beach, Chicago and Honolulu.<ep>
   If the case went to trial, Peter would face federal charges that essentially accuse him of two types of crimes:<ep>
   (box) One, that he allowed a convicted felon and organized-crime figures to maintain hidden ownerships in his Broward strip clubs (--) and paid those figures $500 a week cash under the table.<ep>
   (box) Two, that he repeatedly strong-armed competitors and colleagues. The indictment recounts five alleged instances of extortion (--) with Peter threatening to have the fingers crushed of one man recruiting his dancers and threatening to expose ``secrets'' of another man he purportedly owes millions of dollars.<ep>
   Along the way, Black's law office attacked the government's case at its core, calling references to mob figures ``highly prejudicial,'' and alleging the government initially searched Peter's businesses in Dade and Broward based on an affidavit filled with lies and half-truths.<ep>
   And Black (--) one of Florida's best known criminal defense lawyers recognized for his low-key courtroom charm (--) has some high-powered ammunition of his own.<ep>
   Two of the government's initial informants (--) one even planted by agents as a Peter employee (--) are now Peter turncoats who say they are willing to testify. For the defense.<ep>
   ``It was anything to get MJP,'' said Warren Stang, 41, who was a paid informant and a government plant in the Peter organization as far back as 1991. ``They had nothing, and they were willing to pay me to come up with anything. The whole thing was bogus from the start.''<ep>
