   KEY WEST (--) All eyes turn to the little table in the middle when someone new arrives (--) raccoon eyes, rabbit, chicken, hawks, owls and prairie dog eyes.<ep>
   That's where volunteers of Wildlife Rescue of the Florida Keys take blood samples, wrap wings or give physical exams to the 1,000 injured animals that require their help every year.<ep>
   ``It would be nice not to be in the middle of 150 animals staring at the animal you're trying to calm down,'' said Becky Barron, the group's director. ``It's like if the doctor is trying to check you out in the emergency room and you're in the middle of the waiting room. It would be unnerv<m4>Becky  Barron<m2><ql>
<m0>ing.''<ep>
   For the past year and a half, Wildlife Rescue has run its little animal hospital from a chicken-wire building at McCoy Indigenous Park in Key West. It's much better quarters than those the group had before at the Key West bight.<ep>
   But volunteers believe they could do a lot more for their patients with a few improvements. They hope a Wildlife Wingding party next weekend will help them raise the $15,000 they figure they need to build a treatment room, office and rehabilitation cage.<ep>
   ``They're just going to be a little fancier shed,'' Barron said.<ep>
   Although the existing prefabricated building gives animals shade and rain protection, no parts of it are totally enclosed. The office now is a plastic storage closet a few steps away from the multipurpose table. Once a week, volunteers must drive the injured birds to a flight table in Tavernier for the exercise they need to be eventually released into the wild.<ep>
   ``It doesn't make any sense,'' Barron said.<ep>
   The group, which operates on private donations only, has already raised $3,000 for construction.<ep>
   An auction, music and other activities are planned for the fund-raiser at Indigenous Park at the corner of White Street and Atlantic Boulevard.<ep>
   All for the birds.<ep>
   ``They'll come whether we build it or not,'' Barron said.<ep>
