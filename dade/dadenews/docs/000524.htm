   A University of Miami dean who handles student discipline cases is being investigated by police for allegedly sexually assaulting a former student, school officials said.<P>

   Jerry E. Houston, 43, the associate dean of students at UM, was suspended without pay until the Coral Gables police department concludes its investigation, said UM spokeswoman Conchita Ruiz-Topinka. <P>

   According to police, a 22-year-old woman went to the Gables police station the evening of April 25, saying that at 3 p.m. that day, Houston sexually assaulted her in a car in the back parking lot of the Riviera movie theater, 1560 S. Dixie Highway.<P>

    ``It's an ongoing investigation,'' said Coral Gables Sgt. Mitchell Fry, declining further comment.<P>

   Ruiz-Topinka said Houston's accuser is a senior who had taken the semester off. <P>

   University officials said they were not notified of her complaint until Friday, May 3. Administrators met Monday and decided to suspend the longtime administrator. <P>

   ``The university takes these allegations very seriously,'' Ruiz-Topinka said. ``It does not condone behavior which can be construed as an abuse of authority. At this point, it's in [the police's ] hands.''<P>

   Houston, who has not been charged, did not return telephone messages.<P>

   He is one of two deans who assist the dean of students with student discipline issues. He joined the university in 1979 as an assistant to the dean and was promoted to associate dean in 1989. Houston graduated from the university in 1975 with a bachelors degree in education.<P>

   Records show Houston had trouble with the law once before: A jury acquitted him of a 1992 incident in which he was accused of hitting his neighbor in the head with a shovel.
