<m0>   The Dade County Expressway Authority seems to be spinning its wheels.<ep>
   Created two years ago, the authority was by now supposed to be running six of Dade's principal toll roads: the Dolphin, Airport and Shula expressways, Gratigny Parkway, and Venetian and Rickenbacker causeways.<ep>
   But the authority, which meets monthly at the Metro-Dade Commission chambers, has yet to take over the roads. The expressways remain firmly in the control of the Florida Department of Transportation and the causeways in county hands.<ep>
   DOT bond attorneys say the agency cannot relinquish control of the expressways because agreements with bondholders mandate that only the DOT run them. Lawyers say the authority will have to wait until the bonds are paid off in 2004.<ep>
   Dade has not objected to yielding the causeways, but authority Chairman Sonny Holtzman said Tuesday he wants the expressways first.<ep>
   ``They're the priority,'' Holtzman said. ``We want to wait on the causeways until the expressway issue is resolved.''<ep>
   The development is a blow to authority plans to use toll revenues for projects aimed at reducing traffic congestion, particularly on the Dolphin Expressway.<ep>
   The Dolphin, State Road 836, is the only east-west expressway serving West Dade's bedroom communities.<ep>
   Holtzman and authority Executive Director Servando M. Parapar have made it a priority to improve traffic flow in Dade, the nation's fourth most congested urban area.<ep>
   Another, perhaps more immediate, problem is whether the authority will have money to repay a $450,000 loan it got from the county last year to hire staff.<ep>
   The authority requested the loan believing that by now it would be running the roads and managing the tolls.<ep>
   Although the loan must be repaid by Sept. 30, authority aides believe the county will extend it.<ep>
   Even so, the delay is frustrating to authority leaders, who want to prove that they can do something about congestion.<ep>
   Reflecting the strain caused by the delay, Holtzman, Parapar and other members wondered publicly last week whether the authority will have to wait almost a decade to achieve its goal.<ep>
   ``Why were we created in the first place?'' Holtzman asked in explaining his frustration after reading the DOT's letter outlining the reason for the delay.<ep>
   Though the letter was received in November, Holtzman first disclosed its existence at last week's meeting.<ep>
   Discussion began when George Berlin, the authority's budget and finance committee chief, suggested that more time be devoted to acquiring the expressways.<ep>
   ``I suggest we concentrate on resolving this issue,'' Berlin said. ``I'm fearful that we won't be able to recover lost time. I suggest we make it the highest priority.''<ep>
   Holtzman agreed, and Parapar promised to move the issue along.<ep>
   If the authority doesn't get moving, Parapar said, ``I don't have a job.''<ep>
   Parapar recently quit a senior planning job at the DOT to become the authority's first executive director.<ep>
   Although the authority is stuck, it's not giving up.<ep>
   Holtzman said he recently approached the DOT and bondholders with a proposal under which the authority would gain control of the expressways and then lease them to the DOT until the bonds are paid off.<ep>
   Though Holtzman hasn't received a response, he said Tuesday that he didn't hold out much hope for the plan.<ep>
   Even now, he said, a new plan is being drawn under which the authority would issue new bonds to pay off about $93 million in existing bonds.<ep>
   That's the plan proposed to the authority by its newly chosen financial adviser, Rauscher Pierce Refsnes of Miami.<ep>
   Whether the plan will work is unclear.<ep>
   At issue, said Holtzman, is whether the Internal Revenue Service can block the bond issue if it deems the authority not to be independent from state or county control.<ep>
   Holtzman said he's confident the authority can demonstrate its independence.<ep>
   Although members are appointed by the governor and the county commission, they do not take instructions from either.<ep>
   ``We report to no one,'' Holtzman said.<ql>
