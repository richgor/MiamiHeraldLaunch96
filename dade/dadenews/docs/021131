    A consulting firm studying the fates of three soon-to-be-vacated public housing developments has suggested the county tear one down, convert another into rental housing and turn the last into privately owned townhomes.<ep>
   After Metropolitan Dade Housing and Urban Development announced plans earlier this year to close Townpark Gardens in Overtown, Larchmont Gardens in Little River and Musa Isle apartments in Allapattah because of extensive repairs needed at each site, Arthur Andersen was hired to determine the best use for the properties.<ep>
   The final assessment hasn't been completed, but a preliminary presentation to HUD officials suggests the properties' best use (--) from a financial standpoint (--) would be to convert Townpark into privately owned townhomes, Larchmont Gardens into market-rate rental apartments and to demolish Musa Isles and replace it with 75 townhomes for private ownership.<ep>
   The final report will be issued in the next few weeks and the county commission will have the final say on each development. ``At least now we have a sense of what's feasible for these three properties,'' said Greg Byrne, Metro HUD director.<ep>
   Flat housing sales in Little River make it a risky venture to convert Larchmont into condominiums, Byrne said. Andersen's studies suggest it would take five years to sell the 325 units. But strong demand for apartments makes Larchmont a strong candidate for conversion to rental property.<ep>
   At a HUD advisory board meeting this week, Byrne said two-bedroom units at Larchmont would be ``easy to fill'' at $550 a month. He said Andersen found private developers would be likely to pay between $7,000 to $8,000 a unit because of the estimated $20,000- to $30,000-a-unit cost to repair the apartments.<ep>
   Consultants say developers wouldn't pay the $6 million needed to rehabilitate Musa Isles because the units are too small and the market rents wouldn't pay for the repairs. Andersen estimates a private developer could purchase the property, tear down the buildings and build 75 townhomes on the property that could sell for about $75,000 apiece.<ep>
   At Townpark in Overtown, where $3.5 million in repairs are needed, Andersen suggests the units could sell for about $48,000 as affordable townhomes. Byrne said because of its proximity to downtown and Jackson Memorial Hospital, area employees earning $16,000 to $30,000 would be the target buyers.<ep>
   Byrne said several area politicians and community leaders have expressed strong support for making Townpark available for home ownership. The 1990 Census found only 4.7 percent of Overtown housing owner-occupied.<ep>
   ``I've been amazed at the support. A number of people are so tickled with the notion of doing that to initiate neighborhood renewal.''<ep>
    More than 800 residents of the three developments are being moved into Section 8 housing and other public housing developments.<ql>
