<m0>  Becky Toonkel debates many things, but helping others isn't one of them.<ep>
   The president of the Charger Debate Society, she tutors elementary school students and even created an instructional coloring book that focuses on health and hygiene. She hopes to convince the School Board to use it in Dade public schools next year.<ep>
   Toonkel has excelled in state and national levels of Lincoln-Douglas debate. The National Forensics League awarded her its Degree of Superior Distinction.<ep>
   This year, she was one of three Dade County students named semifinalists in the prestigious Westinghouse Science Talent Search. For her project, she conducted a computer analysis of the correlation between a person's biographical background and success in college.<ep>
