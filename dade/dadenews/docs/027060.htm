   Spinning tales, the stranger charmed his way into a nonprofit agency in Little Havana, where he would smother the viejitas  -- the little old ladies -- in hugs and kisses.<P>

   The same mysterious man, Eduardo Gutierrez, now stands accused of bilking scores of poor, elderly Hispanics out of thousands of dollars in a crude citizenship scam.<P>

   People who knew Gutierrez said he won everyone's sympathy -- and their help -- by saying he was ill with AIDS and wished to do something worthwhile in his remaining days.<P>

   But it turns out they knew little about the man they put to work helping the elderly.<P>

   Now that Gutierrez has disappeared, they doubt everything he ever told them.<P>

   ``He was nice to everyone. He was pleasant,'' said Carmen Christina Naylor, acting director at the agency, Los Viejos Utiles, or The Useful Aged, that took in Gutierrez. ``Who knew he was going to take the money and run?''<P>

   More than 150 people say they each paid Gutierrez $120 for help in applying for U.S. citizenship but got nothing in return. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who exposed the alleged con, said many more may have been defrauded but may not realize it because the government takes as long as 18 months to process naturalization applications. Gutierrez's alleged take: about $18,000.<P>

   According to Ros-Lehtinen, Gutierrez would alter money orders made out to ``I.N.S.'' -- the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- to read ``E.M. Gutierrez,'' then cash them.<P>

   For many of his alleged victims, who survive on small government checks, the fraud represented the loss of money painstakingly scraped together.<P>

   ``You sacrifice to fill out those applications,'' said Juan Rodriguez, 76, who paid Gutierrez $250 for applications for himself and his wife out of his monthly $350 disability check.<P>

   ``Imagine,'' said his wife, Eulogia Rodriguez, 78. ``We are bitter.''<P>

   How such a swindle could have gone unnoticed for at least several months is unclear. Carmen Maine, executive director of Los Viejos Utiles during the time Gutierrez worked there as a volunteer, has died. People familiar with the agency say she was ill and unable to properly supervise his work.<P>

   But two former volunteers at Viejos say they stopped working with Gutierrez because they smelled something fishy.<P>

   ``It never crossed my mind that he was doing something like this,'' said Sylvia Pulido, who helped Gutierrez set up his private business filling out citizenship applications after he left Los Viejos Utiles in an apparent dispute with Maine.<P>

   ``What I didn't like is that many people would call to check on their case,'' said Pulido, a former state legislative aide who now does volunteer work at a Little Havana church, ``and though he wouldn't say outright he was an immigration official, he would imply he was connected.<P>

   ``He would tell so many lies. Another time, he said he was going to Guantanamo to process Cubans. When I asked him about it, he said he had offered to go.<P>

   ``To me, he was not well in the head.''<BR>
Began two years ago<P>

   The strange tale begins some two years ago with Ramon Alonso, an aide at Metro-Dade Commissioner Bruce Kaplan's district office in Little Havana.<P>

   Alonso said he met Gutierrez at the Miami Beach home of family friends, where he was apparently sleeping on the floor. Gutierrez said he was sick.<P>

   ``He was introduced to me as a person with AIDS, and he said he was trying to do something useful with the rest of the time he had left,'' Alonso said.<P>

   Impressed, Alonso said he introduced Gutierrez to people who did community work around Little Havana. Alonso also let him stay in a room at his home, with the understanding that he would begin to pay rent as soon as he got on his feet. Alonso says he did not question Gutierrez about his background.<P>

   ``I remember people taking him out to supper, feeling sorry for this man,'' Alonso said. ``We pitied him. We thought he was really sick.''<BR>
Citizenship help<P>

   At the time, Carlos and Madeline Rogers, a couple who ran a licensed fingerprinting business and did community work, were making arrangements to fill out citizenship applications for clients at Los Viejos Utiles. They were supposed to charge $10, which mostly covered the cost of film for the required pictures, but wound up doing many for free, Madeline Rogers said.<P>

   Alonso persuaded the couple to train Gutierrez as a volunteer helper.<P>

   ``Eddie told me he was gay and had AIDS. He gave me this whole story,'' Madeline Rogers said. ``He was so convincing. He even said he wanted to go to Cuba to see his mother before he died.<P>

   ``He came off as very charming, very generous. When I tried to give him a little money, he said no.''<P>

   But the arrangement didn't last long. Rogers discovered that Gutierrez was making appointments to see clients behind her back and charging them, cutting into her meager income from filling out the applications. Irked, she and her husband left the agency, taking their Polaroid camera.<P>

   Maine, the director, then bought Gutierrez a new camera and let him take over the service, Rogers said.<BR>
Stampede to apply<P>

   When the new Republican leadership in Congress began floating proposals to cut off public assistance to legal immigrants, demand for citizenship boomed. Gutierrez placed public-service ads on Spanish-language radio and had fliers advertising the service distributed on the street.<P>

   Pulido, who then came in as Gutierrez's volunteer helper, said there were sometimes 60 people in the office waiting for help. She said Gutierrez once told her he had filled out applications for 3,000 or 4,000 people.<P>

   But soon things went awry again. Alonso, the Kaplan aide, had a falling-out with Gutierrez over the fliers. On the bottom, the sheets claimed the service was co-sponsored by the commissioner. Kaplan had nothing to do with it, Alonso and other aides say.<P>

   After a couple of months, Alonso also kicked Gutierrez out of his home when he refused to begin paying rent.<P>

   ``He used to say he was working at Viejos Utiles. He was claiming he was making money,'' Alonso said. ``But he didn't pay for the room. I asked him to leave, and he did quietly.''<BR>
Another resigns<P>

   Pulido also quit, saying she was fed up with Gutierrez's fibs, though she says she never realized the truth until she saw news reports about the alleged scam.<P>

   ``He's the kind of person who wins you over with his lip, with talk,'' she said. ``If he sees you, even if he doesn't like you at all, he'll be all smiles and ask you how you and the kids are.<P>

   ``He had a lot of charisma. I know many people who still say he was not capable of doing those things.''<P>

   For some of his clients, Gutierrez might have done the right thing. Several relatives of those who claim they were defrauded said they became citizens after their applications were filed with the INS.<P>

   Some forms, though, were sent after Gutierrez left Los Viejos Utiles to open his business, Pulido said. Volunteers found a stack of filled-out applications that they sent to INS.<P>

   By the time Gutierrez opened the business, though, demand had slacked off, Pulido said. Community groups were offering the service free of charge. He closed shop around June of last year, left his Coral Gables apartment, and no one has seen him since.<BR>
An invisible man<P>

   There have been alleged sightings of Gutierrez around town, rumors of calls from Chicago. At Ros-Lehtinen's request, the FBI has been asking questions.<P>

   But Gutierrez remains a cipher. A citizenship application he completed, but never mailed, lists no jobs in the previous five years, no memberships or organizations, little in fact but a five-day vacation to Mexico in 1989.<P>

   Some people said they recall his saying he came on the Mariel boatlift, which could be true. His Social Security number was issued in 1980.<P>

   The form lists his height as 6-foot-2. According to his driver's license, he's 5-foot-10.<P>

   ``He conned everybody,'' Madeline Rogers said.
