    Late Saturday, rescue crews were trying to determine whether the ValuJet aircraft disintegrated on impact or partially lodged itself in the soft, marshy terrain of the Everglades.<ep>
   The area where Flight 592 crashed Saturday is thick with razor-tooth sawgrass and a variety of wildlife, including alligators. Popular with airboaters, froggers and fishermen, the swampy muck beneath the water may have acted as a pincushion, essentially swallowing the disabled DC-9 aircraft.<ep>
   ``That's why you don't see big parts of it,'' theorized Harold Johnson, vice president of the Everglades Coordinating Council and an airboater familiar with the area. ``It may have just swallowed it up. It's like quicksand. It doesn't have a bottom.''<ep>
   Maj. Jim Ries of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission said that's a likely scenario, depending on the trajectory of the aircraft on impact.<ep>
   ``It looks like a large part of the airplane must be below the muck and mud. That stuff can be very deep before you hit shell rock,'' or limestone, Ries said.<ep>
   May is generally the dry season in the Everglades, with water only one to three feet deep. During the rainy season, it can reach <m1> <m0>five feet in places.<ep>
   Alligators in the area can grow to 12 feet or more in length. But Steve Coughlin, a biologist with the <m1> <m0>game and fish commission, said they probably pose no threat to searchers.<ep>
   ``Usually something like that scares wildlife away,'' he said. ``And if there's fuel or oil or anything like that in the water, alligators won't get anywhere near there.''<ep>
   Coughlin said the crash isn't likely to pose a hazard to wildlife or water quality in the area. But salvaging what's left of the aircraft may be difficult since it's nearly impossible to get heavy equipment into the area.<ql>
