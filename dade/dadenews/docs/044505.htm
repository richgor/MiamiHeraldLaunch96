   Two Metro mayoral hopefuls want to make it cheaper to fill up your car's gas tank, even if some of the roads you drive may be bumpier as a result.<P>

  Jumping on a cross-country bandwagon to cut federal, state and local taxes on gasoline, Metro Commissioners Maurice Ferre and Alex Penelas on Thursday issued separate proposals for rolling back some of a six-cent-a-gallon county tax on motor fuel.<P>

   Penelas, who has formally entered the Metro mayor's race, wants to cut at least three cents off the tax and says he's open to cutting even more. Ferre wants to shave two cents off and says anything more would devastate transportation projects funded by the tax. <P>

   ``Two cents hurts, but it does not cripple us,'' said Ferre, who says he intends to declare his candidacy for the September election soon. He had been a strong supporter of the tax since it was enacted in September 1993 and has resisted previous attempts to roll it back.<P>

   Commissioner Javier Souto got the ball rolling Tuesday when he asked County Manager Armando Vidal to draft a proposal to repeal the six-cent tax. <P>

    To cut the tax, the commission must hold public hearings and pass an ordinance. If approved, a rollback would take two to three more months to take effect at the pump, Metro budget director Stephen Spratt said. <P>

   Each cent of the tax accounts for about $7.5 million in revenue a year, and $37.5 million of the $45 million generated is earmarked for capital transportation projects. That means plans to resurface streets and build sidewalks would be delayed, Vidal said.<P>

   The remaining $7.5 million, which helps fund the operation of Metro-Dade's public transit system, is all but untouchable, which would leave the commission with the task of determining which projects to proceed with and which to shelve. <P>

   ``We've got to decide how much we want to repeal and how we're going to reprioritize projects,'' Penelas said.<P>

    Vidal would prefer to do nothing. ``My position in the budget is the gas tax should be left as is,'' he said.<P>

   But if commissioners insisted on a tax cut, the county could handle a one-cent reduction, Vidal said. But what worries him more is that in the heat of the county mayor race the entire tax could be scrapped to score political points. ``That will present major problems,'' Vidal said.<P>

   Since late March, the average price of self-service unleaded fuel in Miami has climbed 11 cents, to $1.311 a gallon -- about a third of which goes to various taxes.<P>

   The steep increase has politicians from President Clinton on down trying to gain political mileage by cutting taxes on gasoline. The effort to temporarily roll back the 4.3-cent-a gallon federal tax had been stalled, but on Friday it got a boost when the proposed measure cleared a key House committee.<P>

   Whether a reduction in the county tax would result in lower prices at the pump is not certain. Gas prices are influenced by a variety of factors; taxes are but one.<P>

   ``It may or may not show up at the pump,'' said George Petrie, regional operations manager for the Automobile Association of America, which tracks gas prices.<P>

  Another concern, raised by some members of Congress on Thursday, is that fuel distributors might not pass along the savings to drivers and would instead pocket the extra money.<P>

   Historically, however, tax rollbacks have been passed along, Petrie said. But if the rollback is only a cent, customers aren't likely to realize they're saving any money, Petrie said.<P>

   ``Any relief will be welcome, but to be honest, one cent at the pump is difficult to discern because there's always a one- or two-cent fluctuation from station to station,'' Petrie said.<BR>
