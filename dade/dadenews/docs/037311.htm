<H2>Judge: FPL radiation levels `harmless'</H2>

   Dade educator Leonard Glazer has been fighting leukemia for nearly a decade. His wife, Elsa, died of it.<P>

   On Monday, a state court judge refused to let a jury hear his theory of how the couple got sick: That Florida Power & Light exposed them to electromagnetic fields, and for 20 years, did nothing to warn them.<P>

   Circuit Judge W. Thomas Spencer ruled that the amount of radiation from transmission lines behind the Glazers' home in Coral Gables was insufficient to be harmful.<P>

   After hearing several hours of arguments, the judge issued this one-line ruling: ``FPL has no duty to warn of a harmless level of radiation.''<P>

   His decision came a few days after he decided FPL could not be held responsible for higher radiation levels that came from water pipes behind the Glazer home. For years, the Glazers' bed was a scant eight feet from the pipes, which served as a grounding device for the home. <P>

   ``I feel bad for them,'' said Miami attorney Alvin Davis, who led the company's courtroom defense. ``But the level of magnetic fields from our facility didn't cause any harm.''<P>

   He said the outcome ought to give pause to plaintiffs' lawyers who have made power line cases a national ``issue du jour.''<P>

   But Fort Lauderdale attorney Howard Talenfeld, who submitted a 40-page memo to the court alleging two decades of cover-ups, obfuscation and heavy-handed influence over regulators by FPL, said he would take his client's case to the Third District Court of Appeal.<P>

   Glazer, 59, now performs administrative work for the school district because of his illness. Since remarried, he has two grown children.<P>

   A former principal at Palmetto Junior High School and North Miami Senior High, Glazer alleged in his 1994 lawsuit that the company's distribution line above and behind his house caused the leukemia. His attorneys later amended the suit to claim the company was also liable for the electricity in the water pipes, which are maintained by the county.<P>

   The case quickly became among the most closely watched in the power industry and among consumer groups. Out of more than three dozen lawsuits nationally, it was the first to allege that leukemia was caused by transmission lines. It was also the first to assert that a public utility was responsible for sources of electromagnetic fields that it did not oversee.<P>

   Davis called the latter theory a ``novel'' one with a potentially far-reaching impact on the industry. But Spencer ended the suspense by throwing out that portion of the case late last month. He said the company could not have known of the radiation in the pipes some 20 years ago.<P>

   Glazer said his most pressing goal now is to inform the public about the potential health hazards from electric power facilities.<P>

   ``I'm not going to win,'' he said. ``I'm going to die.''<P>

   His advice to fellow homeowners:<P>

   ``Find out if you're in a field,'' he said. ``Get a gauge and measure your home.''<P>

   His attorney, Talenfeld, argued that the company had effectively left its customers devoid of information about potential transmission line dangers.<P>

   He compiled a chronology of events to show the judge that FPL had assiduously avoided warning the public about the dangers of electromagnetic fields. He compared the company's position with that now being fought by tobacco companies under siege nationally for allegedly hiding the ill effects of smoking from their customers.<P>

   But in court Monday, Davis countered that Talenfeld had gone overboard. He said FPL is not a research organization nor a regulatory agency. Yes, he said, the company is obliged to follow the rules promulgated by the state Public Service Commission. Radiation from its transmission lines has never been shown to cause leukemia, he said. <P>

   ``FPL is not a public health agency,'' he said. ``FPL is not responsible for other sources of magnetic fields - of which there are many.''<P>

   Glazer said he intends to keep fighting to prove the opposite.<P>

   ``I wish it hadn't happened today,'' he said of the ruling. ``But it'll give me incentive to stay around.''
