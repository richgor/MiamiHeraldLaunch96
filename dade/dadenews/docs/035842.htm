  Katia Prince might just be the model immigrant.<P>

  Seven years after arriving from Haiti, she has shown unusual grit, graduating near the top of her high school class despite enduring foster care and the death of her father. A poised aspiring lawyer, she now works part time and attends college full time.<P>

   If bills passed by the U.S. Congress become law, though, her success could earn her just one thing: deportation.<P>

   A measure in bills approved by both the House and Senate would subject many legal immigrants who are not yet citizens, but use public aid, to expulsion from the country.<P>

   Critics say the deportation threat is only the most extreme of a series of measures in the bills that essentially cut off public aid to most legal immigrants. A conference committee is scheduled to iron out mostly minor differences in the bills before sending a compromise to President Clinton.<P>

   On Wednesday, the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center gathered several immigrants to tell how they would be hurt, stories that the advocates said would be repeated thousands of times in Miami if the measures become law.<P>

   Prince's dilemma: As a sophomore at Florida International University, she has taken advantage of federal student loans for nearly two years.<P>

   Under the congressional bills, legal permanent U.S. residents who use such income-dependent aid for more than 12 months in their first five to seven years in the country would be placed in deportation proceedings once they apply to become citizens.<P>

   That means Prince would have to give up on her dream of becoming a citizen.<P>

   ``How can that be fair?'' said Prince, 19. ``I'm planning on being a lawyer and maybe getting into politics. I would like to have a say-so in what laws are passed. But right now, I can't even vote.''<P>

   For Nicaraguan immigrant Lucille Frederick, 85, another recently passed law could have even more devastating consequences.<P>

   Most of her family fled political turmoil in Nicaragua 12 years ago and entered the country illegally. They became legalized under a law that grants U.S. residency to those who have been here longer than seven years, have established roots, and can convince a judge they would suffer extreme hardship if deported.<P>

   Frederick's case is pending.<P>

   But the anti-terrorism bill signed by Clinton has a measure barring people like Frederick from obtaining residency.<P>

   Though the Senate last week passed an amendment to its immigration bill that would rescind that provision, the House immigration bill doesn't have a similar amendment.<P>

   For Frederick, the anti-terrorism bill, if unaltered, could mean deportation.<P>

   The Rev. Thomas Wenski, director of Catholic Charities in Miami, labeled such provisions as ``anti-family.'' He said they're aimed at the wrong people -- legal immigrants who have played by the rules.<P>

   Under the bills, most legal immigrants would no longer qualify for welfare programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, disability payments and Medicaid, as well as most income-dependent aid, ranging from disaster relief and low-income housing to Head Start.
