   The fate of South Florida's creakiest psychiatric hospital remains murky since state legislators couldn't come up with plans to downsize and privatize the 355-bed Pembroke Pines facility.<ep>
   The Legislature gave its blessing for a smaller, possibly privately run hospital, but it will be up to the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to figure out what to do about South Florida State Hospital.<ep>
   In the state budget passed early Saturday, the Legislature said HRS may begin to replace facilities at South Florida State Hospital with a private psychiatric facility with conditions: Patient welfare and public safety cannot suffer; released patients must have access to suitable community mental health programs; hospital clients must be kept near family whenever possible; and hospital employees should be given opportunities for other state employment.<ep>
   ``We now have some sense as to where we stand,'' SFSH hospital administrator Thomas Gramley said. ``We now know what will be expected of us. I think the Legislature has outlined very nicely the concerns for the well-being of the residents and the staff.''<ep>
   South Florida State Hospital, which opened on Feb. 27, 1957, to treat South Florida residents with chronic psychiatric problems, has fallen into disrepair. After its patients sued in federal court alleging inhumane conditions and inadequate treatment at the hospital, HRS agreed to make sweeping improvements.<ep>
    The hospital, which serves Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe counties, is already filled to capacity. HRS studies show the area needs 511 psychiatric beds to meet community needs.<ep>
   Legislators latched on to the notion of downsizing and private management during the 1995 legislative session after Specialty Corp., a Miami firm that wants to build the new hospital, suggested a privately built and run hospital would save money. <m1><ep>
<m0>   On orders from the Legislature, HRS and mental health advocacy committees met for eight months to devise a privatization and downsizing plan for the hospital. The plan did not address whether privatization would work.<ep>
