<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Beach club closed in raid to reopen</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->
   Glam Slam, the popular South Beach club shut down early this year after a drug raid, is set to reopen soon under new management.<P>

     Yves Di Lena, proprietor for 3 1/2 years of another Beach club, Warsaw, said Tuesday that he will take charge of running Glam Slam, which is owned by The Artist Formerly Known As Prince. He did not give a target date for reopening, saying only that he is ``working to solve the problems of the past.''<P>

   Agents from the state's Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco agency, working with Miami Beach police, shut down Glam Slam in an early morning raid Jan. 6 that resulted in suspension of the club's liquor license.<P>

   Since then, hearings on reinstating the license have been scheduled, postponed and rescheduled. Jorge Herrera, ABT's district supervisor, said Tuesday he still was looking ``at what [the new operators] have to say about more lighting, more closed-circuit cameras'' to help prevent drug use in the club.<P>

   John Brandt of the Brandt Organization, a Connecticut group that owns the building housing the club, 1235 Washington Ave., said rent would still be paid by the Prince company Paisley Park.

<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Martinez jury begins deliberations</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->

    Jurors began deliberating Wednesday in the third federal corruption trial of Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez -- pausing only once to ask U.S. District Judge James Kehoe about the testimony of key prosecution witness Silvio Cardoso.<P>

   Their question: whether Cardoso feared he would suffer ``economic loss'' if he refused to sell Martinez 10 Hialeah lots at cost.<P>

   Cardoso, a Hialeah councilman and developer at the time, testified that he ultimately sold Martinez the lots at cost, and the mayor profited by $70,000.<P>

   Prosecutors say Martinez used his position as mayor to extort Cardoso and other developers. Martinez says the transactions were legal; he merely negotiated good business deals.<P>

   Martinez was convicted at his first trial in 1991 on six of eight counts of extortion and racketeering. But appellate judges ordered a new trial in 1994, citing flawed jury instructions and flagrant jury misconduct. That trial ended March 26 in a hung jury. The third trial began April 22.<P>

   Kehoe recessed the trial until 9 a.m. today while he decides whether to read back Cardoso's testimony or send transcripts to the jury room.

<H2>Child-support amnesty plan extended</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
    Parents who are behind on their child-support payments have until Monday to set up an appointment with the state attorney's office to work out a payment plan under an amnesty window.<P>

   An amnesty period was extended to the new Monday deadline to give more time for out-of-town parents to apply. These appointments, or conferences, will be set up June 3, 4 and 5.<P>

   Parents who are behind on payments and do not set up appointments or payment plans could be arrested for contempt of court and subjected to prosecution.<P>

   To set up an appointment or to ask questions, call (305) 536-3495 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays.

<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Discovery cruise ship catches fire</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->
   About 800 passengers were evacuated from a Discovery cruise ship Wednesday after a fire broke out in the engine room just offshore from Freeport, Bahamas. <P>

   Thick black smoke could be seen from Freeport as tugboats with the Bahamas Oil Refinery Co. went out to assist Discovery I, which had sailed from Port Everglades. Three tugboats towed the ship back to Freeport about 3 p.m., The Nassau Tribune reported.<P>

   The passengers were evacuated safely, and no injuries were reported, said U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Jeff Hall.<P>

<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Suspect in Brazilian bank fraud caught</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->

   A Brazilian fugitive, wanted in connection with the theft of $200 million from the Banco do Brasil, was arrested Tuesday by the FBI.<P>

   Domingos Rosolia Neto, 38, was arrested in the parking lot of an apartment complex at 11169 North Kendall Dr. According to the investigation, Neto lives at 9339 SW 137th Ave., Apartment 703.<P>

   Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge William C. Turnoff ordered Neto held without bond.<P>

   The FBI believe Neto is one of six people involved in a conspiracy to defraud Banco do Brasil. With the help of co-conspirators, Neto allegedly was given loans for the improvement of a business that existed on paper only. The five other conspirators were arrested in Brazil.
