   Ricardo Delgado is a graphics designer in South Beach. He's also one of Dade's parking ticket scofflaws.<ep>
   The county's Parking Violations Bureau says Delgado is one of 358 vehicle owners with 20 or more unpaid parking tickets. Delgado doesn't deny it, but he blames his predicament on the perennial parking problem in South Beach.<ep>
   Though Delgado is not the worst offender (--) the champion holds 85 unpaid tickets (--) his story reflects a broader problem.<ep>
   Roughly 38 percent of the county's most notorious parking ticket scofflaws live in South Beach, one of the nation's hottest entertainment districts, where residents and visitors battle nightly for limited parking space.<ep>
   Many of the South Beach scofflaws say they are struggling young people who did not view parking tickets as a priority (--) until now.<ep>
<m1>A temporary amnesty<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   On Wednesday, the county declared a six-week parking ticket amnesty, giving drivers a price break before a major crackdown. Starting June 17, people with at least five overdue tickets will find their vehicles booted or towed.<ep>
   Harvey Ruvin, Clerk of Dade County Courts and parking violations bureau supervisor, said about 215,000 scofflaws hold more than $11 million in unpaid tickets.<ep>
   Delgado says he doesn't care if they try to seize his car. The 1981 Datsun with which he accumulated the unpaid tickets was wrecked and sold for scrap.<ep>
   ``That was a $300 car,'' Delgado said. ``So, I looked at the car, and then I looked at the tickets, and I decided to dump the car. Case closed.''<ep>
   Maybe.<ep>
   Ruvin said Dade plans to refer chronic unpaid ticket holders to collection agencies and credit bureaus.<ep>
   ``We know how to find these people,'' Ruvin said. ``The best thing for them to do now is to take advantage of the amnesty and get right.''<ep>
<m1>A record-breaking tally<m1><ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m1>   <m0>The man with the highest number of unpaid tickets, 85, seems to have left town and could not be reached at his forwarding addresses. The runner-up acknowledged getting 83 tickets. But Stephane Dupoux, a Miami Beach interior designer, said he paid them and has records to prove it.<ep>
   Ruvin said that if Dupoux can document his payments, he will be taken off the list.<ep>
   Most people on the list have, on average, 20-30 tickets. Some are planning to follow Ruvin's advice and take advantage of the amnesty.<ep>
   Alexis Rodriguez, who racked up 24 tickets while delivering food in South Beach, said he will pay at the reduced rate.<ep>
   Before the amnesty, Rodriguez's bill would have been $1,080, at $45 a ticket (--) the usual fee, including a late charge. But with the amnesty price break, Rodriguez will pay $576 or $24 per ticket.<ep>
   Other overdue parking ticket holders also plan to come clean, but reluctantly.<ep>
   ``We're going to go ahead and pay, but we're protesting these parking tickets,'' said Joe Risiola, vice president of Ocean Vending, which owes 36 parking tickets on its snack and soda delivery vehicle.<ep>
<m1>Bikes may be one answer<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   ``We think it's out-and-out theft,'' he said.<ep>
   Risiola said it was especially ``sickening'' to get parking tickets in parking-poor South Beach.<ep>
   ``Often, we park briefly while the driver dashes in to make a delivery, and by the time he comes out, one or two tickets are already on the windshield,'' Risiola said. ``Instead of pickpocketing us, they should use the gas tax money and build free parking lots.''<ep>
   Risiola acknowledged he should have paid the tickets earlier.<ep>
   ``But when you're in business, you have many other things to worry about,'' he said.<ep>
   John Patronie, a South Beach freelance photographer who accumulated 23 tickets on a 1985 Volkswagen, was puzzled that his name was still on the list.<ep>
   ``They took my car a year ago because I did not pay the tickets,'' Patronie said. ``They told me they were going to auction my car to settle the debt.''<ep>
   He said he didn't pay the tickets because he didn't have the money. Patronie said he couldn't even drive his car.<ep>
   It lacked a catalytic converter and had failed an emissions test. Since Patronie did not have enough money to buy the converter, and since his car couldn't pass the emissions test without one, he couldn't renew the tag.<ep>
   For now, Patronie has given up on cars.<ep>
   ``I ride a bike everywhere,'' he said. ``I'm in better shape.''<ep>
   Ruvin said the car was auctioned to pay towing and storage costs. But Patronie is still liable for the outstanding tickets.<ql>
