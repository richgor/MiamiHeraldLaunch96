   Alfredo Navarro Jr. doesn't know that being Hispanic makes him less likely to graduate from high school than many of his peers. What he does know is that he wants to go to college.<ep>
   ``Sometimes people just want to give up and drop out,'' said Navarro, 18, a Miami High School senior. ``I used to think like that, but not anymore.''<ep>
   Navarro is one of 49 Hispanic students from Miami and Jackson high schools who will attend Miami-Dade Community College on full scholarships this fall, as part of the college's Scholarship Tuition for At-Risk Students/Hispanic Opportunity Program for Education.<ep>
   The program, established in 1993, was one of several dropout-prevention programs recognized Friday by members of the Hispanic Dropout Project. Developed by the U.S. Department of Education in September 1995, the project tours the nation, surveying and documenting effective approaches designed to curb the growing Hispanic dropout rate nationwide.<ep>
   ``It's a national crisis with local solutions,'' said Walter Secada, director of the Hispanic Dropout Project and education professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ``We can learn a lot by looking at interventions that work.''<ep>
   The organization chose to visit Miami because of the large number of Hispanic students (--) 51 percent (--) in the school system.<ep>
   According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, 18 percent of Hispanic students nationwide who were tracked from 1988 to 1992, from eighth to 12th grade, dropped out. The figure represents the highest dropout rate among most ethnic groups, with 9 percent of white, non-Hispanic students and 15 percent of black, non-Hispanic students failing to finish school.<ep>
   ``However you count it,'' Secada said, ``Hispanics have a higher dropout rate than any other group, except for American Indians.''<ep>
   Dade County Hispanic dropout rates hover around the national average. In a similar study conducted by Dade County Public Schools, 17.58 percent of Hispanic students tracked from 1988 to 1992 dropped out of high school.<ep>
   Potential dropouts in Dade have grown sixfold since educators began keeping track of the figures during the mid-1980s.<ep>
   ``There's always room to do better,'' said Marilyn Neff, deputy schools superintendent for management and accountability. ``We can't control the economic pressure on students who feel they need to go out and work.''<ep>
   STARS/HOPE hopes to increase the number of graduating Hispanic students by selecting 50 Hispanic students, at risk of dropping out, from Miami and Jackson high schools each year to receive the scholarships. The students are selected at the end of their sophomore year and then are matched with mentors who help the students throughout high school and Miami-Dade.<ep>
   The program's success rate for the first group of students graduating from high school in June is near perfect. Only one student, who moved out of the county, dropped out of the program.<ep>
