    A former Metro division chief disciplined for a sexual escapade in the front seat of a police car will leave the department with a $180,000 settlement and a healthy retirement check.<ep>
  Jesus Bencomo got the money Tuesday from a reluctant Metro Commission. He'll agree to drop his lawsuits against the county and leave his job as a $93,908 police major with nothing to do.<ep>
  Bencomo will get a badge saying ``Division Chief, Retired'' and an annual pension of almost $50,000 per year.<ep>
  ``I don't like the recommendation any more than you do,'' County Manager Armando Vidal told commissioners. ``I think it's best for Dade County at this point in time to cut our losses and move forward.''<ep>
  Bencomo's lawyer has hinted that testimony would bring to light some unspecified embarrassing information about others in the department and County Hall. Metro Police Director Fred Taylor, who pushed for the settlement, said he wasn't worried.<ep>
  But Commissioner Bruce Kaplan, chairman of Metro's public safety committee, said it's better to pay the money and get rid of Bencomo.<ep>
  ``Going into a long, hot summer, we don't need all kinds of spurious allegations hanging over the heads of one of the finest police departments in the United States,'' he said.<ep>
  Bencomo, 50, was one of the highest-ranking officers in Metro when he landed in a 1994 sex scandal. A security guard said he saw a black Chevrolet rocking back and forth on the fifth floor of the Miami Children's Hospital parking garage. He reported a possible rape. An off-duty Metro detective looked through the window, saw a couple having sexual intercourse and recognized Bencomo.<ep>
  Bencomo denied that ever happened. He said he met a woman, chatted for a while in his car, then dropped her off a few minutes later. He never found out her name, he said.<ep>
  An internal investigation sustained charges of misconduct and Taylor busted Bencomo to the rank of major. Bencomo fought back with lawsuits, including a claim that he was the victim of anti-Hispanic discrimination.<ep>
  Taylor said he wanted to get rid of an expensive thorn in the department's side. He argued the county would pay more in the long run by keeping Bencomo on the payroll and fighting the lawsuits.<ep>
  The settlement was approved in a bizarre series of votes by Metro commissioners, clearly squirming with discomfort. Three potential mayoral candidates (--) Alex Penelas, Maurice Ferre and Arthur Teele Jr. (--) left the dais before the vote but returned afterward.<ep>
  First, commissioners shot down the deal on a voice vote. Then they took it up again on a roll-call vote. That time, the settlement went through.<ep>
  ``I heard about this particular employee. You feel kind of dirty just listening to it,'' said Commissioner Gwen Margolis, who supported the deal.<ep>
  Then, Commissioner Miguel Diaz de la Portilla changed his vote from yes to no, which would have killed the deal. Commissioner Natacha Millan then changed hers from no to yes, bringing it alive again. With the vote again 6 to 4, Ferre returned to cast a meaningless no vote.<ep>
  Voting for the deal were Kaplan, Margolis, Millan, James Burke, Pedro Reboredo and Javier Souto. Voting no were Diaz de la Portilla, Ferre, Betty Ferguson, Dennis Moss and Katy Sorenson.<ql>
