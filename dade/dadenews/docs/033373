<m0>   The Coconut Grove-based Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust has awarded medical research grants totaling $26 million to several universities, hospitals and technological institutes nationwide.<ep>
   Among the recipients is Florida State University, which will use a $500,000 grant for a structural biology program in its Institute of Molecular Biophysics.<ep>
   Grants of $2 million to be used to establish permanent endowments in Markey's name went to Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Rockefeller and Stanford universities; also the University of California-San Francisco, University of Michigan and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The income from the grants will be used to assist students pursuing careers in biomedical science.<ep>
     The University of Kentucky, Washington University and Yale University will use equal endowments to fund Lucille P. Markey professorships.<ep>
     Trustees selected the institutions from proposals on file, said Nancy Weber, director for program administration. The trust hasn't accepted new proposals in several years.<ep>
    ``There's been so much need that we've had to stick with people who have sent proposals over the past few years,'' Weber said.<ep>
   The trust was established in 1983 at the behest of Markey, former owner of thoroughbred horse racing's fabled Calumet Farm. When she died in Miami in July 1982, her will stipulated that the trust's assets be used to support medical research. She also requested that all funds be spent by 1997.<ep>
   Weber said the remaining grants will be significantly smaller and will be awarded to institutions known to the trust.<ql>
