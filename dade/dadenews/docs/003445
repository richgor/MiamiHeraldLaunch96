   Alleged Cuban agent Roberto Martin Cabrera went public Tuesday, but his statements left behind a wake of contradictions and doubts.<ep>
   One week after he told three leaders of the Cuban American National Foundation that they were marked for <m4>Martin<m2><ql>
<m0>assassination, Martin said he wasn't willing to kill them just to please the Cuban government.<ep>
   ``This is about human lives,'' said Martin, 26, at a news conference at the Hyatt Regency in Coral Gables, sponsored by the foundation. If he had carried out his assignment, he said, ``Florida might be in mourning today.''<ep>
   Cuba had laid out the plan and all the elements were in place, he said. All that was missing was the final go-ahead.<ep>
   ``We were going to blow up the foundation's headquarters at a time when the top leaders were inside,'' Martin said. ``I was waiting for the order to pick up the explosives and carry them to the building'' in a van.<ep>
   Martin said three or four other people were supposed to join him in the operation. But he also said he never met them or knew who they were. And he was never told what kind of explosives he would use and where he would pick them up.<ep>
   At the press conference and during a later interview, Martin provided few details of his actions at the behest of the Cuban government. He did not explain why he was enlisted by Cuba's secret service and answered several questions with, ``I'll pass on that.''<ep>
   Overall, his statements did not differ significantly from the information made public Monday by foundation leaders.<ep>
   Martin appeared to be jittery about the press conference. The session was set for 2:30 p.m. at foundation headquarters, but Martin refused to speak at that time. Ninety minutes later, he agreed to speak, but at the Hyatt Regency. Three hours later, after hurried arrangements were made, he appeared at that Coral Gables hotel.<ep>
   Martin estimated that between 50 and 60 Cuban secret agents operate in Miami. Many more have infiltrated exile organizations, he said, and others have been ``planted'' for use later.<ep>
   He said he has worked as an unpaid informer for the FBI for the past year. The FBI declined to comment.<ep>
   Martin said the evidence he turned over to the foundation and Miami police is sufficiently strong to corroborate his allegations.<ep>
