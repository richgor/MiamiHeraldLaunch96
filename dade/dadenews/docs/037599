<m0>   Now it's official.<ep>
   Neville Henry Peter, 23, is a jazz singer.<ep>
   Cristina Pellerano, 22, is an actress.<ep>
   And Melenie J. Lankau, 30, is a college professor.<ep>
   A few words Friday from University of Miami President Edward ``Tad'' Foote made their career choices actual careers, their childhood dreams, reality. It was graduation day.<ep>
   ``This is just the final benediction to send us out into the world,'' Pellerano said, before jumping fully clothed into UM's fountain (--) a graduation ritual at the Coral Gables campus.<ep>
   ``New York, here we go!'' And to the fountain she went, drenching her black gown and cap, her white high-top sneakers and her dainty pearl necklace.<ep>
   Pellerano is one of only four students who graduated with a degree in the performing arts. Twenty students began the program four years ago; 16 dropped out.<ep>
   ``It was tough, tough, tough, but we made it,'' said Jordan White, 22, dripping water from head to toes.<ep>
   As the four posed for what could be the smallest class picture ever taken, a festive mood was quickly taking hold over the entire campus.<ep>
   In front of grinning parents and proud professors, students, now graduates, gulped down $26 bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne as if it were Perrier water. Couples embraced and kissed with the sort of intimacy more common to Champs Elysee than to San Amaro Road.<ep>
   Minutes before, 2,351 graduates had sat still in a perfectly sunny South Florida morning as Foote and others conferred degrees on them and challenged them to do good.<ep>
   No one asked more of the students than Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, president of Barry University and the morning's speaker.<ep>
   ``Be aware,'' she told them. ``Be attentive and take action. Offer welcome and offer hope.''<ep>
   Some graduates already are much involved in the real world.<ep>
   Caryn Vogel, a 25-year-old from New Jersey who just received a law degree, will remain in Miami working as a lawyer for the indigent and the sick, said her mother Carol Vogel, as she wiped a tear or two.<ep>
   ``I'm real proud of her,'' she said.<ep>
   Peter, the jazz singer who has been blind since childhood, has already performed all over the country and Japan and plans to move to New York to find work.<ep>
   Lankau, the professor, is the mother of a 4-month-old boy and already has a job teaching management at Cornell University.<ep>
   Jorge Ramos, a 38-year-old from Mexico who received a master's degree in international studies, will continue doing what he does best: anchoring the news at Univision, the international Spanish-language network based in Miami.<ep>
   Because of his job, it took him three years to finish his studies. Because of his job, he knows firsthand the issues that affect the world.<ep>
   A few steps from where Ramos sat, his 9-year-old daughter Paola kept her eyes glued to the ceremony. At the end, Ramos asked his daughter to throw his cap into the air.<ep>
   ``I wanted her to do this for me,'' he said. ``What better example of sacrifice and effort can I give her?''<ql>
