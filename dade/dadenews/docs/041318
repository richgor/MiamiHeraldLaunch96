Legislators in the bottom three quarters are listed alphabetically within their respective quarters. Those in the highest-ranked quarter received a four-star rating. The next quarter was assigned a three-star rating. The next-to-last quarter gets two stars. Bottom-quarter lawmakers get one star.<ql>
