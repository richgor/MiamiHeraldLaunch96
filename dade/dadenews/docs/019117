<ep>
<m0>  The Metro Commission also took up the following issues on Tuesday:<ep>
  (box) <m0>Police radios.<m0> Agreed to pay up to $400,000 to Omnicom of Tallahassee, which will try to improve performance of the county's troubled new police radio system. The $43 million GE/Ericsson digital system hasn't met expectations. The county has not paid the full $43 million.<ep>
  (box) <m0>Park development. <m0>Approved a $3.4 million project to rebuild two Miami parks. Moore Park, at Northwest Seventh Avenue and 38th Street, will get tournament-quality tennis courts, and Grapeland Heights Park, at Northwest 37th Avenue and 14th Street, will get at least five baseball fields. Each will get a community center.<ep>
  (box) <m0>Homestead Air Reserve Base. <m0>Commissioner James Burke withdrew a proposal that might have removed a 214-acre park in the air base project. The developers still oppose the park, however.<ep>
  (box) <m0>Orange Bowl. <m0>Allowed the Miami Sports and Exhibition Authority to spend $390,000 in hotel taxes to renovate the bathrooms in the Orange Bowl in preparation for Olympic soccer games.<ep>
  (box) <m0>Security gate. <m0>Approved a request by residents of Sunrise Harbour in Coral Gables for a special-taxing district to build a security guardhouse on East Sunrise Avenue west of Sunrise Place. Residents will vote June 25 on whether to create the district. The commission said the district could be enlarged, if surrounding neighbors vote next year to create their own taxing district.<ql>
