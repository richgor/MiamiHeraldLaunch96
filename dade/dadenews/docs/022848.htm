   While this jury hasn't heard it before, those who have followed the convoluted corruption case against Raul Martinez heard little that was new during closing arguments Tuesday in the Hialeah mayor's third trial.<P>

   Prosecutors again argued that Martinez is a political kingpin who coordinated payoffs for himself and his allies while running Dade's second-largest city. Through intimidation and coercion, they say, he traded zoning favors to developers for cash and land deals that netted him $182,000.<P>

   ``The circumstantial evidence in this case speaks volumes,'' prosecutor Bruce Udolf said, referring time and again to a lengthy paper trail of zoning approvals that prosecutors say generated checks for the mayor. ``Friends don't shake you down like that, ladies and gentleman. You'd have to believe in the tooth fairy to believe Raul Martinez didn't know what he was doing.''<P>

   Defense Attorney Jose Qui&ntilde;on, meanwhile, characterized Martinez as a political messiah who saved a city choking in debt. Because of his rising political stock and business savvy, Martinez profited about $134,000 during the 1980s, Qui&ntilde;on said. But there was nothing illegal about the deals.<P>

   ``The victim of the so-called crime answers the question for you,'' Qui&ntilde;on told jurors as he read testimony by the government's three key witnesses. ``There was no agreement, no understanding, no meeting of the minds. And there is no evidence here that they feared economic loss.''<P>

   Jurors must decide which interpretation is correct after they receive instructions today from Senior U.S. District Judge James Kehoe.<P>

   Martinez was indicted in 1990 and convicted the following year on six of eight federal extortion and racketeering charges. But appellate judges ordered a new trial in 1994, citing blatant jury misconduct and flawed jury instructions. That trial ended March 26 in a hung jury. The third trial began April 22.<P>

   About 50 people attended Tuesday's closings, including Hialeah resident Edward Guerra -- one of 11 jurors who voted to acquit Martinez during the second trial.<P>

   Because jurors in that case had questions on their instructions and ultimately deadlocked, Kehoe complied with prosecutors' demands Monday to clarify jury instructions. His new definition of extortion explains that circumstantial evidence alone is enough to convict.<P>

   Despite the new spin, Guerra's opinion hasn't changed.<P>

   ``The prosecution has changed their tactics,'' Guerra said. ``But I am still convinced that the mayor is not guilty.''
