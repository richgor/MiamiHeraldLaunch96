   Separated by only a makeshift counter, Little Havana jewelry store owner Emilio Malbaez and a robber exchanged gunfire Thursday afternoon, leaving the jeweler bloodied. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Miami police aren't sure if Malbaez hit the fleeing robber, but the 69-year-old was grazed by bullets on the bridge of his nose and right elbow. He was recovering Thursday at Jackson Memorial Hospital in stable condition.<ep>
   It is the second time Malbaez has been hit by gunfire and the third time he has been robbed at his small store, Emilio Joyeria at 1751 W. Flagler St.<ep>
   Police said the robber entered the jewelry store before 4:18 p.m. Thursday and demanded money and jewelry. Malbaez then pulled out his gun. The two exchanged gunfire, and the robber fled in a blue 1975 Chevrolet Impala with tinted windows.<ep>
   Malbaez went to Soraya Fashion Children's Wear next door. Employee Estelle Manresa was in the store when Malbaez, his face covered with blood, ran to the store's doorstep and asked for help. Manresa called police and brought a chair outside so Malbaez could sit and not faint near an outside rack of children's clothes selling for $5.<ep>
   Blood stained the sidewalk and the entranceway of the fashion store.<ep>
   ``I thought I was going to have a heart attack,'' Manresa said hours later. ``Look at my face, I'm still horrified.''<ep>
   Malbaez was shot for the first time in 1977, and doctors thought he would be crippled. The bullet is still inside his body, said his wife Dinella, who didn't specify where. But he wasn't crippled and returned to work.<ep>
   ``I asked him to quit the business,'' his wife said. ``But he told me he wanted me to live comfortably. His passion is that I don't want for anything.''<ep>
