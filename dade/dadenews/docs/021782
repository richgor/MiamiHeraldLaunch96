<m1><ue5><m0>Six migrants repatriated after rescue<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   Six Cuban migrants were repatriated to <m0>Bahi de Cabanas, Cuba, <m0>on Sunday, four days after being rescued from a sinking tugboat 54 miles southeast of Andros Island.<ep>
   The migrants were spotted by a Coast Guard plane Thursday, said Petty Officer Scott Carr. The Coast Guard cutter Padre was dispatched to meet the 35-foot tugboat, where they gave the migrants food, water and medical attention.<ep>
   ``They immediately took them on board when they saw the boat was taking on water,'' Carr said.<ep>
   The rescue brings the total number of Cuban migrants rescued at sea to 95 this year, Carr said.<ql>

<m0>   Two men, at least one with a gun, on Monday robbed the Mayor's jewelry store on Miracle Mile in <m0>Coral Gables <m0>and stole merchandise worth more than $20,000, police said.<ep>
   The gunman whipped out a firearm when an employee was showing jewelry to a customer and stole several items. No one was injured during the incident.<ep>
   The store manager would not comment.<ql>

<ue5><m0>Shot in stomach, Miami man dies<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   A man died Monday night at Jackson Memorial Hospital from a gunshot wound.<ep>
   A caller notified police about 5:40 p.m. that a person was shot near Northwest First Court and 16th Street. When police arrived, they found a man shot in the stomach, Miami police said. Another man at the scene said he fired the shot.<ep>
   The victim, whose name was not released, was transported to Jackson Memorial in critical condition. The victim immediately had surgery but later died, said Darlene Crawford, a hospital spokeswoman.<ep>
   Police say they are questioning witnesses and the suspect.<ep>
   Anyone with information is urged to call Miami police at 579-6530, or Crimestoppers at 471-TIPS.<ql>

<m1><ue5><m0>Metro rescinds self-imposed port fine<ql>
<m1><ue5><styl>indentl,2l,0,3p3,3p3<ql>
<ep>
<m0>  When Dade County building officials discovered earlier this year that the Port of Miami had built two passenger terminals without proper building permits, the county fined itself $17,159 for violating the South Florida Building Code. But Port Director Carmen Lunetta won't have to pay.<ep>
   Guillermo Olmedillo, acting director of Metro's Department of Planning Development and Regulation, said Monday he rescinded the fine after determining that former Metro building official Carlos Bonzon authorized the construction.<ep>
   ``I couldn't very well go out and fine someone who had this verification,'' Olmedillo said.<ep>
   The state Department of Business & Professional Regulation launched an investigation of the case in March. Olmedillo said he was interviewed last week by an investigator. Bonzon contends he acted within his authority.<ql>

<m1><ue5><m0>No plans to fill sinkhole<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   There were no immediate plans Monday to fill the Miramar sinkhole, as homeowners and developer Lennar reached a standoff on a plan to test for debris under homes.<ep>
   A third plan of action submitted by Lennar late Friday still did not call for testing under every house in Hampshire Homes (--) something homeowners are adamant about. They don't want the pit filled in until Lennar agrees to the testing.<ep>
   The Department of Natural Resource Protection also found Lennar's latest plan lacked one detail: a record of how and when the garbage was buried on the site.<ep>
