   Investigative TV reporter Mark Hyman -- whose series about videotaped confessions, I Confess, just aired on WFOR-Channel 4 -- has his own date in court.<P>

   Miami police charged Hyman, 42, with driving under the influence. Hyman maintains he wasn't under the influence of anything, drugs or alcohol. <P>

   From Miami police officer Mario Garcia's report: ``I first observed [him] at Biscayne Boulevard and 67th Street attempting to pick up a known prostitute.''<P>

   Garcia says he followed Hyman's Honda Accord and watched him pick up a man at Northeast 79th Street and Third Court at 1:45 a.m. The officer says he stopped Hyman because the car had a broken rear tail light and Hyman twice turned without signaling. ``He appeared to be highly agitated,'' Garcia wrote. ``His pulse was 102.''<P>

   Hyman's boss, Channel 4 VP and general manager Allen Shaklan, and Hyman's attorney Don Bierman say it's a case of ``wrong place, wrong time.'' Says Bierman: Hyman ``was working on a story on what goes on with open drug sales on Biscayne Boulevard and how there's no enforcement. I think the cops figured he was somebody picking up a hooker.''<P>

   Adds Shaklan: ``We stand behind him.'' He declined to discuss the drug story Hyman was working on, which has yet to air. <P>

   Hyman passed the breath test measuring blood alcohol with flying colors, says Bierman. He's awaiting the results of a urine test administered by police, but adds that Hyman came up clean on a test administered privately the next day.<P>

   Hyman is scheduled for arraignment May 17 before Dade Circuit Judge Ellen Sue Venzer.<BR>
Party, party, party<P>

   Get out your beach blanket, baby! Rock 'n' roll legend Little Richard and R & B diva Chaka Khan will perform on South Beach, at 10th Street and Ocean Drive, at 8 p.m. June 15. <P>

   Unlike the Pavarotti on the Beach concert, which commanded ticket prices as high as $2,500, the priciest tickets are $100. That gets you into a night-before VIP reception at Salvation, a South Beach club, a preperformance cocktail reception at the concert site, and VIP seating.<P>

   Reserved seats go at $80 and $50, first-come, first-served. General admission tix are $35. The sand, way back, is free.<P>

   Both artists are Grammy Award winners. Chaka Khan won for Ain't Nobody, I Feel for You  and The Woman I Am. Another hit: I'm Every Woman, remade by Whitney Houston.<P>

   Little Richard, once a dishwasher in a Greyhound bus station, scored a Lifetime Achievement Grammy in '93. Sporting a pompadour in 1956, he recorded Tutti-Frutti, which launched a parade of 21 chart hits including Long Tall Sally, Lucille  and Good Golly, Miss Molly.<P>

   Tickets are available through Ticketmaster.<BR>
How 'bout a Tums?<P>

      Miami Police Chief Don Warshaw's latest honor? Winner of the ``Heartburn Pressure Poll.''<P>

   ``I thought it was a hoax,'' says Warshaw. The chief learned about it when he got a call from cops at the front desk at headquarters. ``They told me there was someone in the lobby dressed like a box of Zantac. I said, `Better check 'em out.' ''<P>

   It was for real. Warner-Wellcome Consumer Health Care, which makes over-the-counter Zantac 75, a heartburn relief medicine, sponsored the promotion in 10 U.S. cities.<P>

   After a local vote at Aventura Mall, Warshaw beat out his boss, City Manager Cesar Odio, along with Miami Mayor Steve Clark and Gov. Lawton Chiles. Other winners: New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, L.A. Police Chief Willie Williams and Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk.<P>

   Warshaw's prize: a year's supply of Zantac. Thanks, but no thanks, says the chief. ``I have a pretty strong stomach. I don't take antacids.''<P>

   Warner-Wellcome told Warshaw it would donate $5,000 to charity. Warshaw suggested Do the Right Thing, the American Cancer Society, Children's Home Society and Informed Families.<BR>
Need a lawyer?<BR>
<P>

   Ronald J. Fath, lawyer and former Miami cop, got busted. The charges: forgery and grand theft for allegedly filing a fraudulent insurance claim in the name of his dead mother.<P>

   Fath, 61, of Tybee Island, Ga., reported to Allstate in December 1992 that burglars stole $7,000 worth of valuables -- sterling silver, a Minolta camera and Sony camcorder -- from his mother's Miami home. Fath told the insurance company that his mother was living in Savannah, Ga. Truth was, she had died in September, three months before he filed the claim.<P>

   Allstate issued a $742.86 check for the camcorder and camera, but refused to pay a claim on the silver without an appraisal. Several months later, investigators say, Allstate received a notarized affidavit from a Gilbert T. Sullivan valuing the silver at $5,000. They were suspicious because the handwriting on Sullivan's affidavit appeared to match that on Fath's handwritten letter.<P>

   Investigators also found out that the notary, Ellen Grasso, never notarized the document. Grasso, a former secretary at High Stack Lazenby, told investigators she left the seal behind when she stopped working for the law firm. <P>

   Charles ``Bud'' Stack says Fath was not a lawyer with the firm, but worked as a law clerk while on one of his three suspensions from the Florida Bar. ``We were trying to give him a break,'' Stack says.<P>

   Stack got a bad break himself Thursday. Because of a political furor, he withdrew his name as a Clinton nominee for a federal judgeship on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.<BR>
