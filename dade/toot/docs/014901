<m0>   In Dade Circuit Court, actor <m0>Sylvester Stallone <m0>is suing his stepfather <m0>Anthony Filiti, <m0>claiming Filiti ripped him off for almost $10 million while acting as his financial adviser and business manager.<ep>
   It comes on the heels of a $50 million lawsuit Filiti filed against Stallone in Los Angeles, claiming Sly defamed and wrongfully fired him.<ep>
   Filiti says he helped raise and support Stallone from age 12. Filiti used to be married to Sly's mother.<ep>
    Stallone, 49, says he hired Filiti, 70, in February 1991 for $400,000 a year, according to the suit filed by Miami lawyer <m0>I. Stanley Levine.<ep>
<m0>  Filiti, he says, promised to invest ``conservatively'' and get Stallone's consent before making deals. ``Based on this position of trust, Stallone gave Filiti complete control over Stallone's financial affairs,'' says the suit. <ep>
   Instead, says Stallone, Filiti made high-risk, self-serving investments. Among them: <m1> <ep>
<m0>   (box) $2.75 million in <m0>Rookie Vampyre,<m0> a low-budget film, despite Stallone's failure to approve the investment.<ep>
   (box) $4 million in a bank CD (--) at 5 percent interest (--) to be used to secure the bank's loan to a cheese company. The lawsuit alleges that Filiti's firm, Philadelphia-based AB Management, got cheese company stock for pledging Stallone's CD as collateral.<ep>
  Another claim: Filiti misappropriated at least $2.6 million from Stallone's accounts, charging personal expenses for a lady friend, $3,000-a night hotel rooms, rental sports cars and lingerie from Victoria's Secret. <ep>
   In all, the suit says, Filiti doctored the books to show paper gains, gave himself a 10 percent commission, and drew a salary of more than $1 million a year ``without Stallone's knowledge or authorization.''<ep>
   After Stallone canned Filiti last December, Filiti continued to use Stallone's credit cards through February. Stallone's negligence suit asks for an accounting (--) and compensatory damages.<ep>
   Filiti claims Stallone's profits rose ``from zero to $80 million'' (--) not counting his film earnings (--) during his tenure as a financial director. His attorney is <m0>Bertram Fields, <m0>whose clients have included <m0>The Beatles, Michael Jackson <m0>and <m0>Tom Cruise.<m0> ``Mr. Filiti did a terrific job for Mr. Stallone,'' says Fields.<ep>
   Filiti calls Sly's suit ``nonsense.'' Says Filiti: ``If he wants to be stupid, that's his problem. Life goes on.''<ep>
   Stallone's Los Angeles-based publicist <m0>Paul Bloch, <m0>and Stallone's lawyer, Levine, both had the same comment: ``The lawsuit speaks for itself.''<ep>
   If lawsuits speak, does money talk?<ql>

<m0>  Another brush with the law for <m0>Robert Leslie Derringer, <m0>an ex-Metro homicide detective who served time in the Cocaine Cops scandal.<ep>
    Undercover vice officers busted Derringer, 46, on a misdemeanor charge of running a pyramid game out of his Southwest Dade home. Also arrested: Derringer's wife <m0>Debbie, <m0>46.<ep>
   Cops seized $5,000 cash as evidence, along with charts and a blackboard outlining the pyramids. They allowed about 80 ``investors'' to leave. The couple was released from jail after each posted $500 bond. <ep>
   Derringer, one of eight homicide detectives accused of working for drug kingpin <m0>Mario Escandar,<m0> got six years in prison in 1982 for tax fraud and stealing cash from the police property room. <ep>
   Husband and wife have separate arraignments Thursday; he before Dade County Judge <m0>Wendall Graham, <m0>she before before County Judge <m0>Caryn Schwartz.<m0><ql>

<m0>   Trip-down-the-aisle No. 4 for <m0>Ron Guralnick,<m0> criminal defense lawyer. Guralnick, 57, married <m0>Stephanie Gertner, <m0>42, a school psychologist.<ep>
   About 80 friends attended the April 27 black-tie ceremony on a beach behind the Coconut Grove home of attorney <m0>Ron Strauss, <m0>Guralnick's childhood friend. Strauss was best man, and Gertner's sister, <m0>Marilyn Shatz, <m1> <m0>maid of honor.<ep>
   The couple met five years ago on a fix-up. ``First blind date I ever had in my life,'' says Guralnick. ``She didn't like me before I got there because she didn't like lawyers.''<ep>
  She changed her mind. The couple honeymooned for a week at Hawk's Cay Resort in the Florida Keys. But, as they say, the honeymoon is over. Guralnick is defending <m0>Labrant ``Anthony'' Dennis, <m0>accused of murdering UM linebacker <m0>Marlin Barnes <m0>and companion <m0>Timwanika Lumpkins.<ql>
<m0>Book report<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   A brief homecoming for <m0>Thane Rosenbaum, <m0>Miami Beach Senior High class of '78. Rosenbaum, 36, bailed out of a lucrative career as a Wall Street corporate lawyer to try his hand at writing fiction.<ep>
   He will read from his first book <m0>Elijah Visible, <m0>published by St. Martin's Press, at 8 p.m. Friday at Books & Books in Coral Gables.<ep>
   It's a collection of short stories revolving around a central character named Adam Posner, who, not surprisingly, has much in common with Rosenbaum (--) skilled tennis player, lawyer and keen observer of the effects of the Holocaust.<ep>
   Rosenbaum is the only child of Holocaust survivors. Mother <m0>Betty, <m0>a Maidanek concentration camp survivor, met her husband, <m0>Norman, <m0>a Bergen-Belsen survivor, in post-war Germany. She died here in '81 of pancreatic cancer. He died two months later of a heart attack.<ep>
  Rosenbaum says his parents rarely discussed the Holocaust. ``It was almost like a floodgate that didn't want to be tampered with.'' He let it alone (--) ``an internal understanding and a shocking lack of curiosity,'' Rosenbaum says now. ``They were healing themselves.''<ep>
   Rosenbaum is now a professor at Fordham Law School, where he teaches writing and human rights.<ql>
