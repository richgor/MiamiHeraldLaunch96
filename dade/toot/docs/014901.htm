<!-- end headlines -->

   In Dade Circuit Court, actor Sylvester Stallone is suing his stepfather Anthony Filiti, claiming Filiti ripped him off for almost $10 million while acting as his financial adviser and business manager.<P>

   It comes on the heels of a $50 million lawsuit Filiti filed against Stallone in Los Angeles, claiming Sly defamed and wrongfully fired him.<P>

   Filiti says he helped raise and support Stallone from age 12. Filiti used to be married to Sly's mother.<P>

    Stallone, 49, says he hired Filiti, 70, in February 1991 for $400,000 a year, according to the suit filed by Miami lawyer I. Stanley Levine.<P>

  Filiti, he says, promised to invest ``conservatively'' and get Stallone's consent before making deals. ``Based on this position of trust, Stallone gave Filiti complete control over Stallone's financial affairs,'' says the suit. <P>

   Instead, says Stallone, Filiti made high-risk, self-serving investments. Among them:    <LI> $2.75 million in Rookie Vampyre, a low-budget film, despite Stallone's failure to approve the investment.<P>

   <LI> $4 million in a bank CD -- at 5 percent interest -- to be used to secure the bank's loan to a cheese company. The lawsuit alleges that Filiti's firm, Philadelphia-based AB Management, got cheese company stock for pledging Stallone's CD as collateral.<P>

  Another claim: Filiti misappropriated at least $2.6 million from Stallone's accounts, charging personal expenses for a lady friend, $3,000-a night hotel rooms, rental sports cars and lingerie from Victoria's Secret. <P>

   In all, the suit says, Filiti doctored the books to show paper gains, gave himself a 10 percent commission, and drew a salary of more than $1 million a year ``without Stallone's knowledge or authorization.''<P>

   After Stallone canned Filiti last December, Filiti continued to use Stallone's credit cards through February. Stallone's negligence suit asks for an accounting -- and compensatory damages.<P>

   Filiti claims Stallone's profits rose ``from zero to $80 million'' -- not counting his film earnings -- during his tenure as a financial director. His attorney is Bertram Fields, whose clients have included The Beatles, Michael Jackson and Tom Cruise. ``Mr. Filiti did a terrific job for Mr. Stallone,'' says Fields.<P>

   Filiti calls Sly's suit ``nonsense.'' Says Filiti: ``If he wants to be stupid, that's his problem. Life goes on.''<P>

   Stallone's Los Angeles-based publicist Paul Bloch, and Stallone's lawyer, Levine, both had the same comment: ``The lawsuit speaks for itself.''<P>

   If lawsuits speak, does money talk?<BR>
Double trouble<BR>
<P>

  Another brush with the law for Robert Leslie Derringer, an ex-Metro homicide detective who served time in the Cocaine Cops scandal.<P>

    Undercover vice officers busted Derringer, 46, on a misdemeanor charge of running a pyramid game out of his Southwest Dade home. Also arrested: Derringer's wife Debbie, 46.<P>

   Cops seized $5,000 cash as evidence, along with charts and a blackboard outlining the pyramids. They allowed about 80 ``investors'' to leave. The couple was released from jail after each posted $500 bond. <P>

   Derringer, one of eight homicide detectives accused of working for drug kingpin Mario Escandar, got six years in prison in 1982 for tax fraud and stealing cash from the police property room. <P>

   Husband and wife have separate arraignments Thursday; he before Dade County Judge Wendall Graham, she before before County Judge Caryn Schwartz.<BR>
I do, I do, I do, I do<BR>
<P>

   Trip-down-the-aisle No. 4 for Ron Guralnick, criminal defense lawyer. Guralnick, 57, married Stephanie Gertner, 42, a school psychologist.<P>

   About 80 friends attended the April 27 black-tie ceremony on a beach behind the Coconut Grove home of attorney Ron Strauss, Guralnick's childhood friend. Strauss was best man, and Gertner's sister, Marilyn Shatz, maid of honor.<P>

   The couple met five years ago on a fix-up. ``First blind date I ever had in my life,'' says Guralnick. ``She didn't like me before I got there because she didn't like lawyers.''<P>

  She changed her mind. The couple honeymooned for a week at Hawk's Cay Resort in the Florida Keys. But, as they say, the honeymoon is over. Guralnick is defending Labrant ``Anthony'' Dennis, accused of murdering UM linebacker Marlin Barnes and companion Timwanika Lumpkins.<BR>
Book report<BR>
<P>

   A brief homecoming for Thane Rosenbaum, Miami Beach Senior High class of '78. Rosenbaum, 36, bailed out of a lucrative career as a Wall Street corporate lawyer to try his hand at writing fiction.<P>

   He will read from his first book Elijah Visible, published by St. Martin's Press, at 8 p.m. Friday at Books & Books in Coral Gables.<P>

   It's a collection of short stories revolving around a central character named Adam Posner, who, not surprisingly, has much in common with Rosenbaum -- skilled tennis player, lawyer and keen observer of the effects of the Holocaust.<P>

   Rosenbaum is the only child of Holocaust survivors. Mother Betty, a Maidanek concentration camp survivor, met her husband, Norman, a Bergen-Belsen survivor, in post-war Germany. She died here in '81 of pancreatic cancer. He died two months later of a heart attack.<P>

  Rosenbaum says his parents rarely discussed the Holocaust. ``It was almost like a floodgate that didn't want to be tampered with.'' He let it alone -- ``an internal understanding and a shocking lack of curiosity,'' Rosenbaum says now. ``They were healing themselves.''<P>

   Rosenbaum is now a professor at Fordham Law School, where he teaches writing and human rights.<BR>
