PATRICIA CONNELLY<BR>
Leads project that brings<BR>
gifts to confined elderly<BR>
<P>

   Patricia Connelly of South Dade was a winner in the adult division for her extensive community commitment and for The Holiday Project, which she leads locally.<P>

   The Holiday Project is a national organization where volunteers visit and bring gifts to people who are confined to nursing homes, hospitals and other institutions. In 1995, more than 19,000 elderly Dade residents were visited by project volunteers.<P>

   Connelly's volunteer work includes public relations, recruitment, community outreach, fund-raising and gift procurement. She visits the elderly confined to nursing homes, hospitals and other institutions.<P>

   ``I'm so proud to receive this award,'' she said. The award was only one event Connelly was celebrating April 26. ``It's a double pleasure for me because my son Michael Cropper is graduating from Florida Atlantic University today,'' she said.<BR>
CHANTAL BOURGOIGNE<BR>
An advocate in courts<BR>
for abused, neglected kids<BR>
<P>

   Chantal Bourgoigne, also a winner in the adult category, is a volunteer for the Guardian Ad Litem program, an advocacy for abused, neglected and abandoned children in the courts. <P>

   The Kendall woman supports the program as a court advocate and by organizing social functions. She also is a founding member of Voices for Children, a nonprofit organization that supports the Guardian Ad Litem program by raising funds to meet basic needs of abused and neglected children, to send kids to camp and to pay for specialty needs such as tutoring.<P>

   Bourgoigne, an eight-year volunteer who gives 60 hours a month to the program, was cited for her long service, creativity and initiative and her tireless advocacy on behalf of children. She conducts investigations regarding the children, learns about their backgrounds and the problems they have and makes recommendations to the court regarding custody and services. She then monitors the court orders to ensure they are carried out.<P>

   She is fluent in French, relates well to Haitian children and their Creole-speaking families in the program, and helps teach the staff about Haitian culture.<P>

   Bourgoigne was out of town when the award was presented.<BR>
WILLIAM AND<BR>
LILLIAN HOLLIS<BR>
Began tutoring program<BR>
for teenagers at ICARE<BR>
   <P>

    William and Lillian Hollis, both in their 70s, received the award in the senior category for their work with ICARE Bay Point Schools near Saga Bay.<P>

   The couple, who travel from their home in New York each winter to spend four months in South Dade, contribute their time and efforts helping volunteers, staff and juvenile offenders at the site.<P>

   The original mission of ICARE -- Interfaith Coalition for the Andrew Recovery Effort -- was to help the uninsured, underinsured and elderly rebuild from Hurricane Andrew. As that work wound down, ICARE won a grant from the state to house juvenile offenders at the site. <P>

   Lillian Hollis started a tutoring program for the teenagers, since the school isn't accredited yet. She also recruits tutors and schedules them with the students one-on-one. William Hollis, a retired Navy chaplain, offers his support to anyone who needs a helping hand or a sympathetic ear.<P>

   The couple also do a lot of cooking for the youth and staff. <P>

   ``I'm very excited and surprised,'' William said. ``They asked us to give of our talent, so we worked in the kitchen.<P>

   ``I'm speechless,'' said Lillian.<P>

<BR>

SUZETTE POPE<BR>
Active in taking care<BR>
of low-income elderly<BR>
<P>

   Suzette Pope, a volunteer for the Bay Oaks Miami Soroptimist Home for the Aged, is no stranger to volunteerism. <P>

   An award winner in the senior category, Pope has been a volunteer for more than 40 years. She began a ministry to the elderly through her church in 1960 and led small groups to serve elderly in nursing homes. She joined Soroptimist in 1971 and learned about Bay Oaks, a long-term club project.<P>

   Bay Oaks Home at 435 NE 34th St., provides total care and serves the low-income needy elderly of all races and religions.<P>

    Pope, who lives in the Little Havana area, has been an active trustee and volunteer involved in every aspect of Bay Oaks' operation. She has expanding activities for residents, involved residents in education and medical programs, sponsored parties, implemented cost-cutting measures, strengthened office procedures and helped reduce the deficit.<P>

   Pope, who was out of town and did not attend the awards ceremony, has been active in dozens of civic, service and business organizations at the local level and in service and job-related professional organizations at state, regional and national levels.<BR>
CARLOS FRANCISCO BARCIA<BR>
Found a diamond<BR>
in the rough<BR>
<P>

  Carlos Francisco Barcia of the South Miami area, a member of Boy Scout Troop 362, received the award in the youth category for designing and creating a professional baseball field at David Fairchild Elementary School.<P>

   Carlos, now 15, asked Principal Barry M. Liebovitz if he could work on the field as a Scout service project. Carlos spent many hours in planning the project, raising money for it and putting in the physical labor. He solicited donations from community businesses and secured the remaining money by having doughnut and coffee sales on weekends.<P>

   Judges noted that the impact of the project was far-reaching. Not only do South Miami Middle students use it, but the area YMCA uses the field for its baseball sports activities. <P>

   ``There are a lot of people in the community who give of their services. I didn't know I'd win. I'm surprised,'' Carlos said.<P>

   The project also helped him earn the highest Boy Scout honor, the rank of Eagle Scout.<BR>
RAY ZELLER<BR>
Teaches at-risk students<BR>
leadership, self-esteem<BR>
<P>

   Ray Zeller received the education category award for his volunteer efforts for Kids In Dade Society (KIDS). As president of the 6-year-old organization, he directs its annual calendar of activities and fund-raising efforts.<P>

   KIDS, at 2851 Coral Way, provides correction and rehabilitation for at-risk students from Goulds to North Miami. Its program includes self-discipline, self-esteem, developing leadership skills, public speaking, community service programs, Youth Crime Watch and involvement in summer youth programs.<P>

  Fourteen schools participate in KIDS-sponsored Florida Youth Cadets program. Judges were impressed that youngsters improve in school attendance, academics, behavior and community service and many have gone on to senior high school ROTC programs and some become applicants for appointments to U.S. military academies.<P>

      Zeller, who lives in the Little Havana area, also serves as the school advisory committee chairman of J.R.E. Lee Youth Opportunity School and is a member of numerous community organizations. <P>

   ``You work so many years and so many hours and something like this happens and you really appreciate it,'' Zeller said. ``It makes you feel like somebody was watching.''<BR>
ASPIRA OF FLORIDA<BR>
Focuses on keeping kids<BR>
in school, out of trouble<BR>
<P>

    In the corporate category, Aspira of Florida, 3650 N. Miami Ave., won for its work in providing services each year to about 1,500 Hispanic and other minority youth age 7 to 19. Aspira's director is Raul Martinez.<P>

   Its priorities are dropout prevention, substance abuse awareness, gang avoidance, alternative education, leadership and development. Activities include club meetings, counseling, home visits, community service, educational field trips, workshop, tutoring and job training.<P>

   Through awareness, analysis and action, read the nomination, the Puerto Rican/Latino organization of community leaders and parents who are dedicated to cultivating youth, empowers youth to bring change to themselves and to the community.<P>

   Judges were impressed with the organization's two youth sanctuaries, one in Wynwood and one in a South Dade labor camp, whose activities include education, sports, computers, art and Girl Scouting.<P>

   During the past year, Aspira recruited 1,261 at-risk students from 27 school and community clubs of which nearly all were encouraged to stay in school.
