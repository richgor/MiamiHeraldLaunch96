   Bugs are flying around Norland High these days (--) and they're being welcomed with open doors.<ep>
   That's because the winged creatures (--) also known as fruit flies, <m0>Drosophila Melanogaster<m0> (--) are part of an experiment. Six weeks ago, biology teacher Joseph Weinbaum proposed the idea to his students.<ep>
   ``The flies are simple and harmless. They've also got a long history in being used for research in genetics,'' said Weinbaum, who teaches at the school, 1050 NW 195th St. ``They pose endless possibilities for research.'' <ep>
   The experiment: To see what environment fruit flies like to lay their eggs (--) or pupae (--) in. Among the substances used in the experiment were vitamins, perfume and fruit. Tenth-grader Shevon Howard tested six different types of vitamins to see which one the flies preferred.<ep>
   His findings?<ep>
   ``I tried vitamins like iron and Vitamin C and Lactase,'' Shevon said. ``But the one they seemed to like the most was natural Vitamin C that's found in orange juice. My conclusion was that I found 96 pupae leftover after the six weeks.''<ep>
   Weinbaum figured the students would have fun with the experiment, while at the same time mastering the scientific method. For Danny Schofield, a student in the school's gifted program, working with flies was something new.<ep>
   ``It was kind of irritating at first,'' Danny said. ``Everybody was like, `Ah (--) there's flies everywhere!' But then we started learning from them. It was good to do something new.''<ep>
   Students tried a variety of perfumes, too. Weinbaum said the flies were indifferent to Topango Mango body spray and Halston cologne, among other scents.<ep>
   ``Now, Colgate toothpaste (--) they didn't mind that,'' Weinbaum said, looking at students' reports. ``Elizabeth Taylor's Passion was another story. That one scored lowest on the list.''<ep>
   The flies (--) which usually swarm around outside on campus this time of year (--) were trapped into pint-size containers filled with a mixture of yeast and water. Then, whatever substances were being tested (--) like chunks of apples and oranges (--) were dropped in. A cotton ball was added to the top of the water bottles to keep the flies from getting out, although many did so anyway.<ep>
   ``It's cheap and easy to do (--) just find a place where there are a lot of flies,'' said Weinbaum. ``They're much happier, though, if you leave them alone and don't bug them.''<ep>
