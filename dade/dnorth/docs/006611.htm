OUT AND AROUND<BR>
<BR>
Eugene J. Patron<BR>
<BR>
<P>

  The story of gay and lesbian community building on Miami Beach is attracting national attention. During a recent visit to the city, members of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation's National Fellowship Program got to meet with a representative of the gay community at a luncheon at the Foundlings Club.<P>

     Attorney Edward McIntyre, a board member of the Dade Human Rights Foundation, joined Marcia Zerivitz, director of the Ziff Jewish Museum, Ilona Wiss, a coordinator of the South Pointe Citizens Coalition and some senior citizens in addressing the ``role of leaders in creating caring communities.'' <P>

    The program gives professionals from various walks of life the opportunity to develop a broader knowledge and experience on topics of national and international concern.<P>

     During a three-year period, Fellows make seven trips to study various communities. Fifteen fellows participated in the Miami Beach discussion.<P>

    ``Many of the Fellows are focused on minority groups and they were very interested to hear how gays and lesbians were able to build a community amongst themselves and then mesh that community with the community at large,'' McIntyre says.<P>

  ``A point I was trying to get across to them was that unlike a minority based on skin color or ethnicity, being gay is not something self evident. The first step is to acknowledge your own status and realize that there are others like you.<P>

     ``As you begin to develop a common culture and community, then comes the question of how to mesh that in with the rest of society in a productive fashion.'' <P>

  John Beineke, associate director of the Fellowship Program, was very pleased with the dialogue.<P>

     ``Our Fellows always become very engaged with the individuals they meet. Diversity is something very important to leadership and the Fellows took very seriously what people had to say.''<BR>
Breast cancer study<BR>
<P>

  One of the first studies to look at the special needs of lesbian breast cancer survivors is being conducted by the University of Miami's Department of Psychology. The study is parallel to a larger study examining breast cancer in women in general. <P>

  ``It has long been recognized that the lesbian population has been undeserved when it comes to health care needs,'' says researcher, Susan Yount. ``We're trying to ascertain information on how participants feel their sexual orientation influences the kind of medical care they receive, what social support they find, the response of their partners and their stress levels.<P>

     ``We want to learn how they cope and adjust to their diagnosis and treatment.'' <P>

  Lesbians from around the country who have ever been diagnosed with breast cancer are being asked to complete a questionnaire. The study pays $25 to those who do.<P>

     Local women are additionally being asked to come to the university for a confidential interview with researchers. <P>

  For more information, contact the UM research team at 284-2220, or (800) 917-2698.<BR>
