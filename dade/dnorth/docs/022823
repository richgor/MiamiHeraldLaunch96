<m0>   North Miami Beach residents and leaders will gather at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday to dedicate the city's high-tech police station, the centerpiece of the $13 million Public Safety 2000 bond passed in 1993.<ep>
   The city is also dedicating a playground on a third of an acre next to the station, which the city hopes will give parents an added sense of security. The playground, which has a ground cover made from recycled tires, is designed with distinct areas for toddlers, small children and older ones. <ep>
   At 42,000 square feet, the two-story police building, at 16901 NE 19th St., gives officers almost four times the space they had at the old building across the street.<ep>
   Among the improvements are a secure drop-off point for prisoners, better facilities for questioning witnesses and suspects, a dedicated training room, a community room for meetings and news conferences, locker rooms, a gym, a library and pass cards that control access to various areas of the station.<ep>
