 `BETTER THAN A MOTHER' <BR>
<BR>

Marjorie McDonald is the only director that Robert Sharp Towers has ever had, and she's now older than many of the residents.<BR>

DIFFERENT ROOTS: Now that she's retiring as director of the Robert Sharp Towers, a housing complex for seniors, Marjorie McDonald has more time to devote to her plants, which has become a favorite pastime.

   Nine years ago, after Mayor Marjorie McDonald came up short in a nasty North Miami Beach election, she swore off local politics.<P>

   McDonald, after all, had plenty to take care of at her full-time job managing the renowned Robert Sharp Towers, a subsidized housing complex for the elderly in North Dade.<P>

   Only now, at age 80, is she ready to slow down. ``I just decided 17 years was enough, and I wanted a life of my own,'' she said.<P>

   She's the only director that Robert Sharp Towers has ever had, and it'll be hard to tear herself away from the place, despite the fact that she's now older than many of the residents.<P>

   ``They'll come up to me and say, `Wait till you get to be my age and have all the aches and pains,' and I think, I'm older than they are,'' McDonald said.<P>

   She's already been persuaded to return Wednesday night when the tenants association inducts its new officers.<P>

   ``She's better than a mother to us,'' said Edward Akelaitis, a past president of the group.<P>

   Incoming President Lois Davis recalls how McDonald went out of her way to push the paperwork to admit her into the housing complex, even though McDonald wasn't feeling well. ``This is her baby,'' Davis said.<P>

   It had a rough gestation, though. Before the first building at 103 NW 202nd Ter. opened in 1979, activists protested that the 109-unit complex would drag down the neighborhood.<P>

   McDonald, then a City Council member heavily involved in programs for seniors, helped guide the $3 million project, and later was appointed director.<P>

   A twin building was added, and today, as the developers promised, visitors would never guess that the complex was federally subsidized, what with the neat landscaping and up-to-date lobbies.<P>

   ``It's like living in a high-class joint,'' says resident Willnett McNatt, who was chatting near the complex's pool at lunchtime Friday.<P>

   That pool, more than anything, perhaps, speaks to McDonald's drive.<P>

   From the start, she'd wanted that pool. ``I felt that was a way of life in Florida, and a lot of people have arthritis,'' so it wasn't a frill, McDonald reasons.<P>

   But the federal government refused. So she helped the tenants association build the pool itself, raising money with raffles, homemade gifts, bingo games -- even concerts by Dion, the rock-gospel singer whose parents, Pat and Frances DiMucci, live in the complex.<P>

   After six years, the residents had collected $38,000, and they got their pool.<P>

   That same year, McDonald was named top housing manager in the country by the National Council of Senior Citizens.<P>

   Residents praise her for getting people involved in projects like the pool. ``It was that way right from the start,'' says Fannie Harris, the current tenants association president and one of only a handful of residents who have been at the complex since it opened.<P>

   McNatt was lured from New York City. ``Rather than go home, I found myself living in Florida,'' she said.<P>

   She's ever thankful for the committee meetings and social activities that fill her days. ``Where I had lived, I never went out of my apartment,'' she said.<P>

   McDonald, for her part, is looking forward to spending several weeks in Michigan this summer with her daughter's family, and she'd like to put some of her papers and plaques together for her kids.<P>

   After that, though, she might be tempted to rev up her local role, she says.<P>

   In the last few weeks, McDonald was greeting her old City Hall chums at a lunch for Mayor Jeff Mishcon, and she appeared as usual at an annual scholarship breakfast as well.<P>

   ``I do keep a finger in,'' she said, ``so I probably will get back in.''
