<m0>   At age 12, David Copeland has written three books (--) and he's working on his next novel.<ep>
   The sixth-grader at Ojus Elementary has never won an award for his writing, but he has been able to hone his interest in the craft. <ep>
      ``I've written science fiction, adventure and a mystery,'' David said.<ep>
   David has been able to do this through the Landmark Books program at the school, 18600 W. Dixie Hwy.<ep>
   ``My favorite part is that you get to do your own illustrations, and you get to do a biography,'' <m1> <m0>he said.<ep>
   Students in the program write, illustrate and edit their own books. The process includes creating a book jacket and writing an author's autobiography for the jacket. Landmark Books holds a national contest at the end of each school year for its participants.<ep>
   ``It's a national program and it promotes critical thinking, vocabulary and writing,'' said Jeanne Friedman, principal of Ojus Elementary.<ep>
    The top five children receive full scholarships to college and get their books published, Friedman said. <m1><ep>
<m0>   On Friday, <m1> <m0>Ojus Elementary celebrated its involvement with Landmark Books at ``Young Authors' Day '96.'' Founder David Melton, an author and illustrator, conducted several workshops throughout the day for students and teachers.<ep>
   The program began at Ojus Elementary in 1991, under the direction of gifted program teacher Donita Gay. Since then, the school has made the program a mandatory element of its second-through-sixth-grade curriculum.<ep>
   ``Everyone has to do it,'' Friedman said. ``Our limited-English students start books in their native language, and it takes time, but it turns to English.''<ep>
   Friedman said the program instills responsibility, as the children must meet deadlines.<ep>
   ``You set goals to be ready to send it off to Kansas City by May 1,'' Friedman said. ``Landmark tells you to make a big deal out of the books, and we do. Parents get involved, too.''<ep>
   David's father, David Copeland Sr., 47, said he became involved with the program because he noticed a change in his children. Copeland also has a 9-year-old daughter, Diana, a third-grader, working on her second book.<ep>
   ``You can't help but get involved because your kids will bring the assignment home,'' Copeland said. ``It's a major project that takes months of their work. You can see the improvement in their story lines.''<ep>
   David enjoyed being a Landmark author so much that he plans to continue entering Landmark contests well after his graduation in June.<ep>
   ``I'm just going to do it by myself and send it in,'' he said. ``I think it's a very good thing they [Landmark Books] do.''<ep>
   Friedman agreed.<ep>
   ``This is truly a creation. We force them to finish it, and that's the nicest part. They actually bring it to completion. The children who say they can't draw can take pictures. Instead of an `I can't' [attitude], it's that they can.''<ep>
   Friedman said the most important aspect of the Landmark Books program is the increased self-esteem the children experience when seeing their books finished.<ep>
   ``I love the self-esteem growth the children get,'' Friedman said. ``You cannot put a price tag on the joy and achievement these children get.''<ep>
