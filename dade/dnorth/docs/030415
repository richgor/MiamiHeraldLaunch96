   With a financial boost from the state, Miami Shores police plan to target juvenile crime.<ep>
    The village has been awarded $150,000 from the state Department of Human Services, money that will be used to bolster programs that get teens involved in the community before they stumble into trouble.<ep>
   ``Some of our crime is being committed by gangs,'' said Chief Michael Zoovas. ``This money will be well spent to curtail juvenile crime.''<ep>
<m0>Expanding DARE program<ep>
<m0>   The money will be used to expand the DARE program (--) Drug Abuse Resistance Education (--) and to implement a cadet program for youth. In the cadet program, teens will be able to ride with police officers and have a chance to learn more about police work.<ep>
   ``It gives them greater community awareness and it provides role models,'' said village manager Michael Couzzo.<ep>
   The village also wants to begin a juvenile work program, which would give teens the chance to work at different village departments, earn money and have a mentor, Couzzo said.<ep>
   The village's juvenile programs are part of the village's attempt to bring police officers closer to the community.<ep>
   The village expects to get the money in July, but the new programs won't begin until the new Police Department opens late this year.<ep>
<m0>Helping the police station<ep>
<m0>   In fact, some of the money will be used to complete the new police station, which was approved in February.<ep>
   The building, at 9990 NE Second Ave., is expected to be finished late December or early January. By 1997, the department hopes to have some of its juvenile programs in place. <ep>
   ``Through these types of programs, hopefully we will be able to provide positive alternatives, instead of them getting involved in illegal activity,'' Couzzo said. ``It takes the whole community to raise one child.''<ep>
