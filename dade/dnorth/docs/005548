<m0>   Other diners at the Bayside Los Ranchos restaurant may have thought that the young women at the rear table were students celebrating their graduation.<ep>
   And they were partly right. The 13 teenagers are indeed in high school or college, and some of them have graduated with honors. But Thursday's party celebrated something more important (--) the fact that they were mothers.<ep>
   Their efforts to get ahead by working and studying while taking care of their children were rewarded Thursday night with a diploma from the Project for Single Teenage Mothers. The project (--) called Pasos, the Spanish word for ``steps'' (--) was created by ASPIRA, an organization whose goal is to strengthen Hispanic communities nationwide through education and leadership development.<ep>
   Carla Diaz, who is about to fulfill the dream she had when she arrived from El Salvador 10 years ago, said that studying at Miami-Dade Community College would not have been possible without the counsel provided by Pasos' coordinator, Marjorie Zurbaran.<ep>
   ``Sometimes I was tempted to give up, because I'm constantly exhausted,'' said Diaz, who will graduate next year with a major in business administration and export-import trade.<ep>
   Getting her degree has meant getting barely five hours of sleep a night, so she can work full time as a telephone operator and care for her children, 1 and 2 years old.<ep>
   Pasos students get information, education and assistance, to develop their personal and educational goals.<ep>
   They can also get financial aid to cover rent, utilities and transportation.<ep>
   A fund-raising campaign has just been launched, which is expected to collect at least $5,000 for scholarships. So far, aid for the 30 or so students who participate in Pasos has come from state funds and The United Way.<ep>
   The scholarships will bear the name of Nidia Castro, a former Pasos student. She died Dec. 20, 1995, in the crash of American Airlines Flight 965, north of Cali, Colombia.<ql>
