   Parents will learn this month if their children will be required to attend summer school, a new mandate to stiffen academic standards in elementary and middle schools.<P>

   But even kids who aren't failing will be affected by the requirement: The number of students ordered to attend will determine how many other seats are left for children who traditionally go to summer school to get ahead or have a place to stay while their parents work.<P>

   Elementary and middle schools are identifying the students who will be required to attend summer school because they are failing or have low test scores. Once those students are admitted, the spaces left over will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis.<P>

   Parents are urged to apply now for summer school and make alternative plans in case their children don't get admitted. Based on last year's admissions, however, most families have a good chance of getting in.<P>

   ``Last year, we were able to deal with all the kids who wanted to go,'' said Eduardo Rivas, the district's summer school supervisor. ``We think we'll be able to meet the needs again this year, but that's not a total guarantee for every single person.''<P>

   Elementary and middle school students can sign up for summer school now through June 19. They can register at their school.<P>

   Parents should call their child's school to find out if it's open for the summer or where the closest summer program will be offered.<P>

   Most schools plan to send notices home with students telling parents if their child has been admitted to summer school.<P>

    Students in English as a Second Language, alternative education and special education programs as well as new kindergartners also will get priority for summer school.<P>

  High school students don't have to worry about getting a seat in summer school. There is no limit on the number of spaces and students can attend even if they aren't behind in their studies. High school students can register at their schools from Monday until July 2, the first day of summer school for high school students. Elementary and middle summer schools start July 8.<P>

   Struggling elementary school students told to attend remedial classes this summer do have an option of taking the catch-up reading and math courses in after-school programs next school year. Fifth-graders who are behind, however, will be required to attend summer school if they want to advance to sixth grade.<P>

   The new requirement is part of an overhaul in standards and an attempt to show the state that Dade is taking summer school seriously. In the past, Dade and Broward have been criticized for overspending by opening summer school to all students, not just those who fail.<P>

   For parents who are unsure if their children will get into summer school in the elementary and middle schools, Dade is offering more summer camps than ever. Eleven public elementary schools already have announced they will open camps, which will offer some academics, as well as art, music, athletics and many field trips. The camps do not offer courses for credit.<P>

   More elementary schools are expected to announce camps within the new few weeks. Some middle schools also plan to offer camps for a fee. <P>

   The YWCA, YMCA and Family Christian Association of America will sponsor some of the camps, with prices ranging from $60 to $85 a week.<P>

   To find out if a school is planning a camp, call the school or inquire with the school system at 995-2500 between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays.
