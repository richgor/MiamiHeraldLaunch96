   Sheila Firestone's classes have a flair for music and the theater.<P>

   It's a grand combination, one she believes helps them learn to create.<P>

   Her students at Highland Oaks Elementary, 20500 NE 24th Ave., compose lyrics, melodies and rhythms based on stories they read in class or that they research. <P>

   They write operas -- libretto and all.<P>

   Firestone's creative approach to teaching landed her an Educator of Note award from the Young Patronesses of the Opera, a nonprofit group that recognizes young artists through scholarships and supports Florida's Grand Opera.<P>

   ``I integrate music because that makes children become more involved in the process when there is a reason to write and speak,'' said Firestone, who has been teaching at the school for the past 23 years. ``Music acts as a vehicle for expression.''<P>

   Firestone is the third teacher to receive the award from the organization, which is celebrating its 40th year this week. The Educator of Note award, which the group began giving out three years ago, comes with a $2,000 check and a Waterford crystal apple.    ``She worked so closely with her students to bring them into the opera world,'' said Louise Todaro, a member of the selection committee. ``She's in essence a teacher of the gifted. She's not a music teacher.''<P>

   Out of seven finalists, Todaro said the patronesses chose Firestone in part for what her students have achieved.<P>

   In 1994, her class won first place for a music video from the Jim Harbin Florida Association for Media Education. The piece, called Endangered Animal's Alphabet Theme Song, was part of a larger show called the Endangered Crusader's Campaign about animals being increasingly endangered by human carelessness. That production also received an award from the Sierra Club. <P>

   Her students come up with original melodies and rhythms. Their current project, The Opera Lady, is based on the life of Roberta Rymer Balfe, a supporter of locally based opera education.
