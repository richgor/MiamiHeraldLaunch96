   Another school may be in the works for the Miami Shores area (--) a welcome addition to parents critical of the public schools.<ep>
   The bill for charter schools has made its way through Tallahassee and is awaiting Gov. Lawton Chiles' signature. Meanwhile, advocates of the schools are taking their place in line to get one of the seven up for grabs in Dade County. <ep>
   Barry University, which already works closely with the area's elementary school, will likely apply for one of the slots. Other likely applicants include the Urban League's T. Willard Fair and real estate developer Jeb Bush.<ep>
   ``Indeed, Barry is thinking about it, but right now there is nothing that is ready,'' said Michele Morris, the director of University Relations. ``It is too soon to be talking about it.''<ep>
   After two years of battling, the Legislature passed the bill that will give counties with large populations, like Dade and Broward, at least seven charter schools each.<ep>
   A charter school, which goes from kindergarten to 12th grade, is run like a private school, but with public funds. It is designed to give creative educators who want to open and operate a school outside of the public system a means to do it with public money. <ep>
   Though not speculating on their proposal, Barry administrators said if they did land a charter contract they would want the elementary to be close to the private university. Barry sits within the borders of Miami Shores.<ep>
   Geographically, Shores residents currently have a few for their children, including elementary schools, middle and high school.<ep>
   Village Mayor Lou Imburgia, however, said that one more choice for parents could ease the overcrowding of local schools. <ep>
   ``There is room for three more schools here,'' he said. ``St. Rosa of Lima the other day had 100 kids apply for kindergarten and there was room for 10. There is a great need in the northeast, no question about it.''<ql>
