<m0>   For years the misuse of the term ``Creole'' has annoyed me. <m1> <m0>Your paper and other entities in Dade County use this term to refer to the bastardized French Haitians speak.<ep>
   This is an incorrect usage. <m1> <m0>The term ``Creole'' refers to the descendants of European settlers and former African slaves, normally in the Caribbean and parts of South America. <m1> <m0>This grouping distinguished them from aboriginal inhabitants. Therefore, what is spoken by Haitians is a Creole dialect (--) not a language.<ep>
   This is also the case of Cajun, spoken by the Arcadians in Louisiana. <m1> <m0>It is not solely limited to former French colonies; the local dialect of Aruba, a mixture of Dutch, Spanish and French, is also a Creole. <m1> <m0>Please stop the misusage.<ep>
   Moreover, the cover story of [Sunday April 28] Neighbors deals with the enormous numbers of fires in Little Haiti. <m1> <m0>The article plays up the fact that only one firefighter on one shift speaks Haitian [Creole].<ep>
   What's the problem? These people need to learn how to speak English. Immigrants must learn to leave their old ways in the old country. <m1> <m0>Your paper does a disservice by printing an article in Haitian [Creole] every Sunday. <m1> <m0>It is insulting to those of us who have lived the immigrant experience, learned the language and assimilated. Why don't you print a Yiddish section, given the large Jewish population in Northeast Dade?<ep>
