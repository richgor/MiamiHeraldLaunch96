<m0>   When Cherner Orelhomme first entered John F. Kennedy Middle School, he knew there was a mistake in his schedule as soon as he walked into <m0>that <m0>band class.<ep>
   Because of that mistake, though, Cherner has been performing before audiences as far away as Atlanta over the past three years, and he's hoping to play the saxophone all the way through college.<ep>
   ``The best part, I think, is knowing that you achieved something and making new friends,'' Cherner said. ``When I grow up, I can look back and see we were in the best band.''<ep>
   Cherner is just one of the success stories of the North Miami Beach school's jazz band, some say the best middle school jazz band in the county. The band recently was invited to play at Six Flags Over Georgia and at Moorhouse College, both in Atlanta.<ep>
   ``It's a good thing the kids are visiting other places,'' said Christopher Dorsey, the band's director. ``We want to let people know about all the positive things that are going on down here.''<ep>
   Before going to Atlanta in April, the band played at Costco Supermarket, Metrozoo, the Dade County Teacher of the Year luncheon, the Dade County Youth Fair, elementary schools, retirement homes, churches and even the Magic Kingdom in Orlando.<ep>
   ``Talent is breeding here. That what's happening at JFK,'' said Dorsey, a finalist for Region II teacher of the year this year. ``Kids are practicing from the first day of school all the way through June.''<ep>
   The band practices after school, on Saturdays and plays at Dorsey's church on Sundays. Such dedication has paid off, said Frandy Vertas, 15, who has devoted himself to the trumpet for the past three years.<ep>
  ``We practice to be the best,'' he said.<ep>
   Earlier this year, the students received the school system's highest honor, placing it among the seven best bands in Dade. <ep>
   ``Getting superiors at the evaluation was the climax of the year,'' said Alan Chambers, 14, who plays alto saxophone. ``The Atlanta trip is pretty much the icing on the cake.''<ep>
   The band does a lot more than teach students to play an instrument, Dorsey said.<ep>
   ``Band gives a kid self-worth, self reliance, teaches them discipline,'' he said. ``It teaches them that things don't just happen, it takes hard work. It takes kids who are shy out of their shells, helps them learn to express themselves.''<ep>
   Principal Valerie Carrier has noticed changes in the students who are part of the band.<ep>
   ``To be a successful band player you have to practice. That commitment structure comes through in all other classes,'' she said.<ep>
   Dorsey said the band also has become <m1> <m0>a ``safe haven'' for some students, keeping them out of trouble.<ep>
   Said Cherner, who hopes to get a scholarship to college: <ep>
 ``Without the after-school practices I would probably be with my friends, doing things I wasn't supposed do, like getting into fights and stealing.''<ql>
