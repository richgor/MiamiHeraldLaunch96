   Aventura Mayor Arthur Snyder this week called on 10 residents to put their heads together and help him come up with fresh ideas and solutions to problems that will eventually visit Dade's newest city.<ep>
   The Mayor's Advisory Committee is made up of longtime activists such as Leonard Brenner and George Berlin, as well as a few lawyers, a developer and a doctor. <ep>
   ``These are 10 people that I know and I consider extremely bright,'' Snyder said. ``Their job is to think in long terms and to see where they think the city is going.''<ep>
   Snyder said ``most presidents have had an advisory committee'' to help them come up with solutions to problems, and that a similar group might work well for a mayor.<ep>
   Municipalities have boards and committees to guide and advise their elected officials, but this committee will differ by reporting directly to the mayor. <m1>    <m0>Brenner, a longtime advocate for Aventura's incorporation, is the president of the Joint Council of Aventura, which groups representatives of businesses and condominiums in the area. Through the organizations, he will pass on to Snyder ideas and issues that affect the city's diverse constituency.<ep>
   ``We will help him think up ideas for the city and get the citizens involved in the day-to-day operation,'' Brenner said.<ep>
   The committee is chaired by Bob Diamond, a lawyer and a former mayor of a community in New Jersey. The group is expected to meet for the first time this week. Since they are serving as an adviser to the mayor and not the council, the committee meetings will not be held in public.<ql>
