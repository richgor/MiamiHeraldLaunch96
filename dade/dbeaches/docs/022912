<m1><ep>
<m0>   It's getting close to 10 a.m. on a Saturday in May, and a boy named Robert Paul Diaz eagerly watches the clock in the lobby of the Humane Society of Greater Miami.<ep>
   Robert Paul is turning 10 years old the next day, and he has come to the North Dade animal shelter with his sister, mom and grandmother to find a puppy.<ep>
   Nearby sits Mark Smith, who hopes to take a cat home to his apartment near downtown Miami.<ep>
   Finally, they are allowed to go in.<ep>
      The five wind their way through a hallway lined with wooden fence boards, which opens onto a long room with a tile floor (--) easily mopped.<ep>
   On the right are a row of doors and windows of about a half-dozen canine ``apartments,'' each home to two or three dogs.<ep>
   Here lives Alfa, a 2-year-old cocker spaniel mix left at the shelter two weeks ago by a grown man with tears in his eyes. The man's neighbors had been complaining about Alfa, and at last he was giving in and entrusting his little friend to strangers.<ep>
   In his first days in the shelter, Alfa was inconsolable. He couldn't be coaxed out of his apartment. Today, though, he's wagging his tail happily as the newcomers enter.<ep>
      The Diaz family pauses to look through the apartment windows, then moves on to the next room, where about a dozen puppies pad about in individual kennels.<ep>
   Almost immediately, Robert Paul, a fourth-grader at Hialeah Elementary, focuses on two who are at least partly golden retriever. Soon, he's cradling one in his arms and declaring it his own.<ep>
   ``Don't you think we should go to the other place, too?'' asks his mother, Lucy Diaz.<ep>
   He shakes his head no. Then a staffer tells them his dog is male (--) a no-no to Mom, who thinks it'll be too aggressive. Luckily, the other pup is a girl.<ep>
   ``OK, OK,'' Robert Paul says, quickly putting the first dog back and rushing over to the second one.<ep>
      Beyond the puppy area is the cats' room, which is overbooked today, with some kittens two or three to a cage, snuggled together in slumber or boxing each other softly.<ep>
   Mark Smith carefully considers each one, cage by cage, from the oversized black adult to the pair of gray and white kittens.<ep>
   Pausing for a moment, Smith pulls a leash and collar from his pocket and sighs. ``I was all ready for a dog, but the apartment building said no,'' he says.<ep>
   So he settles on the big black cat. Well, actually, that's not quite how it happens.<ep>
   ``That cat picked me,'' Smith says. ``That cat stuck its paw out as I walked by, and I wasn't even looking at it. The moment we had . . .''<ep>
   He won't name his new pet; it'll just have to answer to ``cat,'' he says. ``I didn't birth that cat, so I don't get to name it.''<ep>
<m0>Sterilizing a must<ep>
<m0>   More and more people are arriving to look at the pets, and staffer Grace Carr (--) one of about 40 paid workers at this shelter and a smaller one in Cutler Ridge (--) is rushing among the three areas.<ep>
   Carr helps one couple apply for an adoption, photocopying their photo IDs and finding out what kind of home the pet would have.<ep>
   Then she scoops up a black puppy and tells a family they can pick up their new pet in the afternoon, after it's been sterilized.<ep>
   No animal goes home without the surgery; population control is a major goal of the clinic. A flier on the wall notes that a pair of breeding cats could produce a tribe of 80 million in just a decade if none were spayed or neutered.<ep>
      Back at the front counter, Pat Camas of Kendall is trying to take care of the paperwork for her new dog, a female somehow bestowed with the name Peter.<ep>
   The shelter charges $50 (no checks, please) for sterilization, shots and an identifying tattoo, and it also collects the county's $24 dog license fee.<ep>
   Camas' check-out is a little more complicated than usual because Peter's information sheet has been chewed into about two dozen pieces.<ep>
   ``OK, we know it's a dog,'' Camas says.<ep>
<m0>`I'll be back to get you'<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   A little later, Patricia Brownlee picks out a fluorescent-green nylon collar and leash from the lobby display of pet supplies.<ep>
   She and husband Eugene are waiting for a staffer to bring out their new dog (--) Alfa, the cocker spaniel mix.<ep>
   She'd been to the shelter before, and when she had spotted the calm and friendly Alfa in his three-dog apartment, she made him a promise.<ep>
   ``The other two dogs were loud and noisy, and I said, `Dog, this ain't your thing. I'll be back to get you tomorrow.' ''<ep>
      Besides the lobby, there's another way into the shelter, around back, where people turn in the animals they don't want or can't keep.<ep>
   In the average month, the shelters here and in Cuter Ridge take in about 800 dogs and cats, plus the occasional rabbit or hamster.<ep>
<m0>The dropping-off point<ep>
<m0>   At the counter is Martha Carballea, who has come from her home near Greynolds Park to drop off a healthy-looking puppy.<ep>
   The mother dog had been a stray Carballea had taken in not long ago. She turned out to be pregnant and had a litter of 10, but after setting up a table outside a local Publix, Carballea had found homes for all but this one.<ep>
   Puppies like this one are usually adopted quickly, the young man behind the counter assures her.<ep>
      Kenny Tatum approaches next, setting a gray plastic animal carrier on the counter. Inside several 8-week-old kittens are curled together. How many?<ep>
   ``I don't know, maybe about five,'' answers Tatum, who lives near Miami International Airport. ``We've got a bunch of momma cats running around, and I'm just trying to give some of them to other people.''<ep>
   The shelter worker suggests he have the animal spayed so he doesn't have to come back in several months.<ep>
   Tatum shrugs. ``If we catch them,'' he says. ``Most of them are wild anyway.''<ep>
   The shelter worker asks how much he's going to donate, and Tatum pulls out a folded check, already made out for $30.<ep>
   Tatum is followed by Llamile Diamond of Miami, who has a huge shepherd mix called Blackie on a leash. Diamond had taken the dog home the day before, but now she's decided she wants to trade her in for a different pet.<ep>
   ``They told us she was an inside/outside dog, but she only wanted to be inside,'' Diamond says. ``She didn't even want to eat or anything. She didn't even bark.''<ep>
   The shelter takes Blackie back, but she is told she can't have another dog until her home is inspected.<ep>
<m0>Because they love animals<ep>
<m0>   <ep>
   Beyond the receiving-area counter are the animals that are waiting for a doctor's check.<ep>
   About a quarter of them will find new homes. A few will go to Broward's shelter, but most of the rest will be put to sleep, the likely fate of a gray-spotted puppy (--) a terrier, perhaps (--) whimpering and shivering in one of the holding pens.<ep>
   The anxious animal is longing for an affectionate rub, even just one tender touch, but Scott Jelescheff, the center's volunteer coordinator, knows better.<ep>
   The puppy has mange, a parasitic skin disease that can spread easily to people and other animals, and the shelter must remain vigilant to prevent epidemics.<ep>
   ``It's not fair to take all our resources and pour them into one animal when we've got eight more healthy ones over here. How nice a dog it is doesn't matter,'' Jelescheff says.<ep>
   ``It's kind of a Catch-22. If we turned him into the street, he'd probably die a much worse death than to be put to death humanely. The people here kill animals because they love them.'' <m2><ql>
<m0>At the clinic<ep>
<m0>      Across the parking lot sits the Humane Society's well-animal clinic, which offers low-cost shots and sterilization to the public.<ep>
   Carolina Yaya and Edison Montes have brought their cocker spaniel Pumpkin all the way from Kendall on the advice of Yaya's mother.<ep>
   Part-time veterinarian Jeff Bayard gives Pumpkin a shot, then asks the couple if they've started the dog on a monthly anti-worm pill yet.<ep>
   ``No . . .'' Yaya answers slowly.<ep>
   Bayard pulls out a plastic model of an infected animal heart and explains how common the problem is in South Florida's warm weather. Worms can grow to more than a foot long, causing fatal problems like heart failure.<ep>
   ``Muy importante,'' says a nodding Yaya.<ep>
   ``Muy, muy importante,'' Bayard agrees.<ep>
<m0>Their final home<ep>
<m0>      Behind the clinic, a large lawn is littered with marble and stone markers.<ep>
   A painted wooden sign labels the area the Oaklawn Pet Cemetery, home for half a century to hundreds of dearly departed dogs, cats, birds (--) even horses and a few people, including local Humane Society founder Charles William Pusey.<ep>
   At the center, a life-size statue of a Great Dane stands sentinel. A stone at the base of the dog reads, ``Polar Prince 1934-1949 Hyland.''<ep>
   Silk flowers and ceramic figurines decorate many of the plots.<ep>
   At one grave, red satin poinsettias and a gold figurine of a Great Dane form a shrine to the beloved Sonia. ``Aun asi te sigo queriendo mi fiel amiga,'' the plaque says. ``Even now I love you, my faithful friend.''<ep>
      Around the edge of the cemetery, a small, black lab walks with a woman who goes only by Nynda (--) she never uses her last name because she's going to be a rock star one day.<ep>
   Nynda comes by every Saturday to give the shelter dogs some exercise, and she loves reading the grave markers as she strolls through.<ep>
   Her favorite, to a trio of pets who died in the 1970s, reads, ``Each its own master, dominated by none. Love, devotion, companionship in life and for eternity.''<ep>
   The first time she saw it, it gave her chills, she says.<ep>
   ``It's funny,'' she says. ``Some people love animals so much, and others just don't care.''<ep>
