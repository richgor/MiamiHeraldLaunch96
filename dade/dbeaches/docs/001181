   Last week, the Villa Deli almost went the way of its erstwhile clientele.<ep>
   Tuesday, the deli appeared to die quietly and peacefully, an old relic among hip new neighbors that had moved in along Lincoln Road.<ep>
   A sign on the front door said the deli closed for ``economic reasons,'' but promised to re-open soon. Inside, the flickering neon sign advertising Hebrew National hotdogs glowed in the dark. Half-empty bottles of ketchup stood like lone sentinels, placed in the center of every table, awaiting the return of customers.<ep>
   Although owners Stephen and Larry Schatzman tried to keep pace with the changes around South Beach, Villa Deli, 1608 Alton Rd., just wasn't attracting customers like it used to.<ep>
   ``All of my customers died or moved away,'' he said. ``The elderly Jewish population is gone completely.''<ep>
   Also, competition among restaurants has grown stiffer. More than 200 restaurants in the South Beach area offer an array of food 24 hours a day, with more than 20 lining Lincoln Road alone.<ep>
   ``When we bought the restaurant, there were maybe 15 restaurants open on the Beach,'' Schatzman said. ``Now it's difficult to get what's left of the business because it's so diluted by the number of restaurants that are there.''<ep>
   Former owner Phil Greenbaum disagreed. Greenbaum owned the deli for eight years and sold it to the Schatzmans in 1990.<ep>
   ``Obviously all the franchise operators who came to Miami Beach must think otherwise,'' he said. ``The location is prime. It was before all these new restaurants opened up, and it still is.'' <ep>
   When Greenbaum heard about the deli's demise, he stepped in to breathe new life into the business.<ep>
   ``I know what was here before and I'm going to try to reproduce it,'' he said. ``I'm coming back in to try to re-establish it as it was. It had always been rated one of (--) if not the best (--) delies in Miami. I hope to be able to reproduce that.''<ep>
   The deli is scheduled to re-open at 6 a.m. Monday with just a few changes. The hours have been scaled back (--) dinner will no longer be served. But the prices will be a bit less, Greenbaum promises.<ep>
   To celebrate the deli's rebirth, Villa Deli's famous breakfast special will be re-instated. For $1.29 plus tax, early risers get two eggs with a choice of potatoes or grits, a bagel or toast, cream cheese or butter, and coffee or tea.<ep>
   ``We'll see how long we can hold out at that price without losing money,'' Greenbaum said.<ql>
