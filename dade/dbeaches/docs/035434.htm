Manny Hagen is pouring half a million dollars into his hotel, a sign of the buoying confidence in North Beach.<BR>

   Manny Hagen remembers better days at his hotel.<P>

   He remembers men in suits as crisp as fresh money streaming in with their young families and lines that stretched to the street for a room. He remembers visitors from Chicago, New York and Canada cramming the lobby and passing the time on the oversized porch with cards or Chinese mah jong.<P>

   It was the 1950s. His parents, aunt and uncle were running the Ocean Surf Hotel in North Beach and times were good.<P>

   But times have changed and Hagen has since witnessed economic droughts at the 49-room hotel at 7436 Ocean Ter., including fewer visitors and seasons full of empty rooms.<P>

   To bring back the glory days Hagen -- now the hotel's owner -- is pouring half a million dollars into the Ocean Surf, a signal of the buoying confidence stirring in North Beach.<P>

   ``It's a big undertaking,'' said Hagen, 60, referring to the renovation that will give the hotel new plumbing, bathrooms and air conditioning while preserving its classic Art Deco architecture.<P>

   ``If we would like for this to be another tourist area like it was when I was a kid growing up, we have to do this,'' he said.<P>

    Built in the late 1940s as the Alcan Surf Hotel, the Ocean Surf was bought by the Hagen family in 1951 and has been family-owned and operated ever since.<P>

   The Ramada Deauville Hotel, 6701 Collins Ave., is also making facade and ballroom renovations costing nearly $1 million. Eckerd Drugs at 7400 Collins Ave. is expanding, and a Blockbuster Video store is moving into 65th Street.<P>

   Why all the activity?<P>

   North Beach property owners are encouraged by the $34 million in improvement projects being managed by the North Beach Development Corp.<P>

   A $20 million streetscape project under way will improve drainage and lighting and beautify medians throughout the area.<P>

   Sidewalks at Ocean Terrace will be 10 feet wider than the sidewalks on Ocean Drive, hopefully paving the way for sidewalk cafes along the three-block oceanfront stretch between 73rd and 75th streets.<P>

   ``The rest of the city is very quickly going to recognize the fact that North Beach is a very special place,'' said Ronnie Singer, executive director of the North Beach Development Corp. ``The next few years are going to be tremendous in terms of growth and in terms of desirability. And Ocean Terrace is going to be a major destination spot.''<P>

   Renovations to the Ocean Surf, to begin in June, will close it down for four to six months, said Brian Kraus, Hagen's son-in-law and director of operations. The improvements will also widen doorways and install entrance ramps to accommodate disabled visitors, he said.<P>

   The improvements were needed and long-coming, Kraus said.<P>

   ``We weren't going to do anything until the city did,'' Kraus said. ``Now we see a big future here. A lot of things are happening in this area.''
