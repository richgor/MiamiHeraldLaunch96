<m0>   Letter carriers will work toward a special delivery on their appointed rounds Saturday.<ep>
   The National Association of Letter Carriers, Tropical Branch 1071, will conduct its annual food drive to benefit the Daily Bread Food Bank. South Florida homeowners and businesses are encouraged to leave donations of nonperishable food at their mailbox locations for carriers to collect as they deliver the mail.<ep>
    Last year, more than 40 million pounds of food was collected nationally through the annual drive. The Food Bank distributed nearly 800,000 pounds of food that was collected in South Florida to more than 1,200 charitable organization in Dade, Broward, Monroe and Palm Beach counties.<ql>
