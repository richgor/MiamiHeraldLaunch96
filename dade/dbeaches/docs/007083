   Arriving in caravans of buses, vans and cars, 700 teenagers converged on Tropical Park Wednesday for a chance at history.<ep>
   They lined up at portable toilets to establish a Guinness book world record for the largest number of teenagers to take drug tests at one time. And they had their community (--) and President Clinton (--) behind them.<ep>
   During his Monday visit to Miami, Clinton hailed the members of the Drug-Free Youth in Town (--) D-FY-IT for short (--) for helping kids stay away from drugs. Two days later, at the group's outdoor Drug Test Fest at Tropical Park, more adults (--) from FBI agent Ken Ivy to Miami Heat Vice President Wali Jones (--) praised them for creating a fun group that shows kids there is an alternative to the drug culture. D-FY-IT is now the largest public school organization in the county.<ep>
   ``This is definitely positive,'' Ivy said as the students cheered. ``I like it.''<ep>
   Some of the teenagers said they have already seen their brothers and sisters and friends become addicted and drop out of school. Others said their neighborhoods are infested with dealers who try to pass off drugs as hip. They all said they don't mind giving a urine sample to prove they are drug-free.<ep>
   ``We're here to take the test and show that drugs are not cool,'' said Homestead Middle student Nathalie Target, 13. ``They just ruin lives. There's a lot of pressure out there. I live in the projects and there's a lot of people taking drugs.''<ep>
   Gulliver Prep junior Kelly Gaudet, vice president of her school's D-FY-IT, said students need to know they can have fun without having to take drugs.<ep>
   ``I think this is the best way to keep kids out of trouble,'' she said.<ep>
   D-FY-IT already has 2,500 members from around the county, and nearly every private and public school in Dade is asking for a chapter, said two of the group's founders, Elaine Beame and Marlene Josefsberg.<ep>
   They're hoping to expand the club by applying for federal grant money that will become more available with Clinton's new concerted anti-drug campaign.<ep>
   ``Let's not give up on kids,'' added Bruce Hayden, another founder. ``We write off so many people and we shouldn't. We need to help kids resist the influence of the drug culture.''<ql>
