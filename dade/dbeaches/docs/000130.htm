   Glam Slam -- the South Beach dance emporium owned by The Artist Formerly Known As Prince -- is set to reopen three months after a drug raid shut it down.<P>

   Its new manager will be Yves Di Lena, who owns two other popular South Beach clubs: Les Bains, 753 Washington Ave., and the Warsaw Ballroom, 1450 Collins Ave.<P>

   Glam Slam, 1235 Washington Ave., will still be owned by Paisley Park, the Artist's company, when it opens its doors May 18th.<P>

   ``The changes there are going to be exciting,'' said Maxwell Blandford, a club spokesman. ``We're working that out right now.''<P>

   Glam Slam closed in January after Miami Beach Police officers, some donning ski masks and rubber gloves, swarmed into the club and booted out the nearly 2,000 party-goers, yanking the club's liquor license on the way out.<P>

   The raid was part of a series of drug raids police conducted with the Florida Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco after local television stations detailed illicit sex and drug buying in South Beach clubs.<P>

   Nine drug buys transpired at Glam Slam in a 16-day undercover sting, according to Miami Beach police. Fourteen other clubs around South Beach were hit. Two others, Groove Jet and Twist, were also closed down and have since reopened. The stings showed drugs such as LSD, cocaine and Special K circulating through the clubs.<P>

   Blandford said Di Lena and his management team spent the first week on the job trying to regain the club's liquor license, though he wouldn't give specifics on how exactly that was accomplished.<P>

   Though he would not give any details, he said security will be tight to avoid a reoccurrence of January's raids.<P>

   ``We've instituted tight security at Warsaw,'' Blandford said, ``and we're going to institute the same at Glam Slam.''<P>

   The new Glam Slam will feature a stronger concert venue, mixing a wide variety of live acts, from trendy to rock to R&B, Blandford said. The new venue, he suggested, could pull in acts that usually play at Fort Lauderdale's The Edge.<P>

   ``There's not really a concert venue on South Beach,'' Blandford said. ``Hopefully we could upgrade the entertainment showcase for talent here.''
