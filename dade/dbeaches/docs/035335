   Just fake it.<ep>
   That's what Metro-Dade police say the owner of a Doral wholesale manufacturing company was trying to do. They arrested him May 2 for allegedly making and selling knock-off top name T-shirts (--) including Nike and Tommy Hilfiger.<ep>
   Police confiscated $10,000 worth of the shirts in a scenario that has become more and more familiar.<ep>
   Police say Jorge Murcia, 37, of Embroidery USA, 7064 NW 50th St., used stolen computer disks programmed with the brands' logos to sew the designs on T-shirts and jerseys of lesser quality.<ep>
   The list of the company's fake shirts reads like a who's who of brand names (--) Polo, Guess!, Hard Rock Cafe. The company was even making ``Olympics '96'' T-shirts, police say.<ep>
   The fakes look like the real thing to a consumer, but investigators from A Action Investigators and Security, a private company that regularly checks out local shirt manufacturers for big-name trademark clients, found torn off original tags and average-quality fabric, police said.<ep>
   ``You pay top dollar for these things and don't get what you pay for,'' said Lt. Mickey Brelsford, of Metro-Dade's Doral District station. ``In some cases you can see where the tag's been sewn on top of the original one.''<ep>
   Counterfeiting costs U.S. manufacturers $2 billion a year, he said.<ep>
   Murcia has been charged with two felonies: forging or counterfeiting private labels and vending goods with counterfeiting labels.<ep>
   Police said Embroidery USA is still open for business, as long as it is the legal kind.<ql>
