<m0>   The Performing Arts Institute, a nonprofit educational organization which performed last summer at the New Theater in Coral Gables in collaboration with the University of Miami School of Music Musical Theater Program, will have auditions for their summer program for gifted high school students.<ep>
     The program will include three weeks of intensive musical theater training for students age 13 through 18. Auditions will be at 4 p.m. today and May 19 in Broby Hall on the UM's Coral Gables campus. Students will be taken in order of arrival and should bring two contrasting songs and one monologue.<ep>
    During the summer program, which will run from July 8 through July 28, nine music and theater professionals will cover all aspects of performance culminating with a fully staged performance July 28. <ep>
     Cost for the program is $650 with some partial scholarship assistance available based on talent and financial need. Enrollment will be limited. <ep>
