<m0>   Next week, 17 community members will begin meeting with Metro-Dade County Manager Armando Vidal to decide how and where $3.5 million should be spent to help resettle Cuban and Haitian immigrants who came through the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay.<ep>
   People from all corners of Dade County have been selected to serve on the Immigration Emergency Fund Advisory Committee. Vidal will chair the committee.<ep>
   The first meeting is Wednesday, when Lt. Gov. Buddy McKay is expected to attend, said Virginia Sanchez, director of Metro-Dade County's Governmental Affairs. <m1><ep>
<m0>   The committee's task will be to recommend to Gov. Lawton Chiles how to spend the money and whether it should go to agencies that already help immigrants. <ep>
   ``The manager wanted various members of Dade County represented in the committee so that all groups have a voice,'' said Dean Taylor, an assistant county manager.<ep>
