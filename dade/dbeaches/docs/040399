<m0>   You'll forget you're in Dade County as you set up camp in this secluded 618-acre spot on the edge of the Everglades. Launch your canoe in one of three freshwater lakes to catch bass and look for lolling gators. You can also fish and hike the canal that runs along Northwest 177th Avenue.<ep>
   Dade County corrections officer Hugo Montessi, his wife Emilia, son Gino, 9, and daughter Ana Emilia, four months, use the campground as a stopover between their Naples home and Hugo's Miami workplace.<ep>
   ``We start the morning with a good breakfast outdoors. Then we just hang around or ride bikes,'' Hugo Montessi said. ``At night, you can hear all kinds of sounds from the wild (--) that's music. The baby sleeps better here than she does at home.''<ql>

<m0>   For a true wilderness experience, do Cape Sable the way Tom Wilson of Miami Shores and his party of 10 did it: rent a canoe for $30 at Flamingo, paddle ten miles across Florida Bay, set up camp, build a fire and hang out on a vast, pristine, sugarlike beach.<ep>
   ``I'd like to have had a two-horsepower outboard,'' Wilson said afterward. ``Paddling for four hours can be tedious.''<ep>
   You don't have to paddle the open bay if you have your own boat. The trip takes about 30 minutes by powerboat.<ep>
    Wilson's fiancee, Susan Townsend of Nashville, Tenn., said the long trek to Cape Sable was worth the effort. ``I have never seen so many stars,'' Townsend said. <m1> <m0>``You could see the glow from Marathon and Key West.''<ep>
   Jan Klingner of Miami Shores enjoyed watching dolphins breaking the surface around her canoe and flocks of birds passing overhead: brown and white pelicans, ibis, egrets, herons, cormorants and ospreys.<ep>
   Son John, 6, also had fun on the trip. ``I caught a catfish on the way back,'' John Klingner said. <m1> <m0>``I used turkey pastrami.''<ep>
   You also can paddle the Bear Lake canoe trail, but check with a park ranger first. The trail turns to quick mud in dry weather. U.S. Army captain Bruce Statler of Miami found out the hard way.<ep>
   ``It got so bad we had to get out in black quicksand-like stuff and push ourselves out of there,'' Statler said. ``Some Albanian fishermen in a motorboat towed both our canoes back to Flamingo.''<ep>

<m0>   A free back country permit is required from Flamingo Visitor Center up to 24 hours before the trip. The visitor center is open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call (941) 695-2945. Park entry fee is $7.<ep>
   Facilities: None. Cape Sable is reachable only by canoe, kayak or shallow-draft powerboat. You must take one gallon per person per day of fresh water, food, compass, nautical charts, sunscreen, insect repellent, rain gear, sunglasses, tent (with netting), bedding and flashlight. You must pack out all trash.<ep>

<m0>   This 243-acre park next to Metrozoo features a 35-acre freshwater lake with a water slide, concession stand, white sand beach and paddleboats. It's open Memorial Day through Labor Day, but campers can fish the lake all year. Park manager Mike Dmytriw offers field trips to Everglades National Park, Weeks Air Museum, Fairchild Tropical Garden and other local attractions.<ep>
   The park's vegetation appears charred and stumpy in spots in the wake of Hurricane Andrew and recent brushfires. But birds abound, including swallowtail kites and hawks. Plenty of fruit trees (--) lychee nut, avocado and mango (--) dot the campground, but the fruit is off limits to campers.<ep>

<m0>   You will never run out of things to do at this sprawling, 427-acre park in Broward County. You can canoe, fish or go cable water skiing (no boat needed) in the lake. A children's water playground features ``Splash Adventure'' (--) a high-tech waterborne amusement park with slides, swings, waterfalls, rotating tunnels and funny mirrors.<ep>
   When you grow tired of being waterlogged, hit the 18-hole miniature golf course; rent single and tandem bicycles; play softball, volleyball, football, soccer or horseshoes.<ep>
   Robert Hysell and sons Dustin, 14; Joseph, 11, and Charles, 3, make the 100-mile drive to Quiet Waters from Okeechobee about once a month.<ep>

<m0>   The 665-acre park on the edge of the Everglades in Broward County provides the usual water amenities: a fishing lake with paddleboat, rowboat and canoe rentals, and a swimming pool with lockers and restrooms. But Markham offers some unexpected diversions: a personal watercraft recreation area; paved model airplane field; tennis/racquetball center; observatory for stargazing; and a world-class target range.<ep>
   Martha Ricardo of Miami, daughter Elizabeth, 11, and another family camped for eight days at Markham during the Easter holidays. <m1> <m0>Ricardo said the group occupied itself with simple pleasures: biking, volleyball, basketball and hiking the mile-long nature trail.<ep>
   The Ricardos said they were delighted by the wildlife that visited their campsite.<ep>
   ``We saw four owls on the nature trail,'' Martha reported. ``We were surrounded by squirrels, birds and raccoons. <m1> <m0>A raccoon ate all the bananas, coffee and punch we left on the table. We plan to come back.''<ql>

<m0>   This 150-acre urban park is located just west of I-95 (--) less than a 15-minute drive from Hollywood Beach and is adjacent to several shopping complexes. But there are lots of ways to amuse an active family without leaving the oak-shaded environs.<ep>
   Fish, canoe or paddleboat in a 40-acre lake. Slip down a waterslide into the swimming lagoon. Rent bicycles and sports equipment. The park shows occasional movies and hosts hayride/campfire nights.<ep>
   Elsie and Ronnie Stevens of Fort Lauderdale frequently camp at the park with son Kodie, 3, and daughter Courtney, 5.<ep>
   ``Bike riding, fishing and the beach are fun,'' Elsie Stevens said. ``The kids enjoy the playgrounds. <m1> <m0>It's great relaxation.''<ep>
