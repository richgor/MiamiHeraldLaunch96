   Miami Beach commissioners blasted a local architectural firm Wednesday for requesting an extra $24,000 in fees from the city.<ep>
   Bermello, Ajamil and Partners was hired by the city last year to create a master plan of park improvements in a contract worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Wednesday's request, placed on the agenda by the city manager's office, asked that the architects be paid an additional $24,000 for meetings and workshops they held for the public recently and for a tour it gave commissioners of city parks.<ep>
   The request was unanimously shot down by commissioners.<ep>
   ``This project is too big for them to be hitting us with these petty cash bills,'' Mayor Seymour Gelber said. ``It shows a lack of professionalism to me.''<ep>
   The architects were chosen to create a master plan that will outline use of $15 million in bond funds approved by voters in 1994 to improve Miami Beach's parks and greenspace.<ep>
   The contract required the firm to hold 18 or 20 public workshops, the architects said, which in turn spawned more meetings and workshops. The $24,000 bill was mostly for meetings the firm had to attend ``above and beyond the contract.''<ep>
   ``We feel these were additional meetings,'' said Rai A. Fernandez, an architect with the firm. ``Not only meetings but incorporating the public's comments and redrawing plans.''<ep>
   The tour the company gave commissioners earlier this year represented only a small portion of the costs, Fernandez said.<ep>
   ``In my opinion there must have been a misunderstanding,'' he said. ``We're in the process of clarifying that.''<ep>
   Commissioners said they were caught by surprise by the request.<ep>
   ``It came out of left field for all of us,'' Commissioner Susan Gottlieb said. ``That money should go into the parks program not into the designers who are doing the plan. This should not have been an extra charge.''<ep>
   Fernandez said his firm is currently justifying the request and hopes to hear from the city administration soon.<ep>
   Getting it past the commission, however, may be difficult.<ep>
   ``This is a tremendous project that we're undertaking with them,'' Mayor Gelber said. ``To find additional sources of revenue for themselves just didn't seem appropriate.''<ql>
