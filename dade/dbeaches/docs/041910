<m0>   Two hungry gunmen would have gotten away with the dough if one of them hadn't been clumsy.<ep>
   After the teens stole two large pizzas, two six-packs of Pepsi, a set of car keys and $50 from a delivery man at gunpoint, the gunman accidentally shot himself in the leg.<ep>
   The robbers held up Fernando Galindo, who was delivering pizzas to an apartment at 926 79th Ter. at 11:10 p.m. Tuesday. Police say one of them pointed a gun at Galindo and ordered him to ``give up the pizza.'' The other man then grabbed the two large pizzas and two six-packs of Pepsi from Galindo. <ep>
   When the gunman demanded money and the keys to the car, Galindo handed over $50 in cash.<ep>
   As the robbers ran away, the gunman dropped his gun. The .380 caliber handgun fired when it hit the pavement, shooting the gunman in the right leg.<ep>
   The teens ran home to an apartment building in the 700 block of 82nd Street, where the gunman's mother called 911.<ep>
   Police quickly identified the teens as those who robbed Galindo. The teens were charged with armed robbery and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony.<ep>
