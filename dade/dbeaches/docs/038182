   OK, mystery bird, we haven't caught you yet, but at least we've got you on camera, and now we know what you are:<ep>
   A hornbill. A ground hornbill, in fact. An African native, fond of feeding on frogs, rats and mice, which may explain how you've been able to survive these past several weeks as you've flapped your way around Northeast Dade.<ep>
   The three-foot-tall creature with the turkey-meets-toucan body has been photographed at Normandy School in northern Miami Beach, once a month ago and then again several days ago.<ep>
   ``It was at nap time, so I grabbed a camera and ran outside,'' said Wendy Martinez, the school's assistant administrator, who made the first sighting.<ep>
   Martinez was captivated by the bird's, well, individuality.<ep>
   ``It walked, very distinguished, all over the neighborhood,'' she said. ``It walked very tall.''<ep>
   She followed it for a while with the school's owner, Bob Lomenick. ``It took off flying, right over my boss's head, and the noise (--) oh, my!'' she said.<ep>
   Our hornbill friend may not have realized it, but it had a close call there: ``If I'd have been alert when he'd flown by me, I could have caught him,'' Lomenick said.<ep>
   Actually, though, it's probably for the best that Lomenick missed.<ep>
   ``These birds can bite very, very hard, so people should not take it upon themselves to catch it,'' said Ellen Plachter, admissions supervisor for the Wildlife Care Center in Fort Lauderdale.<ep>
   In Africa, where they are often considered sacred, the ground hornbills thrive even around lots of people, according to the <m0>Encyclopedia of Birds,<m0> published by Facts on File. But in West Africa, some hunters use stuffed heads of ground hornbills as camouflage when stalking game.<ep>
   Here, the bird is probably surviving pretty well on its own. ``It prefers carrion (--) rats, mice, frogs (--) so we do have plenty of food out there for them,'' said Plachter, who has now logged more than two dozen calls on bird sightings.<ep>
   Some of them, though, describe another feathered pair with similar characteristics that have taken up residence along the bay in South Dade, near both the Charles Deering Estate and Fairchild Tropical Garden. That pair hasn't been positively identified yet.<ep>
   Any sightings can be reported to the center, at (954) 524-4302, ext. 6.<ep>
   If they're hornbills as well, they may remain wild for a while.<ep>
 ``It's very elusive,'' Plachter said.<ql>
