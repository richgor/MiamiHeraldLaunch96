<m0>   On May 5, 1862, Mexican forces, outnumbered 3-to-1, fended off an invading French army in the Battle of the Puebla.<ep>
   The date became etched in history as Cinco de Mayo (--) the Mexican day of independence.<ep>
   Miami Beach will help celebrate Mexico's freedom Sunday <m1> <m0>with boisterous, tequila-splashed parties all around town.<ep>
   The loudest cheer for victory will probably be heard from Moe's Cantina, 616 Collins Ave. The 10,000-square-foot restaurant will host a Cinco de Mayo celebration complete with a new brunch menu, a <m0>mariachi<m0> band and 24 different brands of tequila.<ep>
    ``There's something about margaritas that make people have just that much more fun,'' co-owner Conor Lumpkin said.<ep>
   Tequila Girls will rove the premises, offering straight shots or ``upside down margaritas,'' where the mixture is poured into the client's mouth, then the head shaken. These are $3 each.<ep>
   Opened four months, Moe's was designed to look like a genuine Mexican compound. One bar was pulled out of a Juarez, Mexico cantina. Another bar is a replica of a Mexican mission.<ep>
   ``The idea was to have it feel like it's been here for 150 years,'' Lumpkin said.<ep>
   <ep>
   Other Cinco de Mayo celebrations around the beach:<ep>
     (box) Mrs. Mendoza's Tacos Al Carbon restaurant, 1040 Alton Rd., will slash its beer prices and give away T-shirts. Also, Mexican sodas called ``Jarritos'' will be imported just for the day.<ep>
      (box) El Rancho Grande Restaurant, 1626 Pennsylvania Ave., will open at 3 p.m. Sunday, three hours earlier than usual. Margaritas will be $3, beer $2.<ep>
   ``Normally for Cinco de Mayo, it's well packed,'' owner Manuel Ortiz said. ``It's a good way to celebrate Mexico. And it's good for business.''<ep>
      (box) Mex Mess Cantina Mexicana, 1522 Washington Ave., will also celebrate with 10 different Mexican beers and decorations. <m1><ep>
