   Oleta River State Recreation Area, perhaps the best kept secret for recreation in Northeast Dade, is hoping to raise its profile with this weekend's Bud Light Mountain Bike Festival.<ep>
   ``This will give people a reason to come out to the park who don't come out here,'' said Warren Poplin, assistant park manager.<ep>
   The festival, which began Saturday and runs most of today, features races for all experience levels, from first timers to experts, on a new path built over the last several months by a volunteer crew.<ep>
   Fans can watch parts of the race that cut through open areas, and can learn more about mountain biking.<ep>
   Kids will have a race of their own, with parents allowed to lend a steadying hand to help their offspring conquer the hills. A charity race for waiters and bartenders will benefit the Children's Home Society.<ep>
   Next year (--) if there is a next year for this first-time event (--) Poplin hopes the 854-acre park itself will be a beneficiary. This year, festival fans will be paying the usual park entrance fee of $3.25 per car, but that money goes back to the state.<ep>
   The park is getting lots of exposure, though, race promoter Steve Tebon said. Its name has been on everything from entry forms to posters to squeeze bottles.<ep>
   The weekend festival, the first stop on a four-city tour that next travels to Georgia, suffered one black eye last month when the city of North Miami withdrew its offer of support as a local sponsor after its name failed to show up on promotions.<ep>
   Tebon said the error was an oversight caused because the city had committed its support so early in the planning.<ep>
