<m0>   Officer Curtis Johnson was named officer of the year for 1995 for the Surfside Police Department.<ep>
   Johnson has been a member of the Surfside Police Department since 1992. He is currently assigned to the patrol division, but fills in for the sergeant when necessary.<ep>
   ``He has provided a high level of service while projecting a professional image of the Surfside Police Department,'' said Chief Terrill Williamson.<ep>
   During 1995, Johnson investigated several burglaries and thefts, and reclaimed thousands of dollars in property, Williamson said.<ep>
   In one case, Johnson single-handedly arrested three suspects and recovered thousands of dollars in televisions, stereos and power tools.<ep>
   ``We have to acknowledge our officers when they step beyond the call of duty,'' Williamson said. ``His actions this past year entitled him to win the title of officer of the year.''<ep>
