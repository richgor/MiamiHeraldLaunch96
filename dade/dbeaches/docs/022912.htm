   It's getting close to 10 a.m. on a Saturday in May, and a boy named Robert Paul Diaz eagerly watches the clock in the lobby of the Humane Society of Greater Miami.<P>

   Robert Paul is turning 10 years old the next day, and he has come to the North Dade animal shelter with his sister, mom and grandmother to find a puppy.<P>

   Nearby sits Mark Smith, who hopes to take a cat home to his apartment near downtown Miami.<P>

   Finally, they are allowed to go in.<P>

      The five wind their way through a hallway lined with wooden fence boards, which opens onto a long room with a tile floor -- easily mopped.<P>

   On the right are a row of doors and windows of about a half-dozen canine ``apartments,'' each home to two or three dogs.<P>

   Here lives Alfa, a 2-year-old cocker spaniel mix left at the shelter two weeks ago by a grown man with tears in his eyes. The man's neighbors had been complaining about Alfa, and at last he was giving in and entrusting his little friend to strangers.<P>

   In his first days in the shelter, Alfa was inconsolable. He couldn't be coaxed out of his apartment. Today, though, he's wagging his tail happily as the newcomers enter.<P>

      The Diaz family pauses to look through the apartment windows, then moves on to the next room, where about a dozen puppies pad about in individual kennels.<P>

   Almost immediately, Robert Paul, a fourth-grader at Hialeah Elementary, focuses on two who are at least partly golden retriever. Soon, he's cradling one in his arms and declaring it his own.<P>

   ``Don't you think we should go to the other place, too?'' asks his mother, Lucy Diaz.<P>

   He shakes his head no. Then a staffer tells them his dog is male -- a no-no to Mom, who thinks it'll be too aggressive. Luckily, the other pup is a girl.<P>

   ``OK, OK,'' Robert Paul says, quickly putting the first dog back and rushing over to the second one.<P>

      Beyond the puppy area is the cats' room, which is overbooked today, with some kittens two or three to a cage, snuggled together in slumber or boxing each other softly.<P>

   Mark Smith carefully considers each one, cage by cage, from the oversized black adult to the pair of gray and white kittens.<P>

   Pausing for a moment, Smith pulls a leash and collar from his pocket and sighs. ``I was all ready for a dog, but the apartment building said no,'' he says.<P>

   So he settles on the big black cat. Well, actually, that's not quite how it happens.<P>

   ``That cat picked me,'' Smith says. ``That cat stuck its paw out as I walked by, and I wasn't even looking at it. The moment we had . . .''<P>

   He won't name his new pet; it'll just have to answer to ``cat,'' he says. ``I didn't birth that cat, so I don't get to name it.''<P>

Sterilizing a must<P>

   More and more people are arriving to look at the pets, and staffer Grace Carr -- one of about 40 paid workers at this shelter and a smaller one in Cutler Ridge -- is rushing among the three areas.<P>

   Carr helps one couple apply for an adoption, photocopying their photo IDs and finding out what kind of home the pet would have.<P>

   Then she scoops up a black puppy and tells a family they can pick up their new pet in the afternoon, after it's been sterilized.<P>

   No animal goes home without the surgery; population control is a major goal of the clinic. A flier on the wall notes that a pair of breeding cats could produce a tribe of 80 million in just a decade if none were spayed or neutered.<P>

      Back at the front counter, Pat Camas of Kendall is trying to take care of the paperwork for her new dog, a female somehow bestowed with the name Peter.<P>

   The shelter charges $50 (no checks, please) for sterilization, shots and an identifying tattoo, and it also collects the county's $24 dog license fee.<P>

   Camas' check-out is a little more complicated than usual because Peter's information sheet has been chewed into about two dozen pieces.<P>

   ``OK, we know it's a dog,'' Camas says.<P>

`I'll be back to get you'<P>

   <P>

   A little later, Patricia Brownlee picks out a fluorescent-green nylon collar and leash from the lobby display of pet supplies.<P>

   She and husband Eugene are waiting for a staffer to bring out their new dog -- Alfa, the cocker spaniel mix.<P>

   She'd been to the shelter before, and when she had spotted the calm and friendly Alfa in his three-dog apartment, she made him a promise.<P>

   ``The other two dogs were loud and noisy, and I said, `Dog, this ain't your thing. I'll be back to get you tomorrow.' ''<P>

      Besides the lobby, there's another way into the shelter, around back, where people turn in the animals they don't want or can't keep.<P>

   In the average month, the shelters here and in Cuter Ridge take in about 800 dogs and cats, plus the occasional rabbit or hamster.<P>

The dropping-off point<P>

   At the counter is Martha Carballea, who has come from her home near Greynolds Park to drop off a healthy-looking puppy.<P>

   The mother dog had been a stray Carballea had taken in not long ago. She turned out to be pregnant and had a litter of 10, but after setting up a table outside a local Publix, Carballea had found homes for all but this one.<P>

   Puppies like this one are usually adopted quickly, the young man behind the counter assures her.<P>

      Kenny Tatum approaches next, setting a gray plastic animal carrier on the counter. Inside several 8-week-old kittens are curled together. How many?<P>

   ``I don't know, maybe about five,'' answers Tatum, who lives near Miami International Airport. ``We've got a bunch of momma cats running around, and I'm just trying to give some of them to other people.''<P>

   The shelter worker suggests he have the animal spayed so he doesn't have to come back in several months.<P>

   Tatum shrugs. ``If we catch them,'' he says. ``Most of them are wild anyway.''<P>

   The shelter worker asks how much he's going to donate, and Tatum pulls out a folded check, already made out for $30.<P>

   Tatum is followed by Llamile Diamond of Miami, who has a huge shepherd mix called Blackie on a leash. Diamond had taken the dog home the day before, but now she's decided she wants to trade her in for a different pet.<P>

   ``They told us she was an inside/outside dog, but she only wanted to be inside,'' Diamond says. ``She didn't even want to eat or anything. She didn't even bark.''<P>

   The shelter takes Blackie back, but she is told she can't have another dog until her home is inspected.<P>

Because they love animals<P>

   <P>

   Beyond the receiving-area counter are the animals that are waiting for a doctor's check.<P>

   About a quarter of them will find new homes. A few will go to Broward's shelter, but most of the rest will be put to sleep, the likely fate of a gray-spotted puppy -- a terrier, perhaps -- whimpering and shivering in one of the holding pens.<P>

   The anxious animal is longing for an affectionate rub, even just one tender touch, but Scott Jelescheff, the center's volunteer coordinator, knows better.<P>

   The puppy has mange, a parasitic skin disease that can spread easily to people and other animals, and the shelter must remain vigilant to prevent epidemics.<P>

   ``It's not fair to take all our resources and pour them into one animal when we've got eight more healthy ones over here. How nice a dog it is doesn't matter,'' Jelescheff says.<P>

   ``It's kind of a Catch-22. If we turned him into the street, he'd probably die a much worse death than to be put to death humanely. The people here kill animals because they love them.'' <BR>
At the clinic<P>

      Across the parking lot sits the Humane Society's well-animal clinic, which offers low-cost shots and sterilization to the public.<P>

   Carolina Yaya and Edison Montes have brought their cocker spaniel Pumpkin all the way from Kendall on the advice of Yaya's mother.<P>

   Part-time veterinarian Jeff Bayard gives Pumpkin a shot, then asks the couple if they've started the dog on a monthly anti-worm pill yet.<P>

   ``No . . .'' Yaya answers slowly.<P>

   Bayard pulls out a plastic model of an infected animal heart and explains how common the problem is in South Florida's warm weather. Worms can grow to more than a foot long, causing fatal problems like heart failure.<P>

   ``Muy importante,'' says a nodding Yaya.<P>

   ``Muy, muy importante,'' Bayard agrees.<P>

Their final home<P>

      Behind the clinic, a large lawn is littered with marble and stone markers.<P>

   A painted wooden sign labels the area the Oaklawn Pet Cemetery, home for half a century to hundreds of dearly departed dogs, cats, birds -- even horses and a few people, including local Humane Society founder Charles William Pusey.<P>

   At the center, a life-size statue of a Great Dane stands sentinel. A stone at the base of the dog reads, ``Polar Prince 1934-1949 Hyland.''<P>

   Silk flowers and ceramic figurines decorate many of the plots.<P>

   At one grave, red satin poinsettias and a gold figurine of a Great Dane form a shrine to the beloved Sonia. ``Aun asi te sigo queriendo mi fiel amiga,'' the plaque says. ``Even now I love you, my faithful friend.''<P>

      Around the edge of the cemetery, a small, black lab walks with a woman who goes only by Nynda -- she never uses her last name because she's going to be a rock star one day.<P>

   Nynda comes by every Saturday to give the shelter dogs some exercise, and she loves reading the grave markers as she strolls through.<P>

   Her favorite, to a trio of pets who died in the 1970s, reads, ``Each its own master, dominated by none. Love, devotion, companionship in life and for eternity.''<P>

   The first time she saw it, it gave her chills, she says.<P>

   ``It's funny,'' she says. ``Some people love animals so much, and others just don't care.''
