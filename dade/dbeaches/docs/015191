   What kind of cake do you bake for the leader of the free world?<ep>
   Butter cream.<ep>
   President Bill Clinton took time from his busy schedule in Miami Monday to celebrate the 70th birthday of the Biltmore Hotel (--) cutting a cake shaped almost exactly like the Coral Gables landmark.<ep>
   The bakers (--) owners of Three Little Cakes at 10855 Sunset Dr. (--) almost dismissed the order as a crank call. ``I thought it was a joke,'' said Sara Beers, who owns the bakery with her parents Alfredo and Maria Magluta.<ep>
   But it wasn't. And, after four days of preparation, the family delivered the cake in a rented U-Haul about 11:45 a.m. Monday.<ep>
   They were told Clinton, at the Biltmore for a fund-raiser and a little golf, would cut the cake (--) not eat it. After all, there had been no cake control, no Secret Service agents checking ingredients or inspecting the bakery.<ep>
     ``Nobody looked at it. We could have put in anything we wanted to,'' Beers said.<ep>
   Clinton looked at it. Biltmore spokeswoman Stephanie Kirby said the President at first didn't want to cut the cake and ruin it.<ep>
   But after he did, he quickly took a bite.<ep>
     ``He thought it was very good,'' Kirby said.<ep>
   The $800 cake took four days to prepare. A postcard of the historic hotel was used for the model. The final cake came complete with little cars on the driveway, awnings, the fountain in front and palm trees all over.<ep>
   ``First you have to plan out the shape for it to look right proportion-wise,'' said Beers, the decorator. That took one day. Then she cut pieces of the building out of Styrofoam and iced them, mixing many colors to come up with the right historic hues.<ep>
   The day before delivery, the actual cake (--) butter pound with butter cream filling, icing and meringue (--) was baked. Monday morning they applied the finishing touches: bushes, trees, and blue icing for the foaming water in the fountain.<ep>
     It's not the first building cake constructed by the Magluta family. They've made an exact replica of Baptist Hospital that measured four feet by eight feet.<ep>
   ``That one took us 10 days,'' Maria Magluta said. ``They asked for it with windows and everything, exactly.''<ep>
   The Maglutas have been baking for more than 40 years. In 1961, they opened what they say was the first Cuban bakery in exile: Los Pinos Nuevos on Southwest Eighth Street and 18th Avenue.<ep>
   Months earlier they had arrived from Bejucal, a small town near Havana, with an 8-year-old daughter and an infant girl, a change of clothes and $5.<ep>
   Both girls started working in the bakery very young. ``Sara started when she was 12,'' said her mother, 64.<ep>
   ``Child labor,'' muttered Beers, 33, putting the finishing touches Friday on a special order birthday cake (--) a castle to match the little girl's party invitations. She also excels at sharks. She made her first shark cake two years ago for her son Adam, then 9. ``He asked me why I didn't put someone in the shark's mouth.''<ep>
   Recently, the Maglutas got a request from Luther Campbell, the raucous rapper of raunchy fame. His secretary wanted a cake in the silhouette of a shapely naked woman.<ep>
   ``We don't do anything obscene,'' Beers said. They compromised on a woman's torso in a bikini. ``She said he loved it. We got invited to the party.''<ep>
   Friday, the bakers got another strange request.<ep>
   ``Someone wants a cake shaped like the family dog,'' Maria Magluta said. ``On roller skates. I'm going to have to go home now and think about it.<ep>
   ``Tomorrow, we'll make it.''<ql>
