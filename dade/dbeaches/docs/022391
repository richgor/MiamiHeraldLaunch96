   Miami Beach condo resident Geraldine Issod was awakened at 7 a.m. Tuesday with a report of bad news. Her husband's 1993 Lexus, as well as nine other cars parked at The Executive, 4925 Collins Ave., had been broken into earlier that morning.<ep>
   ``I was really surprised,`` said Issod, who has lived at the building for 18 years, as she removed broken glass from the car's passenger seat. ``We've never had this happen in all of the years that I've been here.''<ep>
   Miami Beach police say they have no suspects in the break-ins.<ep>
   The culprits apparently didn't get away with much. According to Roy Sitomer, the building's manager, Issod's cellular phone and $7.50 in quarters, and a videocassette recorder in a Ford Explorer, were the only items stolen.<ep>
   The burglars, police said, targeted six Lexuses in hopes of stealing them by obtaining a spare key that is often attached to Lexus owners' manuals.<ep>
   ``Many owners forget to remove them,'' Auto Crimes Unit Sgt. Lenny Alamo said. ``We've heard in the past that thieves look for this.''<ep>
   Although the building's front desk is staffed by an overnight security guard, and three television cameras monitor the parking garage, the guard apparently didn't hear or see the break-ins.<ep>
   ``The whole incident is very odd,'' Sitomer said. ``I just don't get it.''<ep>
   Sitomer said he plans to increase lighting in the building's front parking lot, where three cars were ransacked, and repair the faulty garage gates.<ql>
