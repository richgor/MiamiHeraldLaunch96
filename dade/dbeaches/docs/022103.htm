   Beach Towing, traditionally a thorn in the side of Miami Beach residents and revelers, is trying to make life easier for them.<P>

   The company will pick up Beach residents and tourists who have had too much to drink and take them and their car home.<P>

   No questions, no charge.<P>

   ``Around 75 percent of the people you go to pick up are drunk,'' said Tony Rivera, manager of the tow company at 1349 Dade Blvd. ``We're just trying to do something different, trying to help the people. If you drink and drive, you go to jail. We try to avoid that.''<P>

   The offer extends only to Beach residents or tourists vacationing at area hotels. Callers need to have a car, he said, and be willing to wait about 45 minutes on weekends.<P>

   Rivera said Beach Towing has been offering this service for years but had never publicized it. Thus, few people knew about it.<P>

   Recently, the company began posting signs of the service on the side of pay phones, handing out fliers. <P>

   ``I think it's a great service,'' said Dave Kolstad, manager at Rose's Bar and Music Lounge, 754 Washington Ave. ``Any community could use it, but especially us, since we're so much into the club and bar scene. There's a lot of drunks on the road.''<P>

   Rivera said his company was prompted to offer the service after witnessing several accidents involving drunk drivers.<P>

   ``If you call us, you won't go to jail, you won't get into an accident and you don't pay for the towing,'' Rivera said. ``Just don't throw up in the truck.''
