   Each patch tells a tragic story.<P>

   The blue one with the picture and the inscription ``Deeply Missed and Loved'' is for Bart Talbot. Three years ago, a drunk driver ran a stop sign and hit his Jeep. Talbot went through 10 hours of surgery and spent three days in a coma.<P>

   He didn't make it.<P>

   The patch for Richie Stanley II shows him surfing. Stitched in the fabric is his beeper code, too. Two days before graduating as an honors student from Palm Beach Community College, he, too, was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. He was 19.<P>

   Their misfortune has been a blessing for people they never knew while alive. That's how they wanted it. Early on, they made the decision to become organ donors, and together they have saved nine lives.<P>

   ``He was always so giving -- always helping others, touching so many lives,'' said Lucy Stanley, fighting back tears. ``The pain will never go away, but knowing that he was an organ donor helps. Because of him, others live.''<P>

   Along with dozens of other organ donors, Stanley and Talbot are being honored with a quilt that treasures their gift. Stitched together by three local women whose sons died in car accidents, and were organ donors, the 10-by-15 foot quilt is decorated with pictures of loved ones and messages etched in the fabric. Some patches have beads on them, others have lace. One, shipped from Louisiana, is part of a woman's dress.<P>

   The quilt was on display recently at the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center, 20400 NE 30th Ave. After a tour to other parts of Florida and Washington, D.C., the quilt will return to the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital, where coordinator Linda McBeath has a small office. The quilt will travel to several sites around the Southeast, where families of other donors will add their own patches.<P>

   ``All we have left is pictures and memories,'' Stanley said. ``That's why we're trying to keep Richie's memory alive -- and the lives of others who have given the gift of life, by being organ donors. Every piece has so much to say about so many people.''<P>

      Like Gail Dickinson's son, Talbot. He loved the water and had just got a job as a fish and wildlife officer. He was working toward becoming a marine patrol officer. When the accident happened, he was on his way home from a bike ride in Coconut Grove.<P>

   ``He always enjoyed life to the fullest,'' Dickinson said. ``I remember the last time we spoke. He said, `I'm either going surfing or to the Grove to go bicycling.' I told him to be careful and he said, `Oh, Mom -- I don't drink and drive or speed. You know me, I'm always careful.' "<P>

      Lucy Stanley's son loved the water, too. Richie's picture, a surfboard under his arm, is on the patch, along with his beeper code ``28-7873.'' He wore his favorite number, 28, on his jersey at Palmetto High, where he played lacrosse. When he beeped friends with the numbers ``7873,'' that meant he wanted to go surfing.<P>

   McBeath, whose son died 10 years ago and was an organ donor, helped Dickinson and Stanley deal with their loss. She came up with the idea for the quilt about a year ago, after hearing of a quilt made in memory of those who died of AIDS.<P>

   McBeath also has given the families of organ donors an opportunity to have contact with recipients, who remain anonymous. For example, Stanley knows a 34-year-old Jacksonville woman got a kidney transplant -- thanks to her son.<P>

   ``I know she loves water sports,'' Stanley said. ``She wrote in a letter that because of him, she can enjoy the water again. It was very touching.''<P>

   The quilt has done something else for Stanley and the other two women.<P>

   ``Through our sons -- even in sorrow -- we've come together,'' Stanley said. ``We've become so close because we've got so much in common.''
