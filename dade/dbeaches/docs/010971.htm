   Students from Miami Beach High won the Critics' Choice award in ensemble acting at the Florida State Thespian Festival in Tampa. They performed a scene from the play Latins Anonymous, which deals with Hispanic stereotypes in movies and plays.<P>

   ``When we won I yelled louder than any yell ever heard. I'm so excited,'' said Gary Graff, the theater arts director at Beach High.<P>

   Now the students have the chance to compete in the International Thespian Festival at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln June 25-30. The festival will feature guest speakers and performers, acting workshops and various college representatives.<P>

   Graff said lack of money is the only thing holding them back. The students need to raise $4,000 by May 20 -- and they are planning various fund-raisers, such as car washes and a dinner theater. They will also accept donations, Graff said.<P>

   ``We're hoping and praying we can raise the money and represent Beach High at the competition,'' said Mia Cruz, 17, a junior. <P>

   The five-minute scene depicts four actors auditioning for a role in a play: Pablo Martini, 17, plays a Mexican named Chano; Mia is Pablo's Mexican girlfriend named Maria; Ananta Marra, 18, plays a Puerto Rican named Chino; and Maritza Morales, 18, is Marra's Puerto Rican girlfriend also named Maria. Joseph Renghini, 18, plays the director who is auditioning the four actors.<P>

   ``The play is saying something about stereotypes in a funny way,'' Morales, 18, said. ``In movies all Hispanic women are Maria and all Puerto Ricans are called Chino.''<P>

   Morales, a junior, said the characters try to ``out Hispanic'' each other. The Mexican Maria ends up shooting the Puerto Rican Maria because the Puerto Rican Maria is louder and sassier than she is.<P>

   ``In the play, I'm covering her up. I'm out-staging her, so she kills me,'' Morales said.''<P>

   Chino and Chano also end up dead after getting into a fight over whose performance was better, more Hispanic. The scene ends with the director telling the actors they need heavier Hispanic accents.<P>

   The students rehearsed the scene for about two months before taking it to the state competition, which attracted more than 3,700 entries -- about 75 of them were in ensemble acting.<P>

   ``We were the last audition of the day. So we all thought the judges just would want to get out of there and finish,'' Cruz said. ``But they loved it. They couldn't stop laughing.''
