T<BR>
he city of Miramar has declared a state of emergency at the infamous tire dump otherwise known as Hampshire Homes.<P>

  Twenty irate residents now behold a watery crater the size of a football field behind their houses, courtesy of the subdivision's developer, Lennar Homes.<P>

  It's a mess for the families but also big trouble for Lennar, which is no stranger to customer complaints or rotten publicity. If company executives are smart, they'll take the suggestion of Miramar Commissioner Sandy Lucas and buy back all the dumpfront houses it sold.<P>

  Excavation began after alarmed Hampshire homeowners noticed sinkholes appearing in the ``common area'' behind their lots. Soon it became evident why the surface was caving in:<P>

  Somebody had buried trash beneath it -- tons of tires, rotting tree limbs, rusty appliances and construction debris. More than 250 truckloads were carried out.<P>

  As the pit deepened and filled with brown water, the city erected a security fence and assigned police officers to guard the site, so neighborhood kids wouldn't get hurt or drown.<P>

  Last Thursday, to the applause of more than 100 Hampshire Homes owners, Miramar commissioners vowed to lead the battle to obtain relief from Lennar. It's the least they can do, considering the city's indefensible negligence in allowing the firm to build around a tire dump.<P>

  While the parameters of the underground trash trove still are being measured, homeowners are understandably worried that their houses might be standing on top of it, and might one day start sinking into loose ground.<P>

  It wouldn't be the first man-made calamity to befall Lennar home buyers, as those who watched their homes crumble in Hurricane Andrew can attest.<P>

  The company has not yet revealed who dumped the tires and trash at Hampshire Homes, or who covered them up.<P>

   Lennar has promised to remedy the situation as soon as possible.<P>

  The good news is the water in the pit apparently isn't toxic to humans or wildlife. The bad news: The pit could be filled with Chanel No. 5 and residents still would have a hard time unloading those houses at a decent price.<P>

  Lennar Corp. can easily afford to buy them back and call in the bulldozers. Last year, the company reported record earnings of $70.4 million, despite a dip in housing sales.<P>

  And in the first three months of this year, operating earnings of the home-building division jumped 23 percent as Lennar delivered 1,176 new homes nationwide. None, however, were advertised as dumpfront property.<P>

  By bailing out the residents of Hampshire Homes, Lennar could dodge a long nasty lawsuit and reams of bad press, neither of which will do much to boost future sales.<P>

  Beyond its strategic advantages, a buy-back has another selling point: Morally, it's the right thing to do.<P>

  Even the most careful home buyers wouldn't think to ask a developer: ``Oh, by the way, is there a huge tire dump buried anywhere near my new house?''<P>

   It's no wonder the folks who invested their savings in Hampshire Homes feel deceived and aggravated. Every day they stare out their windows at a vast murky pit.<P>

  Lennar could fill it in with dirt, plant some trees, put in a nice playground or a bridle path -- and pray that no more sinkholes appear.<P>

  Or Lennar could do the right thing by its customers. Either repurchase their homes at market value, or trade straight-up for new ones.<P>

  Heck, with 1,176 to choose from, they should be able to find something  in a dump-free neighborhood.
