<m0>hen the cop car's rockin', don't come knockin'.<ep>
  That's the message from Metro commissioners, who voted to richly compensate a policeman who got caught having sex in a parking garage.<ep>
  For his bare-bottomed indiscretion, Jesus ``Romeo'' Bencomo will now receive $180,000 and a pension of $50,000 a year. Talk about an afterglow.<ep>
  The moment of rapture occurred on March 21, 1994, when a security guard at Miami Children's Hospital spotted a black Chevrolet shaking back and forth. The guard feared a rape was occurring and called for help.<ep>
  An off-duty Metro detective pulled his gun and approached. Inside the car, a man and woman were carnally entwined. The detective recognized the man as Bencomo, a division chief for the department.<ep>
  When disciplinary charges were filed, Bencomo offered a chaste version of the incident. He said he'd met a woman dressed in white and offered her a lift. He said they'd had an innocent chat in the front seat of his county Chevy, but no nookie.<ep>
  The best part? He said he never got the woman's name.<ep>
  A police review panel was not persuaded by Bencomo's yarn and sustained charges of using a county vehicle for personal business and conduct unbecoming a police officer (--) engaging ``in open lewd and lascivious behavior.''<ep>
  Metro Police director Fred Taylor demoted Bencomo to major in December 1994.<ep>
  After such a dumb screw-up, most cops would've been thrilled to still have a job, especially one that paid $93,000 a year. Not our Romeo. He claimed he was the target of a political vendetta.<ep>
  He sued the police department. He sued the detective who caught him in the act. He even went to a federal agency and charged he was the victim of anti-Hispanic discrimination.<ep>
  Seriously, that's what the man said.<ep>
  Could Bencomo prove that black cops and white cops are allowed to have sex in police cars, while Hispanic cops are forced to use their own personal vehicles? We'll never know, since the case isn't going to trial.<ep>
  This week the Metro Commission decided to pay Bencomo off, in exchange for his dropping all claims. Taylor and a majority of commissioners said settling the case now was cheaper than litigating it for years.<ep>
  While the move saves the county some legal fees, it also spares the police some unwanted embarrassment. Bencomo's lawyer had hinted that, after 28 years on the force, his client had lots of fascinating anecdotes about the antics of other officers, as well as prominent politicians.<ep>
  It's unknown whether the allegations would have involved sex in squad cars, paddy wagons, helicopters or body armor.<ep>
  In any event, a mud bath is being avoided at a public cost of $180,000. With such a windfall, Bencomo should be able to afford a motel room the next time lust overcomes him.<ep>
  Ironically, the precedent set by the settlement ultimately could offset any short-term savings. The county might end up paying out a fortune if other cops in disciplinary trouble use the Bencomo case as a blueprint for counterattack:<ep>
  Sue everyone in sight, threaten to smear the department and then demand an obscene settlement.<ep>
  Given the Metro Commission's willingness to cave in, risk-management experts should consider a new policy:<ep>
  If you see a parked police car rocking like crazy, assume the officer is testing the shock absorbers. Don't investigate (--) it's too expensive.<ep>
  For Bencomo, his interlude in the county Chevy undoubtedly will be his most memorable ever. Not only did the earth move, so did the blood pressure of a million taxpayers.<ql>
