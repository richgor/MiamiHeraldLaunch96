<m0>he denizens of Dysfunctional America have decided, in advance of trial, that hermit Ted Kaczynski <m0>is<m0> the Unabomber and worthy of hero worship.<ep>
  Odes and tributes to the suspect flash across the Internet, while the Unabomber's tedious 35,000-word manifesto remains in popular demand at libraries and bookstores. Bumper stickers and T-shirts are in the works.<ep>
  To his fans, what separates the Unabomber from your run-of-the-mill mass murderer is the perception he actually stands for something, and that he killed in the name of a noble cause.<ep>
  His famous windy diatribe, published last September in The Washington Post and New York Times, railed against modern technology and preached for a return to nature.<ep>
  Never mind that the piece could've benefited from an editor's pencil. Many killers have trouble stringing two or three cogent sentences together, but here was one who could give Faulkner or Joyce a run for their money!<ep>
  Not only did the Unabomber know how to peck a typewriter, he also expressed strong political beliefs (--) not especially original ones, but beliefs nonetheless. In these vapid times, that qualifies as hero material, even if you're basically a pathetic coward who anonymously mails exploding packages to people.<ep>
  One drawback in trying to lionize the Unabomber is his sorry track record. In 17 years of violent underground protest, he hasn't accomplished a darn thing. Murdering that timber company executive, for example, didn't save a single pine tree from the logger's ax.<ep>
  In fact, the Unabomber's choice of targets was so disparate and unpredictable that authorities had no clear fix on his political agenda, until he delivered his rambling manifesto to the newspapers last fall.<ep>
  Now he's a star of the World Wide Web, where he is embraced by aging hippies for his devout environmentalism, and praised by modern militia types for his cranky defiance of government.<ep>
  Una-losers from all walks of life can take a lesson from this case: Before you shoot anybody or blow up anything, get yourself a clever ghostwriter, one who can make you sound like a deep thinker or a social crusader.<ep>
  That's where those goons who bombed the federal building in Oklahoma screwed up, public-relations wise. They produced no manifestos, no treatises, no monographs, no essays, not one lousy pamphlet to explain away their horrible crime.<ep>
  Consequently, the men accused of that slaughter aren't being portrayed as heroes by hardly anyone, including the paranoid fruitcakes who believe they were framed. Even among the ultra-right, martyrdom is the most Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols can ever hope for.<ep>
  Ted Kaczynski, by contrast, is being urged by his Internet fan club to run for president. And those hailing him as a folk hero wouldn't be doing it if they didn't think he's guilty. Otherwise he'll be useless as a legend.<ep>
  From Jesse James to Patty Hearst, outlaws with political beefs often attract a constituency. To explain why people identify with such criminals, experts cite kindred feelings of distrust, alienation, and powerlessness against the onrush of society.<ep>
  Literature is full of loners fighting valiantly against impossible odds, and to some the Unabomber fits that role. To most others, though, there's nothing brave or romantic about sending explosives to defenseless strangers.<ep>
  At his weakling core, the Unabomber is nothing but a frustrated writer who blew off people's arms and legs to get himself published. Even then, he couldn't find the courage to put his real name on his words and ideas.<ep>
  Some hero, this guy. He signed his work only with other men's blood.<ql>
