<B><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT></B>he secret videotapes from the aborted corruption investigation into Dade zoning practices offered no surprises, only a stark confirmation:<P>

  The system in 1989 was every bit as rotten as you thought. And if you think it's different today, you're right: It's worse.<P>

  True, the transaction of vote selling probably was simpler a few years ago. It had to be, in order for a dunce like Jorge ``No Visible Means of Support'' Valdes to grasp it.<P>

  Then a county commissioner, Valdes had a starring role in the undercover tapes compiled by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. At one point he garrulously expounded on his policy of taking cash only ``under the table'' so there's no trace.<P>

  (Confronted with his own words, Valdes now claims he was merely acting.)<P>

  Valdes' chief role on the Metro Commission was to do whatever the Latin Builders Association told him to do. On zoning votes, he and Steve Clark were the LBA's most loyal toadies.<P>

  It therefore was entirely logical for then-LBA Executive Director Jorge Abril to serve as the liaison between developers seeking favors and commissioners who gave them.<P>

  The tone of Abril's taped discussions about bribing county politicians is straightforward and matter-of-fact. That an LBA big shot was immersed in such slime isn't earthshaking news to anyone who follows local politics.<P>

  Nor is the taped performance of zoning lawyer Tom Carlos, casually explaining how his clients must be prepared to ``work'' the Metro Commission.<P>

  Add to this luminous cast Mr. Pablo Valdes, a home builder once spotlighted on the cover of the LBA's magazine. That was before it became known Pablo bankrolled his developments with laundered cocaine money.<P>

  It was he who, in exchange for leniency, agreed to help authorities blow the lid off Dade zoning corruption.<P>

  The best part? While an informant, Pablo was allowed to continue building houses in Hialeah Gardens. The source of his capital, and his scummy past, were kept secret from creditors, colleagues and customers, some of whom found their lots flooded after it rained.<P>

  Questions about Pablo's character, and bickering among law-enforcement agencies, eventually doomed the 1989 bribery probe. It's a shame because prosecutors lost a chance to purge the county of some congenital crooks, and to save the master land-use plan from becoming a sham.<P>

  Over the years, corrupt zoning in South Florida has ruined neighborhoods, paralyzed traffic and nearly exploded the school systems. Locking up a few thieving politicians might have scared the others into behaving, at least for a while.<P>

  Since the Pablo Valdes case fell apart, little has changed at the Metro Commission except a few of the names.<P>

  Steve Clark mercifully departed to become mayor of Miami, while Jorge Valdes was booted out of office by disgusted voters. But among new commissioners the LBA has found trusty lapdogs in Bruce Kaplan, Natacha Millan and others.<P>

  The group has lost none of its clout. Exhibit A: Metro's recent giveaway of the Homestead air base development rights to the HABDI group, led by LBA President Carlos Herrera.<P>

  (Imagine the pang of nostalgia felt by ex-Commissioner Valdes when that rich Homestead deal went down, and he wasn't there to vote on it.)<P>

  With undeveloped land vanishing fast under concrete, the stakes are even higher now than in 1989. Every zoning vote is more valuable, and lawbreakers on both sides know it.<P>

  Ask any honest developer if things have gotten better in Dade County. The answer, wedged between expletives, is an emphatic no.<BR>
