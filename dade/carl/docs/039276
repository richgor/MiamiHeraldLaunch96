<m0>alk about an exercise in futility: The Monroe County Christian Coalition-South is campaigning to sanitize Key West's annual ``Fantasy Fest'' extravaganza.<ep>
  They'd have a better chance of converting Heidi Fleiss.<ep>
  Fed up with drunken rowdiness, festive toplessness and the occasional biker masquerading as latex genitalia, critics say it's time to clean up the infamous Halloween parade.<ep>
  Here's a more sensible plan: If you don't like Fantasy Fest, get out of town until it's over.<ep>
  That's what plenty of locals do, and not always on moral grounds. They just prefer not to deal with the crowds, the traffic, the noise or that vomity morning-after breeze from Duval Street.<ep>
  Folks appalled by spangled breasts and huge clog-dancing sexual appliances would likewise be better off avoiding the parade rather than trying to subdue it. History shows it's virtually impossible to clean up anything in Key West, from piracy to politics.<ep>
  But the conservative Christian Coalition-South is gamely pressing its Fantasy Fest crusade. Members are asking authorities to outlaw public drinking, arrest revelers who peel off their clothes, and ban the use of body paint for parade costumes.<ep>
  Which means you'd need a jail the size of Fort Jefferson to lock up everyone who breaks the law.<ep>
  Reformers aim to transform the holiday weekend into a wholesome family affair, instead of a bawdy and sometimes shocking Bacchanalia.<ep>
  Supporters contend that being bawdy and shocking is precisely what attracts 50,000 free-spending visitors to Key West during the October doldrums, and that a Disney-style parade would be about as popular as ebola.<ep>
  Caught in the middle are county and city commissioners who must try to appear morally upright without wrecking the town's most lucrative tourist weekend (which, not coincidentally, is also its raunchiest).<ep>
  In a wan stab at compromise, authorities have agreed to keep body-painting booths off public property, curb some of the more explicit costumes, and stop advertising Fantasy Fest as an ``adult'' event.<ep>
  At this point they could promote it as a Billy Graham rally and it wouldn't make any difference. Anyone dim enough to attend the pageant and <m0>not<m0> expect to see outrageous behavior needs neurological attention.<ep>
  Past efforts to tame Fantasy Fest bombed spectacularly. A few years ago, Key West declared a crackdown on open liquor containers and exhibitionism. Merchants reeled as people stayed away by the bus loads.<ep>
  So much for the argument that a G-rated parade would draw a better class of tourist, and more of them. Obviously, visitors were coming for the fun of the freak show.<ep>
  Critics seem hampered by a fundamental misunderstanding of Key West's image and why people go there. Never in the lively history of the island has it been known for its sobriety, moral rectitude or family values.<ep>
  From its wild beginnings, the town represented an escape; the last stop on the highway for outlaws, outcasts and dreamers. It has always been a relatively tolerant place because it couldn't afford not to be.<ep>
  Which doesn't mean everyone who lives there ought to be forced to watch a parade that offends them, or wade through a sea of drunks to reach the grocery store.<ep>
  The answer is simple: Don't go.<ep>
  Rent a movie. Read a book. Drive to Miami for the weekend.<ep>
  It's easier than trying to change Fantasy Fest into a drowsy tropical edition of the Rose Bowl Parade, which it can never be. Trying to body-paint Key West as Mainstream America would make the silliest costume of all.<ep>
