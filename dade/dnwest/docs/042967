   Nowadays, mothers are anything but a standard group. There are mothers on the corporate track, mothers who are fitness gurus, mothers who wear tattoos, mothers who fight causes and mothers who choose to stay home and take care of the children.<ep>
   To keep up with the changes, it is now time to update those gift-giving ideas for Mother's Day. Here are some unconventional ways to honor mom.<ep>
   For the mom who wants a thrill, a flight on a small-engine plane may be the perfect gift.<ep>
   ``We get quite a few calls every year,'' said Alexander Fabio, marketing director at Husta Aviation, located at Opa-locka and Tamiami airports. Each year, Fabio said they get about 10 calls from sons and daughters who want to take their mom on an aerial tour of Miami Beach. Its cost: $80.<ep>
   ``Once the children are grown and out of the house, some mothers start feeling a little braver,'' Fabio said. ``Not that flying is unsafe.''<ep>
   For the mom who wants to learn how to explore the Internet, computer training is a smart investment.<ep>
   APS Training Centers, with locations in Miami Lakes, Kendall and Plantation, offer special packages in computer training for Mother's Day.<ep>
   ``It's giving the gift of knowledge,'' said Cheryl Gottlieb, president of APS. ``It is a wonderful opportunity for growth.''<ep>
   The company offers a day of computer training for $99, plus $35 for an instructional book. Classes range in degree of difficulty from the basics to learning how to use different software applications and how to use the Internet.<ep>
   For busy moms who may need a day of pampering, a visit to the spa is a good standard gift.<ep>
   It's called the total Body Fango Spa of Tranquility on Bay Harbor Islands. For $65, workers apply mud from the neck down. After rinsing, workers apply a rich moisturizing cream.<ep>
   ``It's an incredibly rejuvenating and refreshing feeling,'' said <m1> <m0>receptionistArleen Lauton. The Mother's Day Special is called the Tranquil Renewal, a two-hour treatment that includes a steam bath with oils, a sea-salt body scrub and a Swedish massage.<ep>
   ``It's something you don't really do for yourself,'' she said.<ep>
