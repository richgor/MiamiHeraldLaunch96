   Some mothers got an early, albeit unusual, Mother's Day gift last week: they tagged along with their daughters to work at a Miami Lakes company.<P>

   The gift was compliments of Staff Builders Home Care, a home health agency. Eighteen mothers were able to see the ins and outs of their daughters' workplace Wednesday in the company's first ``Take Your Mom To Work Day.''<P>

   Eileen Gilman said her mother, Rose Eidelberg, had never in her 82 years seen her at work.<P>

   ``My mother was surprised by the size of the company and how complicated my job was,'' said Gilman, of Broward, who oversees patient referrals from physicians. ``But she loved it.''<P>

   It was the same for many of the mothers, said Sue Dibeler, program coordinator.<P>

   Although the daughters often describe what they do, it is different to actually see it, she said.<P>

   ``It was fabulous,'' said Dibeler, who lives in Miami Lakes. ``All the mothers had a good time.''<P>

   The day began with an orientation ceremony where the mothers were briefed on the company. They then took tours of the facility before spending time watching their daughters at work. Some of the mothers even helped answer phones and take messages.<P>

   ``My mother felt like a queen,'' said Adriana Cardeso, of Miami Lakes. She took her mother, Mercedes Pe&ntilde;a, to work. ``She said everyone was so professional and nice.''<P>

   The program not only included birth mothers, but other women who have had a significant impact on the workers' lives. There was a grandmother, sister, aunt and a friend -- all who filled the role of ``mom'' for some of the workers.<P>

 <P>

   ``My mother had a wonderful time,'' Gilman said. ``She can't wait to come back next year.''
