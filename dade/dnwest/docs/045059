   When Hialeah police detective Livio ``Lee'' Suarez wants to shoot his subjects, he doesn't do it in uniform.<ep>
   Suarez (--) named March officer of the month for unraveling a half-million-dollar embezzlement case (--) doubles as a professional photographer in his spare time. His photos have appeared in a half-dozen sports magazines including Deportes, Sports Forum and College and Pro Football News Weekly.<ep>
   A conscientious crimes-property detective with a personnel file full of 23 department commendations and 21 thank you letters from residents, Suarez has earned a dare-devil reputation behind the lens.<ep>
   ``He'll take risks when it comes to taking photos,'' said his wife Maria. ``I think it's more dangerous for him than being a cop.''<ep>
   Maria winces as she recalls the family day trip her husband planned to the Everglades one summer (--) during the peak of mosquito season. Maria and their two children refused to leave the car as Suarez stepped forth intrepidly, camera in hand. Within seconds, a black cloud of biting bugs descended upon him. Maria shakes her head at the memory; he chuckles.<ep>
   A little closer to home in Joe Robbie Stadium, Suarez was on the receiving end of a touchdown pass to Miami Dolphin Eric Green. Green was pushed out of bounds as he caught the pass and landed on Suarez.<ep>
   Green asked Suarez if he was OK. Suarez's reply: ``The camera's fine.''<ep>
   While out shooting photos, Suarez said personal safety comes second to getting a good photo. And normally an enforcer of the law, Suarez sheepishly admits he has bent the rules to get a good photo.<ep>
   Before enrolling in the police academy more than 12 years ago, Suarez jumped a safety railing at Metrozoo and planted his camera between cage bars to shoot a tiger close up.<ep>
   ``He waited until it pounced before falling back,'' recalls Lt. John Seay, a childhood chum who convinced Suarez to take photography with him in high school. ``He tripped and hurt his back, but he got a great shot.''<ep>
   As a detective, Suarez's photo fascination has helped catch thieves on film as they have pillaged Hialeah homes. And when the department's ID technicians are not available, Suarez has photographed crime scenes.<ep>
   But his best undercover work has come during his off-duty photography, said robbery detective Sam Fadel. Suarez has smuggled cameras into concerts to shoot performers such as Bon Jovi, Rod Stewart, Michael Bolton and the Eagles.<ep>
   Chides Fadel: ``Instead of shooting bad guys, he's shooting rock stars.''<ep>
