<m0>   With just over month until summer, some Hialeah Gardens residents are making sure kids have something to do by starting a Hialeah Gardens Optimist Club.<ep>
    ``We have a park,'' said Lucy Valdez, a City Council member who takes her sons to the YMCA in neighboring Hialeah to play sports. ``Now we need some type of organized sports.''<ep>
   Valdez and former Hialeah Gardens mayor Greg Read are heading efforts to begin a club in the city.<ep>
   ``We need at least 25 people to join,'' Valdez said.<ep>
   Parents who are members will receive a 25 percent discount on each child who signs up for the athletic programs.<ep>
   Along with a baseball team, the club hopes to establish an academic program in September.<ep>
   The next club meeting is at 7:30 p.m. May 22 at Sir Pizza, 7900 NW 103rd St. For more information, call Read at 237-1114 any time.<ep>
