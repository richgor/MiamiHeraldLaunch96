   Nowadays, mothers are anything but a standard group. There are mothers on the corporate track, mothers who are fitness gurus, mothers who wear tattoos, mothers who fight causes and mothers who choose to stay home and take care of the children.<ep>
   To keep up with the changes, it is now time to update those gift-giving ideas for Mother's Day. Here are some unconventional ways to honor mom.<ep>
   For the mom who wants a thrill, a flight on a small-engine plane may be the perfect gift.<ep>
   ``We get quite a few calls every year,'' said Alexander Fabio, marketing director at Husta Aviation, located at Opa-locka and Tamiami airports. Its cost: $80.<ep>
   For busy moms who may need a day of pampering, a visit to the spa is a good standard gift.<ep>
   It's called the total Body Fango Spa of Tranquility on Bay Harbor Islands. For $65, workers apply mud from the neck down. After rinsing, workers apply a rich moisturizing cream.<ep>
   ``It's an incredibly rejuvenating and refreshing feeling,'' said receptionist Arleen Lauton. The Mother's Day Special is called the Tranquil Renewal, a two-hour treatment that includes a steam bath with oils, a sea-salt body scrub and a Swedish massage.<ep>
