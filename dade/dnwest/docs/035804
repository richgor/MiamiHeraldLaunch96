<m0>   The administrator of the City of Miami's Neighborhood Enhancement Team Service Center in Overtown is going to have to get physical with 15 moms.<ep>
   On Thursday, the City of Miami NET office hosted a kick-off for Mommy and Me, a fitness and nutrition program that will be open to 15 mothers in the Overtown area. Aerobics classes, which will be headed by Miami Heat dancer Nathalie Joyner, begin June 4.<ep>
   ``Exercise creates a wholesome atmosphere and relieves stress,'' said NET Administrator Miranda Albury, who will participate in the classes. ``Some of our single moms have a lot of stress and we don't want them to take it out on their children.''<ep>
   The program, funded by Eastern Financial Federal Credit Union and the Miami Heat, will last six weeks. Officials presented the NET office with a $1,100 check Thursday. <ep>
   The mothers have children who attend Frederick Douglass Elementary. They will be required to bring their children to class. The sessions will be held at the Culmer Center and will last six weeks. After workouts, the organizers will provide the participants with nutrition tips and a well-balanced meal.<ql>
