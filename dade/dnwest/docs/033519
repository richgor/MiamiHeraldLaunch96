   Palm Springs Elementary has a few published authors (--) some 1,000 of them.<ep>
   Students are writing, rewriting, and illustrating their own stories. And with the touch of binding and laminating machines, the books are published by the school's Palm Lakes Publishing Co.<ep>
   The books are on display from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. today at the first Writers Fair in the school's media center, 7450 W. 16th Ave. There will be a special reception at the school for parents from 5 to 7 p.m.<ep>
   And these young authors aren't at a loss for words. Enrique Perez and Reynaldo Meneses (--) who both recently arrived from Cuba (--) filled nine pages about Reynaldo's four-month stay in a refugee camp at the Guantanamo Naval Base.<ep>
   Reynaldo, 10, told the story in Spanish, and Enrique, 10, wrote it down <m1> <m0>in English.<ep>
   ``When I didn't understand,'' Enrique said, ``I looked in the dictionary.''<ep>
   An illustration of a barbed-wire fence haunts the cover of their book dedicated ``to all good people.'' Between the pages, Reynaldo talks about life behind that fence, showers with only a bucket full of water and the fear of bombs planted to wound escapees.<ep>
   ``I was a little nervous writing about Guantanamo,'' Reynaldo said.<ep>
   The students will take the books home at the end of the year. Teachers select the top stories for a schoolwide anthology published quarterly. They've published three so far this year.<ep>
   ``We are preparing them to be able to communicate in the work world of tomorrow,'' Principal Rosa Calvo said. ``They are learning to be outstanding writers.''<ep>
   Students pick their own topics, which range from the personal to the fanciful.<ep>
   Picture Christian Pacheco's story about Pecky the woodpecker:<ep>
   Pecky broke his beak when he flew into a tree trunk. No problem, Pecky said. He used an electric pencil sharpener to repair it.<ep>
   ``[The idea] just came to me,'' said Christian, 10.<ep>
   Kimberly Cabak's story idea arrived at her house seven months ago. It was her baby brother Christopher, and it was a miracle, Kimberly, 6, wrote.<ep>
   ``He is so cute and he is soft and he likes to play,'' said Kimberly, who won second place in the county's Books With Wings contest.<ep>
   The book surprised her mother, Barbara Cabak.<ep>
   ``I was very touched because those are her true feelings,'' Cabak said. ``And she already wants to be an author.''<ep>
