   The man who shot a repairman twice during a robbery earlier this year is now behind bars, say Metro-Dade police.<P>

   Police arrested Amos Servants, 18, of 6091 NW 15th Ave., Tuesday, but they are still looking for a second man who took part in the robbery that left the victim seriously wounded.<P>

   Servants was charged with armed robbery and attempted first-degree murder.<P>

   Police say at 1:30 p.m. Jan. 4 the victim, a refrigerator repairman, was leaving a home in the 2200 block of Northwest 60th Street after a job, when the robbers approached him, asking him a question to get his attention.<P>

   That's when Servants pulled a gun, police said.<P>

   He and his partner allegedly took the man's wallet, which contained $1, a gold necklace with a miniature St. Lazarus pendant and a tool box. Then Servants shot the man in the neck and the face, leaving him virtually blind in one eye.<P>

   The gunmen fled in a small- to medium-sized red or maroon vehicle.<P>

   The victim was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital. <P>

   ``This is a case where the take is definitely not worth the injury to the victim,'' said Edgar Clark, robbery detective handling the case. ``Last time I spoke to him, he said doctors had little hope for sight out of one eye.''<P>

   Clark said the man, who was apparently shot without any provocation, did not know the robbers. He would not specify how Servants was tracked down.<P>

   ``He was shocked at the investigation that led to his arrest,'' said Clark. ``There's a lot of stuff we don't want to say right now because we are still trying to find out who the second person was.''
