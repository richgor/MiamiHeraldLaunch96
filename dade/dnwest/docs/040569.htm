   Blas Geraldo Acosta's desire to help others almost cost him his life, Hialeah police said Friday after Acosta became the latest victim of robbers who prey travelers to Cuba.<P>

   Acosta was shot Tuesday as he packed his bags to travel to Cuba to see relatives, becoming the fifth Hialeah resident in the past 18 months to be held at gunpoint for money meant for needy relatives on the island.<P>

   He was listed in good condition Friday at Jackson Memorial Hospital.<P>

  Robbery attempts on people about to visit Cuba are not rare in Hialeah, said police spokeswoman Liz Reyes. Once word gets around that someone is Cuba-bound, the traveler is usually besieged with requests from friends, acquaintances and neighbors to carry gifts to their relatives back home.<P>

   Robbers often pretend to bring gifts to gain access to a home, Reyes said.<P>

   Which is what police suspect happened last week. According to reports, two gunmen walked into Acosta's Park Drive home just after midnight and asked him whether he was going to Cuba.<P>

   When he said yes, thinking they wanted him to deliver gifts to their relatives, the men pulled out guns, and demanded money from Acosta and his wife.<P>

   When Acosta refused, a struggle ensued. Then, one of the men shot him in the chest, and the two ran away without money or property.<P>

   The couple's 9-year-old daughter was sleeping in a bedroom at the time of the incident and was not hurt.<P>

   Police said Acosta did not know the men or how they found out about the trip.<P>

   Police say folks traveling to Cuba often store their gifts at home before departure.<P>

   When criminals find out about the trip, it can mean a home invasion were injury is not uncommon.<P>

   The trend is also prevalent in the Haitian community, where North Miami has investigated 24 cases in the past year.<P>

   ``People need to make it as discreet as possible that they are going on a trip,'' said Sam Fadel, the Hialeah detective working on the Acosta case. ``Don't tell the whole world. And don't keep your door open.''
