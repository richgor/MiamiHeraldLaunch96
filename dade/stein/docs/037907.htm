I<BR>
have a mortgage for a residence in a nice, relatively safe and quiet part of town.<P>

   I pay $506 a month.<P>

   Whenever I stop to think that I'm paying less for my own place than many renters pay for apartments -- renters who aren't building up equity and don't have the tax deduction I have -- it almost seems unfair.<P>

   When I consider that I'm paying far less for my own place than many poor people pay for motels that rent by the day or week, it seems almost criminal.<P>

   A story Sunday by Herald reporter Lori Teresa Yearwood put a human face on this perverse anomaly of modern life: When it comes to lodging, the poorer you are, the more you pay. If you're paying day by day for a cheap motel room, your monthly bill will approach $1,000 a month, on average. If you can pay weekly, you might lower your bill to under $800.<P>

   If you can overcome these punitive rates and manage to save enough to cover first and last month's rent on a year-long lease for a decent apartment, you reap a bonus -- rents that can drop under $600 a month.<BR>
Still-lower payments<P>

   And then, if you can continue scrimping and come up with a down payment on a modest house, you can lower your monthly payment still -- and get that federal income tax deduction. Provided, of course, that during all your financial hardship, you somehow kept your job and your good credit rating. <P>

   Lodging expenses are the most unfair aspect of our free-market economy. It belies the myth that the poor simply don't work hard enough -- in fact, the poor have to work harder than middle class people, relatively speaking, just to keep a roof over their heads. <P>

   Look at the numbers another way: The same $1,000 a month paid by the poor for a cheap motel room could support a mortgage, taxes and insurance on a $100,000 home. Kendall mortgage broker Otto Gonzalez Sr., owner of Unifirst Mortgage Corporation, ran a few rough calculations for me. He determined that the difference between living in a cheap motel and living in a six-figure home is about $10,000 -- for closing costs and a 5 percent down payment -- a good credit history, and a reliable income of $43,000 a year. A full-time working couple, each earning about $10 an hour, could qualify.<P>

   It makes the dividing line between the comfortably middle class and the entrapped poor appear not only thin, but downright illogical: A family with nothing pays the same or more for bare-minimum shelter than many modest-middle-class families pay to own their suburban homes. Anyone who argues that this game isn't stacked against the poor is hallucinating.<BR>
Developing strategies<P>

   Our society's institutions used to encourage home ownership. The G.I. Bill helped returning World War II soldiers buy homes. Labor unions -- now widely despised -- helped provide the income stability that allowed people of modest means to secure mortgages. Union membership played a key role in allowing my parents to escape Harlem and Washington Heights in Manhattan for the suburbs.<P>

   I firmly believe that if our society stopped demonizing the poor on the one hand, and patronizing them on the other, we could develop strategies to help many hard-working, sincere people become homeowners. Programs like Habitat for Humanity work, as do plans to convert public housing to private ownership. I'd rather see the government subsidize mortgage down payments instead of rents, as with dubious programs like Section 8. <P>

   There is no downside to helping people become homeowners. Except, perhaps, for the owners of cheap motels, who may have to keep the Vacancy sign lit a little longer.
