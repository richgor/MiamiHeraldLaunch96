<m0>outh Africa's new constitution promises more than it can deliver. But it's the promise that counts most.<ep>
   If the United States were drafting a new constitution today, my guess is the debate would quickly become gridlocked by selfish partisan bickering. Citizens, tired of having the needs of individuals interfere with public policy, would trim or eliminate a host of traditional constitutional protections. Folks with all sorts of agendas would try to embed their political preferences in the new document. Suspicion and cynicism would abound.<ep>
   Yet South Africa, once the world's most notorious bastion of white supremacist oppression, may now be poised to challenge the United States as the world's presumed leader in matters of race relations. The constitution adopted Wednesday does more than bury apartheid (--) it officially states South Africa's consensus vision of an ideal society. <ep>
   The new constitution will eliminate racially apportioned representation in government. Powers are carefully balanced between the federal government and the nation's provinces to assuage fears of the white minority. <ep>
   Most dramatically, the constitution contains an ambitious slate of guaranteed human rights. Americans might find some of them familiar (if not popular) (--) freedoms of speech, movement and political activity, and protections against self-incrimination for the criminally accused. On others, Americans wouldn't likely agree.<ep>
   Imagine a constitutional right to adequate housing, food, water, education and health care. Imagine constitutional bans on discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, age, pregnancy or marital status.<ep>
   South Africa can't make all these things happen. No government can. But by committing society to these worthy goals, maybe the <m0>citizens<m0> can.<ep>
   The United States in the 1950s and '60s faced a similar situation as the last barriers of our apartheid system were dismantled. The social programs instituted back then (--) affirmative action, public housing, Medicaid, school busing, school lunch programs and so on (--) were created to undo some of the institutional wrongs that had been done to black Americans.<ep>
   It was America's attempt to define and move toward its ideal society (--) a place where everyone had enough food, adequate shelter, equal access to health care and educational opportunity, and no impediments to prosperity based on race.<ep>
   Many of the programs failed to deliver as promised. Some were poorly conceived, some were abused, others have outlived their usefulness. But critics who suggest that the programs were wrong-headed from the beginning are mistaken.<ep>
   America 30 years ago needed to make a commitment to justice, freedom and opportunity for all, and to get momentum going in that direction. If an error was committed, it was that its citizens didn't fully embrace the goals and carry the momentum forward. Rather than finding ways to communicate and work together, we've lapsed into a habit of ethnic bickering and blaming.<ep>
   Government can only point the way to goals such as equality and opportunity. The citizenry has to deliver. This is what South Africa faces today. If it is left up to government alone to guarantee the new constitution's itemized rights, its resources will soon be strained to the limit. But if the efforts of government inspire the citizens to <m0>practice <m0>what the constitution preaches, the goal will be achievable.<ep>
   If they learn from our example, they might head off the resurgence in racial tensions we are presently experiencing.<ep>
   If we learn from their example, we'll be reminded that there is far more promise in accord than there is in hostility.<ep>
