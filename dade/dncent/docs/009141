   A new town has risen where once stood only a jungle gym.<ep>
   A kid's town. <ep>
   Pint-sized buildings form an idyllic community at the Trice Day Care Center's new therapeutic playground, 901 NW 54th St. But the mini-schoolhouse, church and post office aren't just for playing hide-and-seek.<ep>
   There kids will learn through play.<ep>
   ``They'll learn what life is supposed to be like,'' said Patricia Seabrook, playground designer. ``Many of them come from dysfunctional families or places where people can't walk to go to the library, the church or the burger bar.''<ep>
   The Day Care Center, founded in 1991 for kids of substance abusers, has expanded to include other neighborhood kids.<ep>
   The playground, part of the South Florida Family Medical Foundation's ``Save the Family'' campaign, was built with the help of the Miami Chamber of Commerce's Leadership Miami class.<ep>
   Residents of Kidstown will take money from the bank and use it to buy groceries at the store. They'll learn about fire safety under the fire station's roof.<ep>
   ``They'll learn how each business and agency is important in a community,'' Seabrook said.<ep>
   Seabrook and others are developing a curriculum for the playground to be marketed nationwide.<ep>
   Teacher Mary Horne already has begun using the outdoor classroom. She <m1> <m0>spent last week playing postmaster, giving each student a package from the playground post office.<ep>
   ``They see things on the playground and assimilate them into their daily lives,'' said Wilma Thompson, center director and mother of student Matthew, 4.<ep>
   Anisha Jenkins, 5, ran straight for the police station. She'd never been to one.<ep>
   ``I saw them on TV,'' she said. ``I love them.''<ep>
   Parent Tony Roberts already has seen a difference in his daughter Portia, 2. Roberts was surprised when Portia announced she knew the difference between a truck and an ambulance.<ep>
   ``The kids are more curious,'' Roberts said. ``I see a different side of them.''<ep>
