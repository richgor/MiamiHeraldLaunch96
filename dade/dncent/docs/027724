   If you were planning on taking mom to El Novillo or Don Gambrino's in Miami Lakes for Mother's Day, you'll have to wait until next year.<ep>
   Neither restaurant will be open for a few months (--) not in time for the busiest day of the year for restaurants.<ep>
    ``Don't rub it in,'' said Rodney Jackman, general manager of El Novillo, a popular Nicaraguan restaurant scheduled to open in late November. ``We hope to open by Father's Day.''<ep>
   Jackman said the opening of the restaurant near Main Street was delayed due to problems with permits. The new target date is June. Once open, it will be the third El Novillo in Dade.<ep>
   ``I would love to go visit them once they're open,'' said Rosemary Vicioso, an agent at Miami Lakes Travel. ``I eat at El Novillo all the time.''<ep>
   Nearby, Don Gambrino's is slated to open in July across from Main Street, just east of Northwest 67th Avenue.<ep>
   The restaurant is named after two major figures: a god of brewers in Ancient Roman mythology (--) Gambrinus (--) and Miami Lakes' most famous businessman, Don Shula. It will make and serve four different types of beers.<ep>
   It was originally scheduled to open by the end of 1994. The opening has been delayed by problems with prior contractors. Construction is nearly complete, said Mario Florez, an assistant to the owner. The eatery will feature a built-in micro-brewery that customers can see through a glass wall.<ql>
