   A knee operation left Elaine Howell unable to walk unaided. But that changed (--) at least temporarily (--) when the Nautilus Middle Jazz Band came to the Opa-locka Neighborhood Center.<ep>
   Big band tunes and a walker helped Howell from her seat. By the end of the song, she was dancing solo.<ep>
   ``I have the rhythm,'' said Howell, 85. ``But until now I didn't have the legs.''<ep>
   The songs were old but it was a youthful spirit that filled the Opa-locka Center on Monday. Students from four Dade schools celebrated Intergenerational Awareness Month and the culmination of a year's worth of sharing and learning from seniors.<ep>
   One Miami Beach High English class wrote biographies of the seniors.<ep>
   Sophomore Delitza Ramirez learned about Jamaica and its Dunn River Falls, but there is one lesson she said she'll take with her:<ep>
   ``Seniors have a lot of experience,'' she said. ``We should listen to them and not take them for granted.''<ep>
   Allie McMillan stood among African queens and kings (--) in a portrait painted by Jackson High students.<ep>
   McMillan, recovering from a stroke, struggled to express her thanks.<ep>
   ``It's beautiful,'' McMillan, 73, said. <ep>
   Scenes performed by New World School of the Arts students had Mable Fulton, 86, howling. Fulton found herself to be a lot like fictional character Lucinda Matlock played by Alexandra Chitty, 16. Both married young, both had more than 10 children, and both loved life.<ep>
   ``I'm old but I enjoyed it,'' Fulton, said.<ql>
