   The neighborhood of Overtown will salute 20 traditional families (--) that's mom, dad and children (--) with a parade. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``We have to salute families right now,'' said Miranda Albury, administrator of the Neighborhood Enhancement Team Service Center in Overtown. ``Because they are the ones in the trenches, providing stabilization for their children and we really appreciate their efforts.''<ep>
   And a little bit of encouragement doesn't hurt, Albury said. Overtown's public school principals, who are in charge of finding the families, agreed.<ep>
   On Monday, they met with Albury to discuss the parade that will be held along Northwest Third Avenue between Ninth and 17th streets. Each school will name five families.<ep>
   Participating schools are Frederick Douglass, Dunbar, Phillis Wheatley elementary schools and Booker T. Washington Middle School.<ep>
   The march, scheduled for 6 p.m. May 31, could serve as encouragement to the families and perhaps help others realize the importance of a stable family environment, organizers said.<ep>
   ``We have the hardest time finding a traditional family in Overtown that is still together,'' said Thirlee Smith, assistant principal at Douglass Elementary, 314 NW 12th St. There, the majority of the students come from single-parent households, he said.<ep>
   ``But the ones who do stay together show that the family unit has a tremendous effect in a child's academic and social life.''<ql>
