   Ron Hextall doesn't buy all this head-to-head matchup business. The Flyers goaltender understands why he and Florida Panthers goalie John Vanbiesbrouck are poster boys for this Eastern Conference semifinal series.<ep>
   Oh, he knows that both goalies are playing <m2><ql>
<m0>their brains out.<ep>
   He just doesn't buy the spotlight.<ep>
   ``It's the Flyers playing the Florida Panthers. It's not me playing Vanbiesbrouck,'' Hextall said Monday as the Flyers prepared for tonight's Game 3 of the best-of-seven series at Miami Arena.<ep>
   Hextall and Vanbiesbrouck (--) make that the Flyers and the Panthers (--) are tied at one victory apiece.<ep>
   ``People try to make it Eric Lindros vs. Mark Messier when we play the Rangers, and it's not like that, either,'' Hextall said. ``It was me against Tampa Bay's Daren Puppa in the first round. It's always goalie against goalie. It's the nature of the position.''<ep>
   But it's not always this goalie against that goalie. Hextall and Vanbiesbrouck are two of the NHL's most-experienced and successful goalies. Both have won Vezina Trophies. Both were coveted by Bob Clarke, the Flyers' general manager, who served as the Florida GM in 1993.<ep>
   And both have been dominating in the playoffs. Hextall is 5-3 with a 2.08 goals-against average and a .911 save percentage. Vanbiesbrouck is 5-2 with a 2.55 goals-against average and a .930 save percentage.<ep>
   Both have allowed just 17 goals.<ep>
   ``Both goalies have been very good in making big stops at key times,'' Flyers Coach Terry Murray said. ``Hexy made some big saves at the end of Game 2 when we were holding a 3-2 lead, and Vanbiesbrouck made some big stops in Game 1.<ep>
   ``Goaltenders are the key people in the series. They always will be.''<ep>
   Hextall has been a key player all season for the Flyers. He won 31 games, the second most of his career, and had a career-low 2.17 goals-against average. He had four shutouts and played more than 3,000 minutes.<ep>
   And he did it all having to adjust to the Flyers' stifling defense. Never before had Hextall seen so few shots in a season, he said.<ep>
   ``It's an adjustment playing in front of such a defensive team,'' Hextall said. ``You don't handle the puck as much, and the pace of the game is different. I've definitely had to change how I play and think a little bit.''<ep>
   Indeed, the Flyers outshot the Panthers, 65-41, in the first two games, and Florida managed to get off more than eight shots in a period only once. Since the Flyers blasted at least 14 shots at Vanbiesbrouck in each of the three periods of Saturday's 3-2 victory in Game 2, the Florida goalie would appear to be under more pressure.<ep>
   Maybe not, Hextall said.<ep>
   ``Players put pressure on themselves,'' he said. ``Our teammates don't pressure us to play differently or better. We know it's a team game. Look at Game 2. Vanbiesbrouck played a great game and lost.''<ep>
