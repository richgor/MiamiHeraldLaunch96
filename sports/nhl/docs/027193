   Sergei Krivokrasov, shifted to the top line after Tony Amonte suffered a third-period injury, scored 46 seconds into overtime Monday night to lift the Chicago Blackhawks to a 4-3 victory over the Colorado Avalanche in Chicago.<ep>
   It was the second overtime victory of the series for Chicago, which trailed, 3-1, late in the second period before getting goals by Joe Murphy and Jeremy Roenick.<ep>
   The Blackhawks, who won the opener, 3-2, on Roenick's overtime goal, can take the best-of-seven series with victories in Chicago on Wednesday and at Colorado on Saturday.<ep>
   Eric Daze came up with a loose puck in Colorado ice and passed into the right faceoff circle to Krivokrasov, who beat Patrick Roy high to the stick side. Krivokrasov had been skating on the fourth line until Amonte, one of Chicago's best players, went out with a leg injury.<ql>
<m0>Report: Ciccone hit officer<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Chicago Blackhawks defenseman <m0>Enrico Ciccone <m0>reportedly struck an off-duty police officer in the face during Saturday night's playoff game with the Colorado Avalanche.<ep>
   Officer <m0>Donald Vecchi, <m0>a homicide detective working a security detail in uniform at the game, did not press charges, police said Sunday. Ciccone narrowly avoided arrest by apologizing, The Rocky Mountain News said today.<ep>
   The incident occurred near the end of the second period, shortly after the Blackhawks enforcer was sent off the ice after receiving a high-sticking minor and 10-minute misconduct.<ep>
   When someone threw popcorn Ciccone, Vecchi hustled Ciccone away from the crowd toward a portable tunnel.<ep>
   ``Ciccone turns as if to pull away, and he hits Vecchi in the mouth with a gloved hand,'' police spokesman <m0>Mark Lewis <m0>said.<ep>
