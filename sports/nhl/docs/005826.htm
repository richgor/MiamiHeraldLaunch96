Blackhawks 4, Avalanche 3, OT<BR>
By MIKE NADEL<BR>
AP Sports Writer<BR>
<P>

   CHICAGO -- (AP) -- Sergei Krivokrasov, shifted to the top line after Tony Amonte suffered a third-period injury, scored 46 seconds into overtime Monday night to lift the Chicago Blackhawks to a 4-3 victory over the Colorado Avalanche.<P>

   It was the second overtime win of the series for Chicago, which trailed 3-1 late in the second period before getting goals by Joe Murphy and Jeremy Roenick.<P>

   The Blackhawks, who won the opener 3-2 on Roenick's overtime goal, can take the best-of-7 series with victories in Chicago on Wednesday and at Colorado on Saturday.<P>

   Eric Daze came up with a loose puck in Colorado ice and passed into the right faceoff circle to Krivokrasov, who beat Patrick Roy high to the stick side. Krivokrasov had been skating on the fourth line until Amonte, one of Chicago's best players, went out with a leg injury with 8:06 left in regulation.<P>

   Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Enrico Ciccone reportedly struck an off-duty police officer in the face during Saturday night's playoff game with the Colorado Avalanche.<P>

   Officer Donald Vecchi, a homicide detective working a security detail in uniform at the game, did not press charges, police said Sunday. Ciccone narrowly avoided arrest by apologizing, The Rocky Mountain News said today.<P>

   The incident occurred near the end of the second period, shortly after the Blackhawks enforcer was sent off the ice after receiving a high-sticking minor and 10-minute misconduct.<P>

   ``As he was coming off the ice, someone threw popcorn at him,'' police spokesman Mark Lewis said.<P>

   Vecchi then hustled Ciccone away from the crowd toward a potable tunnel.<P>

   ``He moves him on down,'' Lewis said. ``As they get into that portable tunnel, Ciccone turns as if to pull away, and he hits Vecchi in the mouth with a gloved hand.''<P>

Gretzky not Great vs. Wings<BR>
<P>

   Injured or not, Wayne Gretzky is hurting the St. Louis Blues in the playoffs.<P>

   Gretzky was on the ice for four of the Detroit Red Wings' five first-period goals in Sunday's 8-3 Game 2 blowout loss. Hockey's career leading scorer, who's negotiating a three-year, $21 million contract, has become a puzzling liability as the Blues have fallen behind, two games to none.<P>

   ``I stink,'' Gretzky said after Game 2. ``It's my responsibility to lead this team, and I consider myself responsible for both these losses.''<P>

   Gretzky leads the NHL with 11 assists in these playoffs. But in eight postseason games, he has yet to add to his career record of 110 playoff goals.<P>

   After the first-period debacle Sunday, he mostly sat alongside the Blues' other big star, Brett Hull, in a game that General Manager-Coach Mike Keenan had written off as a lost cause.
