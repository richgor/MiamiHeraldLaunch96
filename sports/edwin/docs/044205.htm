   LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Guess you want the Kentucky Derby winner. So do I, after three in 16 years. Only this time I am going to offer a bet of the heart instead of what physically passes for a head.<P>

  Unbridled's Song.<P>

  He's the chalk, right. And he still has to whip more problems than any favorite in decades to take it all.<P>

  Since City By Night dropped out Friday morning, Unbridled's Song will be going out of the No. 19 gate instead of the No. 20. That still leaves 18 colts closer to the rail he has to beat to the first turn. Or at least be near the lead.<P>

  This is asking for as much speed as soul, as much maneuverability as persistence. And the horse who is being asked has been fighting a left-hoof injury all week.<P>

  Unbridled's Song looked excellent winning Gulfstream Park's Florida Derby by 5 3/4 lengths over Editor's Note. He will have to be more than excellent to come out of Churchill Downs' first turn in good shape. He will have to be great to make it around that turn near the lead, before some good colts will be starting inside him -- Skip Away, Diligence, and, yes, In Contention.<P>

  Those are my 1-2-3-4 picks, for what they are worth, probably not the computer diskette they're typed on.<P>

  Say this on the positive side: It is past time for a favorite to win, after 16 straight Derby upsets.<P>

  If you tied me to a tall maple tree on the backstretch and threatened to glue my hide with losing parimutuel tickets, I would admit that I not only picked 1979's Spectacular Bid, that last favorite to win, but your Lilliputian agent here also received a sterling silver set from the local newspaper that used to make this award to whomever came closest.<P>

 Had 'em right in order, three beautiful four-legged soldiers in a row, Spectacular Bid first, General Assembly second and Golden Act third.<P>

  I also picked Unbridled ($21.60 for $2) in '90 and Go for Gin ($18.20 for $2) in '94. Nice payoffs, but let's level: Three winners in 17 years doesn't leave you much to put in those sterling silver cups.<P>

  This Derby field is something like that, cluttered up by nags who only muck up traffic for the thoroughbreds that really belong.<P>

  Listing them from the posts farthest inside, these are the colts who would require a minor miracle and at least several other advantageous accidents to hit the board:<P>

  Blow Out, Built for Pleasure, Corker, Halo Sunshine, Honour and Glory, Matty G, Semoran, Victory Speech and Zarb's Magic.<P>

  Back to the real stock, I give Sonny Hine-trained Skip Away a chance because he is coming off a career performance in the Blue Grass.<P>

  Skip Away has to ``bounce,'' as they say -- come back better than most horses do from a sensational race. And he lacks that esoterically-significant ingredient called Dosage Index, which considers horses' supposed hereditary ability to run a mile and a quarter.<P>

  All of them can run a mile and a quarter, don't you see?<P>

  It's just that some take twice as long as others.<P>

  And when you're thinking about Nick Zito-trained Diligence, remember he does have the Dosage.<P>

  On the other hand, Strike the Gold, the '91 champ also trained by Zito, didn't qualify on the Dosage Index.<P>

  Zito has won two of the last five Derbies. I'm beginning to think he is the one with the Dosage.<P>

  Back to Unbridled's Song, he is much the best in this company. But there are even more obstacles than his bruised left heel and that gosh-awful No. 19 post.<P>

  The real hang-up is, the Derby is so often won by not the best horse, or the best trainer, or the best jockey, but merely the combination of the luckiest and the best around 5:32 p. m. at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May.<P>

  It's a crap shoot using four-legged animals instead of six-sided dice. And still the most fabulous two minutes in sports, no matter who wins -- the best, who is Unbridled's Song, or even one of those milkwagon-pullers who doesn't belong here at all.
