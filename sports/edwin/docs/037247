<m1> <m0>s far as I'm concerned (--) and I declaim now from the personally rare position of paying customer (--) <m1> <m0>Panthers fans overriding the national anthem with chants of ``Lindros sucks!'' is worse than basketball's Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf refusing to stand for the anthem.<ep>
   Bad enough to disrespect the anthem passively. Worse to shout it down, especially with that particular shout.<ep>
   Hockey is fun and hockey should be loud, but save a little common decency, OK?<ep>
   It wouldn't hurt, either, if Miami Arena had a decent sound system so you could hear the words out of it as well as you hear those out of the fans.<ep>
   Otherwise, my first Panthers game strictly as a spectator was a gas. In general terms, the crowd was a positive revelation. Phenomena create revelations, and these Panthers have been thoroughly phenomenal by comparison with South Florida's other marquee teams.<ep>
   The Heat started and finished so poorly, any team that plays in the same building would look sensational. Last fall's Dolphins sank like a stone in Buffalo. Today's Marlins can't hit a hippo in the butt with a Greyhound bus.<ep>
   Then there's MacLean the Magnificent.<ep>
   Only Miami Hurricane football coach Butch Davis can measure up to Doug MacLean for the best leadership of any team around here since Dennis Erickson coached the Hurricanes' last national title in 1991.<ep>
   Result: I've never heard anything like these Panthers crowds for per capita noisemaking.<ep>
   A bit of violence plays a part in this. People don't go to hockey games entirely to see violence any more than they go to auto races to see crashes, but it's part of the attraction.<ql>
<m0>Attractive attraction<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  That still doesn't explain how ice hockey turned into a tropical craze, complete with numbingly high numbers of Hispanic fans.<ep>
   Some other things do. The stunning speed on ice. The shattering sound in the stands. The youth and/or vitality of most customers, not excluding the undeniable point that male fans are frequently heard to comment on the winsomeness of female fans, and vice versa. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Hockey is a tough sport for lean folks. Most hockey fans aren't the affluent types so often seen at Heat games, or in the club seats for the Dolphins and Marlins. They are mostly working stiffs who make financial sacrifices for their hockey.<ep>
   I was lucky to be able to buy tickets for myself and my wife, at $40 apiece, even up in the Oxygen Deprivation Zone, Section 237, Row K, Seats 10 and 11.<ep>
   Crank in the parking fee and another $14 or so for two roast-beef sandwiches and two bottles of <m0>water, <m0>yet, and I'm here to depose a night of hockey will stand the average couple at least $100.<ep>
   They wring out their money's worth, all right. Early in Game 3 against the Philadelphia Flyers, I couldn't figure out what was tickling my left ear. When I turned a few degrees to the left I saw it was the tail of the fake rat in the hand of the guy behind me.<ep>
   Again generally speaking, we loved the night from the first sign we saw just off Biscayne Boulevard (--) PARKING $5, FREE RAT (--) up to the point Trent Klatt put the game away early in the third period.<ep>
   The Panthers simply never rose to the level of their cheering fans. Nor, thankfully, did they sink to the level of the fans who dissed the anthem. Or maybe I got it wrong. Maybe those were live rats shouting over the anthem.<ql>
