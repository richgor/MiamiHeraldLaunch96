<m0>w, they're picking on those poor little rich boys again. Jimmy Johnson has barely moved in and the Dolphins are already hollering, ``Excessive contact!''<ep>
   My first question is, what would they consider <m0>reasonable<m0>  contact?<ep>
   Letting Buffalo rush for 341 yards last Dec. 30?<ep>
   Giving up 114 points in successive losses to New England, San Francisco and Indianapolis?<ep>
   Second question: How would most Dolphins know contact well enough to complain about an excess of it in Johnson's early minicamps?<ep>
   Webster's New World Dictionary defines ``contact'' as ``the act or state of touching or meeting.'' Anything beyond touching seems to be excessive to what remains of the 1995 Dolphins defense.<ep>
<m1><styl>cxon<ql>
<m2> <ql>
<m0>   The only three D-men who made enough contact to qualify for the definition were Bryan Cox (who, unfortunately, conversed as much as he contacted), Marco Coleman and Troy Vincent. And they are all gone.<ep>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<m0>   Be sure Johnson will not allow The Excessive Contact Case to become federal. He will chafe until summer camp. Then let anybody beef about the contact that is dead solid certain to be excessive (--) and perfectly legal under union rules (--) and watch them try to climb out of Johnson's doghouse.<ep>
   Salary-cap strictures prevent coaches from simply firing players. That's one reason Don Shula had to keep some people who could have won a Super Bowl going away if they had made contact with opponents as much as they loafed and griped.<ep>
   Keith Byars, for so long a true warrior, spent more time complaining about not enough balls being thrown to him than he did catching those that were. He made contact with a lot of passes. Just didn't maintain it long enough for a completion. You could count on one hand Byars' excessive contacts as a runner.<ep>
   Eric Green didn't so much as bother to make contact with the last practice before the game against his old Pittsburgh teammates. He was, however, reportedly in contact with a night on the town with Steelers buddies.<ep>
   No one accused even the stars of the offensive line, Richmond Webb and Keith Sims, with excessive contact in a season when the line gave up more sacks, 29, than the defense, made, 28.<ep>
   This team couldn't stand up, let alone commit excessive contact. Never has a bunch touted as Super Bowl material spent so much time horizontal when it should have been vertical.<ep>
 <m1><styl>cxon<ql>
<m2> <ql>
<m0>  So-called ballplayers took millions up front and either fell out or dozed off. Some Dolphins spent more time sleeping in meetings than they did when they were supposed to be in bed.<ep>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<m0>   Worse, they were constantly stepping out of meeting rooms to take cellular-phone calls. Probably thought contact meant a phone connection.<ep>
   Otherwise, the most contact any Dolphins were making near the end was colliding with heel-dust from the 49ers, and the Rams' Isaac Bruce and the Bills.<ep>
   I will spare you the customary lecture on spoiled pro athletes today. Some Dolphins never let up. You know who they are.<ep>
   If some of the others want to find out what contact means, they should check out the Florida Panthers. Mention contact to any of the Panthers, and you get a stock answer. ``That's hockey.''<ep>
   Dumb me. I thought that was pro football, too.<ql>
