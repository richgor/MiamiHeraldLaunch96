<styl>    I can think of several places where the talents of football player Christian Peter would fit right in. Coincidentally, all of these places happen to have iron bars for doors. At these places, Mr. Peter still would get to wear a uniform. No helmet, though.<P>

    I can think of 30 other places where this guy should not  be welcome. That's in the NFL.<P>

    A quick backgrounder on our Prince Charming in cleats here.<P>

    Readers of the sports section or police reports may be aware the inaptly named Christian is the sack-of-slime defensive lineman from Nebraska. He's the guy New England drafted in the fifth round last month and <BR>
then released after an outcry by fans.<P>

    Peter's crimes against women have been alleged so often the past five years, by so many different accusers, only his lawyers should have any benefit of doubt left. <P>

    Past or pending, he has been accused of rape, sexual battery and other degradation of females. He is serving 18 months probation on one charge, and awaits sentencing on another. His accusers tell of behavior too vile to repeat here.<P>

    Yet five teams including Kansas City, Seattle and Miami (!) showed initial interest in signing this dirtbag, The Boston Globe has reported. Jimmy Johnson said: ``As of right now, we have no intention of bringing him in'' -- a door left slightly ajar.<P>

    I know how the NFL operates. Teams hope the firestorm will fade. Then, as summer camps approach, one will try to quietly slip him in. There will be nothing quiet about it, though. That team (are you listening, Jimmy?) will sign onto a public relations disaster.<P>

    Peter should be blackballed from the NFL. Not systematically. No, that would bring out the ACLU and the softies like Le Batard over there.<P>

    Yes, the bum you defend has rights, Le Batard. But guess what? So do the teams. Thirty teams, one after the other, have the right to stand up and say Christian Peter is not the sort of human being they wish <BR>
to employ.<P>

    Sports must take a moral, sane stand and judge that all outrageous social behavior is not  forgiven and so tacitly sanctioned because the 40 time is right. I'm not talking about weeding out all but angels. But if sports set a higher standard for civility, maybe the pro athlete wouldn't have the sullied name he does today.<P>

    The notion of sports stars as role models sadly fades as we watch Michael Irvin in a fur coat traipsing a courtroom corridor. But the concept remains noble, worthy of aspiration.<P>

    Good riddance, Christian Peter.
