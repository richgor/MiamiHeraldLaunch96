<H2>Ordo&ntilde;ez's tall order: Be better than Ozzie</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   The bad things about baseball are echoing throughout Joe Robbie Stadium, playing on the giant scoreboard as the Mets take infield. Bud Selig is making some speech in front of a cluster of microphones, but then his image is replaced. An enormous Barry Bonds appears, standing at the plate and admiring his home run like fine art, a picture of his own face painted on each of his orange wristbands.<P>

   Down on the field, coach Rafael Landestoy is hitting hard grounders toward shortstop, crack-crack-crack. Tiny Rey Ordo&ntilde;ez, the remarkable rookie, scoops up each shot as naturally as a baby takes a breath. Over and over, Ordo&ntilde;ez takes the ball and flips it perfectly behind his back to the second baseman. It's like watching a magician practice, with the stadium still empty and the big show still an hour away.<P>

  ``Rey is already as good as Ozzie Smith was in his prime, and the future promises he'll be better,'' Landestoy says, taking another swing.<P>

  Landestoy is Ordo&ntilde;ez's interpreter and chaperon, in charge of protecting a Mets treasure. He is asked for for his favorite aaaah-inspiring Ordo&ntilde;ez play -- everyone in the Mets organization has one -- but he interrupts the question.<P>

   ``You want just one?'' he says, laughing. ``I've got a bunch.''<P>

   This is where baseball's best legends are made, in tales told near a batting cage and in plays that make the diamond sparkle, not on some screaming stadium scoreboard or on packaged commercials asking you to vote Griffey for president. Mets Manager Dallas Green had heard all his minor-league people raving wildly about Ordo&ntilde;ez -- saying the kid was making plays they had never seen anybody  make -- and Green was so skeptical.<P>

   ``But he's every bit as good as advertised,'' Green says. ``All they adjectives they used, you can see why they were searching for words to describe him.''<P>

   Green is asked if Ordo&ntilde;ez has the skills to be the best shortstop ever, and he doesn't even pause.<P>

   ``That's fair,'' he says.<P>

   Ordo&ntilde;ez defected from Cuba in 1993, hopping a fence in Buffalo and jumping into a friend's red Cadillac. He flew to Miami first class, drinking champagne all the way, and has continued his climb into the clouds. Jose Vizcaino was this team's MVP last year, at shortstop. This year, he was told to move to second base.<P>

   ``The plays I make are unprepared,'' Ordo&ntilde;ez says in Spanish. ``The ball comes and I catch it. The play happens too fast for me to realize what I've done. When I see the replay, that's when I say, `Damn, that was a great play.' ''<P>

   Ordo&ntilde;ez, 5-9, 159 pounds, has already had more impact than any other Cuban defector. He came into Wednesday's 4-1 loss to Florida leading the team in hitting at .333, but focusing on Ordo&ntilde;ez's hitting is like talking about Dan Marino's handoffs. He hit .214 at Triple A last year and got promoted anyway.<P>

  Ordo&ntilde;ez, 23, is too young and too unfamiliar with this country's ways to feel the pressures of being the starting shortstop in a city as hostile as New York. The Yankees give Kenny Rogers $20 million and start him in the bullpen, so afraid the New York experience will melt his mind. Ordo&ntilde;ez, who speaks very little English, doesn't understand.<P>

   ``The ball is the same,'' says his father-in-law, Arnaldo Fiallo. ``And the boy has no nerves anyway.''<P>

   Ordo&ntilde;ez doesn't stay at the elegant team hotel. He prefers Fiallo's home in Hialeah, eating his wife's bistec  and arroz con frijoles.  He declined a limo ride the team offered the other day. He preferred Fiallo pick him up at the airport.<P>

   Fiallo's family, seven people strong, watched Ordo&ntilde;ez dive into the hole in Wednesday's second inning, easy as can be, and throw out Charles Johnson by a step. Ordo&ntilde;ez was in short left field when he let go of the ball. It was a play no Marlin shortstop has made, ever. It didn't rank in Ordo&ntilde;ez's Top 10.<P>

   His best major-league play may have been one of his first. On a wet Opening Day, he grabbed a relay throw on the third-base foul line, a 150 feet from home, and threw out quick Royce Clayton at the plate. Ordo&ntilde;ez was on his knees at the time.<P>

   One of the players in the other dugout was stunned.<P>

   ``It's safe to say that he's the second coming of me,'' Ozzie Smith said.
