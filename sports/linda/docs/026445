<m1> <m0>iver Melisa Moses used to worry about her friend Jenny Keim, who was so talented, yet so driven that she seemed headed for that familiar athletic trap where the flame of ambition meets the damper of disgust.<ep>
   Keim pushed her young body to its limits. The second time she suffered a stress fracture in her spine she had to wear a body cast for six months. She underwent shoulder surgery for a growth-plate problem. She tore a ligament in her thumb.<ep>
   Then, at a meet in Australia last fall, she had a harrowing crash, landing on her back off the 10-meter platform. She is still struggling to regain her confidence in what used to be her best event.<ep>
   But Keim kept coming back, more determined. This weekend, as she competes in her home pool at the FINA/Kodak Diving Grand Prix at the International Swimming Hall of Fame, Keim is healthy for the first time in four years and more relaxed than ever. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``Before, she'd be in bed by 9:30 p.m.,'' Moses said. ``Recently she called me at 12:30 a.m. to tell me she'd just gotten home from a great party. I said, `Jenny, aren't you supposed to be in bed?' ''<ep>
  At 17, Keim is finally acting her age.<ep>
  ``Before, diving was her whole life,'' Moses said. ``She never went and did things with friends. Now, diving is part of her life, and being happy is part of her life, too. I don't think she was very happy before.''<ep>
  Keim says the injuries and her boyfriend, Kris Neuschaefer, helped keep her intensity in check.<ep>
   ``I needed more balance,'' she said. ``With the injuries, I feel they were nature's way of telling me to slow down.''<ql>
<m0>Still battling fear<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Keim was seventh after the three-meter springboard semifinals Thursday, which means she advances to Sunday's final. Russia's Vera Ilyina was in first place and teammate Irina Lashko was second, with Moses 20 points behind in third.<ep>
   A healthy Keim showcased her potential at the national meet last month when she was a surprise winner in three-meter, the event she has chosen to concentrate on through the Olympic trials, June 19-23 in Indianapolis. She plans to gradually work herself back up to the platform in a few months.<ep>
   ``I stand up there and feel scared,'' she said. ``I will be able to overcome it, but I'm waiting until I don't have the pressure of the trials to deal with. I'm trying to make it into an experience that has a reason, which is enabling me to improve on springboard.''<ep>
   Keim will be competing in her second Olympic trials. She was 13 when she finished seventh in platform in 1992. Keim's mother, C.J., already has a spot in Atlanta (--) at the scorer's table. Keim will have to finish in the top two to make the U.S. team.<ep>
   ``Ever since I can remember I've wanted to be in the Olympics,'' she said.<ep>
   But as a youngster, her dream was to be an Olympic gymnast.<ql>
<m0>Diving, gymnastics meet<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  By age 7, Keim was on gymnastics Coach Bela Karolyi's Olympic hopefuls team in Houston with Kim Zmeskal and Kristie Phillips, but overtraining resulted in a stress fracture of a vertebra in her lower back. With time off, it healed, but the Karolyis suggested she switch to diving, an acrobatic sport that doesn't subject the spine to so much pounding.<ep>
   ``Bela and Marta knew Jenny was competitive, that she was the type who wanted to go for the gold and would want to stay in sports,'' C.J. said. ``Ironically, she hated water then and she still hates water. She doesn't like being cold.''<ep>
   Keim trained in Texas, then, during a meet in Fort Lauderdale, took a lesson with Ron O'Brien, who invited her to join his team.<ep>
   ``She wanted to train with the best,'' C.J. said. ``The joke was either Ron or China, and we speak better English than Chinese.''<ep>
   A few months later, O'Brien made the 9-year-old Keim the youngest member of his senior team.<ep>
  ``I was very impressed with her attention span at that age,'' O'Brien said.<ep>
  By age 12, she was the youngest diver ever to compete at the senior national meet. She finished 21st in platform.<ep>
  ``She was incredible at such a young age,'' Moses said. ``There was a lot of pressure on her back then.''<ql>
<m0>Injury after injury after injury<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  The injuries soon came in frustrating succession. Keim re-fractured her back and had to wear the collarbone-to-thigh cast.<ep>
  ``It was so hot,'' Keim said. ``When it came off, I couldn't even bend over.''<ep>
  Then came shoulder surgery. Then the thumb. During the past four years, Keim estimates she has missed two years' worth of training.<ep>
  ``The injuries have held her back,'' O'Brien said. ``She'd be much farther along now, especially in platform. Her persistence is her biggest asset.''<ep>
  Keim said quitting never crossed her mind.<ep>
  ``I love it too much,'' she said.<ep>
  O'Brien may have found his match in intensity with Keim.<ep>
  ``For the first seven years, they didn't talk much. They're both very competitive and analytical,'' C.J. said. ``He takes things apart piece by piece and she likes looking at a problem that way.''<ql>
<m0>Serious Keim very present<ep>
<m0>  When O'Brien suggested Keim begin a home-schooling program in the third grade so she would have the flexibility to practice twice a day, she and her parents agreed. C.J., a former teacher, set up the curriculum until two years ago when Keim began taking high-school correspondence courses from the University of Nebraska. She says she doesn't miss going to St. Thomas Aquinas High, which she attended briefly when she was injured.<ep>
   ``It was kind of frustrating and boring,'' she said. ``It took half the class for everybody to sit down. Nobody had the same goals or interests I had.''<ep>
  That's the serious Keim talking, the same one who (--) even though she's the youngest American competing in the FINA/Kodak meet (--) says: ``I'm not really one of the young ones because I've been around so long.''<ep>
  Sometimes she has to remind herself she's only 17.<ep>
  ``I stop and realize that I'm still young,'' she said. ``I have so much time and so much ahead of me.''<ql>
