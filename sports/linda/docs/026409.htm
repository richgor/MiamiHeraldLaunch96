<BR>
<P>

  B<BR>
rian Blades threw himself on the mercy of the court Tuesday, and took responsibility for accidentally shooting to death his beloved cousin, Charles Blades, last year after a joyous Fourth of July family cookout turned into a drunken family argument.<P>

   Immediately after Charles Blades died from a pistol shot to the head, Brian refused to talk to police, which was good legal strategy, but bad public relations. It looked like he was eluding the law the way he eludes defensive backs on a football field.<BR>
 <BR>
<P>

   Pleading no contest to manslaughter spares the family the agony of a trial and shows Brian is accepting blame for his carelessness on that night, when, after hours of heavy drinking, his first reaction in trying to resolve a fight between his brother Bennie and Bennie's ex-girlfriend was to grab a gun. These were not strangers, not thugs, yet Brian ran for his gun.<BR>
<P>

   On May 28, Brian's supporters will try to persuade a judge to keep Blades out of prison, though state guidelines recommend a sentence of at least five years nine months. Family members, including Charles' wheelchair-bound mother, undoubtedly will be there, and maybe former University of Miami teammates, current Seattle Seahawks teammates, Jimmy Johnson and Dennis Erickson -- who could be flying back here again to deal with tragedy, first for the funeral of Marlin Barnes and next for the sentencing of Blades.<P>

   Judge Susan Lebow has the difficult task of deciding how to punish Blades. Prosecutors will ask for prison time, and Blades probably deserves some -- months, not years. Lebow can put Blades on probation, order him to perform community service, attend anger control classes. Let's hope the judge, nicknamed ``Let 'Em Go Lebow'' for her record of leniency, won't be blinded by athletic celebrity.<P>

   Let's hope Lebow doesn't ask Blades to sign her gavel. A California judge asked for Barry Bonds' autograph after he reduced Bonds' alimony payments. A court employee in Texas asked for Michael Irvin's autograph. Deion Sanders and Dennis Rodman signed for jurors after not guilty verdicts. The Rams helped pay Darryl Henley's bail in his cocaine-trafficking case so he could travel to games. Don't get me started on the O.J. Simpson jury.<P>

   An athlete learns early that the rules are different if you're a star -- a grade changed here, rude behavior overlooked there. Athletes must learn there are consequences. In two lawsuits settled out of court in 1989, women accused Brian Blades of violent abuse. In 1991, he was arrested for drunk driving, later reduced to negligent driving. Charles Blades was the peacemaker that July night when he struggled to get the gun away from his drunk and violent cousin. Nothing would cheapen Charles' memory more than if the judge fails to hand down an appropriate sentence.<P>

   The Seahawks and the NFL also have the power to send a message, a message athletes rarely hear: You err, you sit. You drive drunk, you sit. You beat your wife, you sit. Don't expect Erickson to penalize Blades. UM's Frank Costa didn't miss a game even though he was convicted of drunk driving.<P>

   Although Brian has suffered greatly, his career hasn't been interrupted. Charles is dead.
