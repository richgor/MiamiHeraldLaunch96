<m0>  The Marlins have one of the best double-play combinations in the minors at Triple A Charlotte, home to flashy shortstop <m0>Edgar Renteria <m0>and smooth second baseman <m0>Ralph Milliard<m0>.<ep>
  The Marlins expected that. The hitting has been a bonus.<ep>
  After a horrendous start, Milliard is hitting .342 with a home run. Renteria is hitting .324 with two <m4>  <m2><ql>
<m0>home runs and five doubles.<ep>
  ``Those two have really hit the ball with authority,'' said <m0>John Boles, <m0>Marlins vice president of player development. ``Everyone knows about their defense. Now maybe people know about their offense.''<ep>
  What a relief for the Marlins. Neither Renteria nor Milliard hit above .095 this spring in major-league camp before being sent down.<ql>
<m1>Patience, please<ql>

<m0>  <m0>Livan Hernandez, <m0>0-3 with a 12.08 ERA and 11 walks in 12 2/3 innings at Charlotte, is proving to be more human than hero. The Marlins hope you will bear with him.<ep>
  ``When I see Livan I see a 21-year-old kid with a great arm but needing development,'' Boles said. ``The key is patience. It's hard for him, being under a microscope.<ep>
  ``He needs to get better command of his pitches. He's pitching behind to a lot of batters.''<ql>

<m0>  The Marlins were player-friendly with their treatment of Charlotte closer <m0>Mario Brito<m0>. They could have kept Brito, who had four saves and a 1.80 ERA when they sold him earlier this week to a Japanese club, as insurance in case of catastrophe to their major-league bullpen. Or they could have dealt him to another club's Triple A team for a prospect or cash.<ep>
  Instead, they asked if he would like to be sold to the Tokyo Giants, where he could make a six-figure salary. Brito accepted, replacing struggling American <m0>Jeff Manto. <m0>Everyone's happy. And players around the league undoubtedly will remember.<ep>
  Brito's last act at Charlotte, by the way, was winning a game with a three-run home run.<ep>
  (box) The Marlins replaced Brito with reliever <m0>Euclides Rojas. <m0>With road roommates Hernandez and Rojas, Charlotte now leads the International League in Cuban defectors.<ep>
  Charlotte also activated 1993 Organization Pitcher of the Year <m0>Vic Darensbourg <m0>and is trying to acquire another reliever.<ep>

  <m0>(box) Single A Kane County: <m0>RHP <m0>Vic Hurtado <m0>(2-0, 2.16), 2B <m0>Amaury Garcia <m0>(.333, 7 extra-base hits, 5 steals), 3B <m0>Josh Booty <m0>(.164, 8 RBI), OF <m0>Jaime Jones <m0>(.179, 2 HRs), 1B <m0>Nate Rolison <m0>(.317, 3 HRs).<ep>
