  PITTSBURGH -- On a day when Quilvio Veras felt like running, he was able to walk around the bases.<P>

  And so it goes for the Marlins and their great search for scoring runs in 1996.<P>

  Manager Rene Lachemann carved into his batting order, shifting Gary Sheffield to the cleanup spot, moving Jeff Conine to No. 3 and dropping <BR>
Kurt Abbott from second to sixth in effort to find a way to score.<P>

  Then those players and the rest of the Marlins watched as Veras, the leadoff hitter and smallest starter in the lineup, belted a three-run homer to help lift Florida to a 4-1 victory Thursday afternoon over Pittsburgh.<P>

  ``The way we're going, that's a big three-run home run,'' said Lachemann, who has watched the Marlins lead the majors in failing to score. The Marlins, who climbed to 9-14, have scored just 66 runs in 23 games.<P>

  ``When I got to the dugout, everyone said, `where did the power come from,' '' said Veras, who hit a John Hope fastball the other way with two outs in the fifth to give Florida a 4-0 lead.<P>

  ``He showed me something,'' said Sheffield of Veras. ``I didn't know he had that kind of strength.''<P>

  But don't talk to Veras, who led the majors with 56 steals last season, about power. He would rather talk about the two stolen bases he picked up Thursday.<P>

  ``I feel better about the stolen bases than the home run,'' said Veras, who hadn't stolen a base since the third game of the season. He had been thrown out six consecutive times when he stole second base in the first inning. The stolen base helped produce a run when Veras scored on Conine's sacrifice fly to center.<P>

  ``I felt better today than I have all year,'' said Veras, who has been bothered by a hamstring injury. ``I'm not 100 percent yet, but I'm close. I'm looking forward to going to San Francisco and seeing how my leg feels in the cold.''<P>

  The Marlins, who open a three-game series in San Francisco today, not only snapped a three-game losing streak, but they broke a seven-game losing streak dating back to May 23, 1995 at Three Rivers Stadium, where only 8,315 showed up on an overcast Thursday afternoon.<P>

  Al Leiter didn't know about all the bad times in Pittsburgh, where the Marlins are 4-15 against a franchise that has struggled against just about everyone else.<P>

  ``Maybe not knowing helps,'' said Leiter, who once again gave the Marlins just what they needed by pitching 7 2/3 scoreless innings. He left the game after walking two in the eighth and throwing 129 pitches. He gave up just four hits, but walked seven.<P>

  But Leiter (4-1) owns Pittsburgh. He has given up just one earned run to the Pirates in two starts, and has held Pittsburgh to a .166 batting average.<P>

  No one is calling Leiter the ``stopper'' on this club, but Leiter he has won four of the Marlins nine games, and his ERA dropped down to 2.16 Thursday.<P>

  ``I don't feel that way,'' said Leiter of being the stopper. ``I'm 1/25th of this baseball club. I'm just trying to do my job.<P>

  ``I'm just trying to focus on making each pitch. [Pitching coach] Larry Rothschild has really helped me with that. We talked a lot about doing that, and we were talking about it doing it after the innings today. That's the thing I'm doing better this year, staying focused and reducing the game down to one pitch at a time.''<P>

  Many of those pitches were in on the Pirates as Leiter used his slider more Thursday than usual and constantly jammed Pirate right-handers with it. But when Leiter walked right-handers Jay Bell and John Wehner in the eighth, Lachemann went to his closer Robb Nen, who picked up his third save.<P>

  ``That's (129) a lot of pitches,'' Lachemann said. ``I know its a shutout and everything, but I wasn't going to see that third run (reach base). Robb came in and did a good job.''<P>

  The runs are still hard to come by for he Marlins. Just ask Conine who ripped a liner over Al Martin's head in left field with two outs and the bases loaded in the seventh. It looked like the ball would hit the base of the wall, but Martin threw up his glove at the last second and somehow made the catch.<P>

  Sheffield almost brought in another run when he doubled and stole third in the eighth. The Marlins had a play on to send Sheffield on contact, and when Abbott tapped he ball in front of the plate, Sheffield stormed home. Pirates reliever Francisco Cordova made a bare-hand pickup and shoved the ball in one motion to get Sheffield, who ran straight up bumping catcher Jason Kendall, who hung onto the ball.<P>

  The Marlins also had a big opportunity in the first inning when Veras and Joe Orsulak walked on 10 pitches. Conine drove in Veras and Orsulak ran to third when Hope's pickoff throw sailed wild. Sheffield lifted a fly ball to right, and Orlando Merced's throw beat Orsulak to the plate.<P>

  Still the Marlins had a 1-0 lead, and that was enough for Leiter until Veras went upstairs and strolled around the bases.''<BR>
