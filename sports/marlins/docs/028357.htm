  SAN FRANCISCO -- Left fielder Jeff Conine sat out Saturday's game and will also rest today. But Conine, an All-Star MVP who has struggled this season, needs more than a couple days off.<P>

  He needs new contacts.<P>

  Or at least a way to solve a problem he is having with his contacts.<P>

  ``They have always bugged me,'' said Conine, who has been wearing them for nine years. ``But it seems to be a lot worse this year.''<P>

  Conine will visit the Marlins team eye doctor Monday when he returns to South Florida. The main problem is that Conine's eyes become dry and he has trouble seeing. Conine has also had trouble with his contacts fogging up.<P>

  ``You just try to blink them clean,'' Conine said. ``We just feel we need to do something.''<BR>
Andre Dawson started in place of Conine in left field and hit in the No. 3 spot as Gary Sheffield remained in his new role as the Marlins cleanup hitter.<P>

<P>

  Conine is hitting .230 with just one home run and 10 RBI, and he has struck out 25 times in 24 games (87 at-bats).<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  Good is a relative term. Just ask Kevin Brown, who, after throwing a seven-hit, 3-0 shutout against the Giants Friday night, said he didn't have his good stuff.<P>

  ``I think I did a good job of thinking my way through and making good pitches,'' said Brown, who did not allow a runner to reach second base. ``I didn't feel like I overpowered anybody.''<P>

  Brown also had a problem with the mound.<P>

  The mound ``felt funny,'' Brown said. ``There was a big hole in it. I didn't like it at all, but I just had to adjust.''<P>

  Brown said he didn't know if Osvaldo Fernandez, who suffered his first loss Friday, had put the hole there. ``He may like that hole,'' Brown said.<P>

  Brown has not allowed a run in 17 innings against the Giants this season. He pitched eight shutout innings against San Francisco April 6, then left and did not get a decision as the Marlins won, 1-0, on Terry Pendleton's 10th inning home run. San Francisco has been shut out twice this season, both times by Brown, who had help from Robb Nen in the 10-inning game.<P>

  The Giants managed only seven singles (two were infield singles), and Brown allowed only one walk while striking out seven. Catcher Charles Johnson threw out two runners, and Brown had some help with two double plays.<P>

  ``That was an outstanding performance by Brown,'' said Marlins Manager Rene Lachemann. ``The Giants are one of the best offensive teams. They are dangerous.''<P>

  Brown pitched his first shutout in the National League. And when Gary Sheffield hit his 11th homer of the year, a two-run shot in the first inning, Brown had his first lead as a Marlin.<P>

  Someone asked Brown how it felt to have the lead, and he smiled and said: ``It would be my choice.<P>

  ``If we score a few runs in the first inning, I'll take my chances. But I didn't approach it any differently. You still try to get every batter out. That doesn't change. But it was nice in the ninth inning to have a 3-0 lead with [Barry] Bonds and [Matt] Williams coming up. You know they can't hit a three-run homer.''<P>

  Bonds (0 for 7) and Williams (2 for 6) are hitting a combined .153 off Brown without an extra-base hit. ``Shhh,'' said Brown. ``Don't tell anybody that.''<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  Marlins hitting coach Jose Morales missed Saturday's game to have some tests done at Peninsula Hospital. Morales had experienced dizziness and pain in his chest Friday. The tests were negative, and Morales returned to the club after the game, saying he was fine.<P>

<P>

  <LI> The 15,711 fans who witnessed Bonds' 300th home run Saturday won free tickets to a future Giants game as part of a promotion.<P>

<P>

  <LI> Sheffield's home run in the first inning Friday tied the major-league record for homers in April. Willie Stargell, Graig Nettles and Mike Schmidt also hit 11 home runs in April.<P>

   If Sheffield could keep up his incredible home run production, he would be on pace to shatter the single-season homer record of 61 by Roger Maris. Sheffield is on pace to hit 74 in 162 games.<P>

<P>

  <LI> Devon White, who hasn't started in the past nine games because of a hamstring injury, started in center field and hit in the No. 2 spot. He went 0 for 4 and scored a run.<BR>
<BR>
