  Dave Weathers is throwing harder in the bullpen than he did as a starter.<P>

  ``He was throwing 94 and maybe 95 Sunday night,'' Marlins Manager Rene Lachhemann said. ``I don't think I've ever seen him throw that hard.''<P>

  Weathers, 0-0 with a 4.50 ERA in seven relief appearances, said it's because of his limited work.<P>

  ``My arm is stronger,'' he said. ``I used to get a lot more innings, but it's a different role out of the bullpen. I don't think about it being a role. I just think about getting outs.''<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  The Marlins completed a deal Monday, selling the rights of relief pitcher Mario Brito to the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants.<P>

   Brito signed with Florida as a free agent this spring, but did not make the major-league roster and was sent to Triple A Charlotte. The Marlins had no plans to bring Brito to the majors and gave him the option of going to Japan. Brito pitched for the Taiwan Brother Elephants last season.<BR>
<BR>

  CF Devon White, who has been nursing an injured hamstring, said he might be back in the lineup any day. But he added he doesn't want to rush anything.<P>

   ``It feels better,'' White said. ``It's a matter of getting it to where I don't have to come out of the lineup again.<P>

   ``You just want to get it right. A hamstring is always like that. When you think it's ready, it's not.''<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  The Marlins won't talk about Kevin Brown's retaliation pitch in Sunday night's game against the Dodgers, but they don't have to say anything -- it's obvious.<P>

   Brown made some friends on the Marlins when he threw a pitch at Dodgers pitcher Pedro Astacio's head. Astacio hit Greg Colbrunn in the helmet in the second inning. When Astacio came up in the third, Brown threw a high fastball behind his head.<P>

  Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda was furious and asked the umpires to eject Brown. But Brown remained and won his first game in the National League.<P>

  Los Angeles' Brett Butler said he understood why Brown threw at Astacio. <P>

  ``If I as a hitter got hit, and my pitcher didn't protect me, then there's something wrong with that,'' Butler said. ``That's what Brown did. I guarantee you his teammates feel better about Brown today than they did before the game simply for the fact that he did his job.''<BR>
<P>

  <LI> Colbrunn, who left Sunday's game with a headache, felt fine and started Monday. He got a little tired of telling every reporter in South Florida he was OK.<P>

   ``I'm fine,'' he shouted. ``My head is fine. My head is fine.''<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  Marlins reliever Alejandro Pe&ntilde;a's career is in jeopardy because of a shoulder injury similar to one he suffered more than a decade ago.<P>

   Pe&ntilde;a, 36, plans to see Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., Monday for a second opinion on the rotator cuff tear discovered by the Marlins last week. Pe&ntilde;a missed most of two seasons after undergoing rotator cuff surgery in 1985, but returned to pitch in three World Series.<P>

   ``I proved everybody wrong the last time,'' said Pe&ntilde;a, who signed a two-year deal with the Marlins last winter. ``Maybe I'll do it again.''<P>

   Pe&ntilde;a, who in 1993 suffered an elbow injury that sidelined him for two years, had his career resurrected last summer by the Marlins. General Manager Dave Dombrowski signed him to a minor league deal after he had been released by the Red Sox.<P>

   Pe&ntilde;a was 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA in 13 appearances with the Marlins before the Braves, seeking bullpen help on their way to the World Series, acquired Pe&ntilde;a just before the Aug. 31 trading deadline.<P>

   For the Braves, Pe&ntilde;a went 2-1 with a 1.29 ERA in eight postseason appearances. Dombrowski then signed Pe&ntilde;a to a new deal in December.<P>

   Pe&ntilde;a has pitched only four innings this season.<P>

<P>

  <LI> The Marlins won't face the best hitter in baseball this week. Tony Gwynn is in San Diego with an inflamed bursa sac in his right heel, and will join the Padres when they return home Wednesday.<BR>
