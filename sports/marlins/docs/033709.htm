  DENVER -- Happy birthday, Lach!<P>

   Rene Lachemann turned 51 Saturday, then aged about 10 years on the longest day in Marlins history.<P>

   ``Anyone who thinks this is a birthday present is one sadistic [person],'' Lachemann said after watching his Marlins get rocked, 17-5, by Colorado in front of a sellout crowd of 50,052 at Coors Field.<P>

   ``We got the bleep knocked out of us. This is the low point of the season so far. This is the worst. We will see what kind of character we have. We'll see if we can get off the floor from this.''<P>

  The floor was cold and hard as granite Saturday: Starter Chris Hammond never even saw the second inning, but he did see three home run balls sail into the seats.<P>

   After the game, the Marlins moved Hammond and his 10.88 earned-run average to the bullpen.<P>

  And by the time the afternoon sun was setting over the Rockies, Florida had seen club records set in three categories: Runs allowed in a game: 17; Hits allowed in a game: 21; Runs allowed in an inning: seven. The Marlins also gave up five home runs, which tied a club record.<P>

  But the real record that hurts is the one the Marlins are carrying after Saturday's beating. The Marlins are 11-20, and the need to turn things around is becoming more and more pressing.<P>

  ``It's not easy to watch,'' said Marlins President Don Smiley, on his first road trip of the season. ``It's not easy for our players. It's not easy for Lach. I know it sounds routine, but we've got to turn it around. We will see what we are made of. This is a better ballclub than what we have shown. But sooner or later, we have to put up some results.''<P>

  Smiley said no one in the organization has talked about replacing Lachemann as the manager.<P>

  ``I've talked with [General Manager] Dave Dombrowski about a lot of things,'' Smiley said. ``But we have not spoken about that subject. It's way too early to panic. It's too early to lose faith. We just have to get it turned around.''<P>

   Florida used six pitchers, including Robb Nen, who mopped up by pitching the eighth on a day when the only thing worth saving was a little face.<P>

  Hammond gave up home runs to the first two batters he faced (Eric Young and Ellis Burks), walked Dante Bichette on five pitches and then gave up a home run to Larry Walker, who was hitting .538 off Hammond before  he stepped to the plate. It was 4-0, but even Lachemann wasn't worried at that point.<P>

  ``In this place, four runs is nothing to me,'' Lachemann said. ``If we get out of there at 4-0, it's four runs, but the game is not over by any means.''<P>

  But Hammond, who gave up nine runs in one inning in his previous start, couldn't stop the bleeding. He came back and struck out Andres Galarraga -- who came back to hit two three-run homers -- and Vinny Castilla, but he couldn't get the third out. Jayhawk Owens singled and Walt Weiss walked. Then pitcher Marvin Freeman hit a grounder to short. Kurt Abbott went to his right and threw off-balance. Abbott's throw was as ugly as the final score, sailing high over a leaping Greg Colbrunn and into the dugout. That was all for Hammond. Dave Weathers entered and Young hit his  first pitch for a double and it was 7-0.<P>

  ``I am very embarrassed,'' said Gary Sheffield, who started despite having a sore shoulder from diving after a ball Friday night. ``You can't go through the motions. It's time for us to do something. After 31 games, we should be getting better, and it seems we are getting worse. We have the same lineup as last year. We have to produce. It's not the manager's fault. Lach can't hit for us. He can't pitch for us.''<P>

   Jeff Conine, who has been in a slump and bothered by a dry-eye irritation, once again hit well in Colorado: a three-for-three afternoon and his second homer in two days. But he was a lone bright spot. The Marlins hit three home runs, but they were all solos and the team managed just five runs.<P>

  ``These are the nightmares of a manager about playing in this ballpark,'' Lachemann said. ``They turned out to be real life today. I'll live through it. We have to come back, come back fighting.''
