<H2>Perez: Save the savior talk</H2>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Ex-Reds manager backs Lach</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->

   Before the Marlins took off on their recent winning streak, Tony Perez heard his name mentioned as a replacement for Manager Rene Lachemann, and he cringed. He heard the local talk radio shows -- especially the Spanish ones -- saying he could be the Marlins' savior, and he wished the hosts and callers knew this:<P>

  Perez doesn't want to manage again.<P>

  He didn't want to manage the first time. He said he never asked to be named manager of the Reds before the 1993 season. The Reds told him the job was his, so Perez took it. He figured since the club wanted it, and the community wanted it, it must be right.<P>

  It was wrong. After a 20-24 start, one of the most popular members of the 1970s Big Red Machine was removed from a job he never wanted, replaced by Davey Johnson.<P>

  ``Even before that, when I was a coach, I never wanted to be a manager,'' says Perez, with third-base coach Cookie Rojas and superscout Whitey Lockman one of three ex-managers on the Marlins' <BR>
payroll. ``And when I did it, I never liked being the manager. I don't want to do it again.''<P>

  Now Perez finds himself in at least half the situation he was in at Cincinnati, when the team and fans beckoned for him. Many in the Marlins' Hispanic following called for Perez to replace Lachemann after the team's 11-21 start.<P>

  ``I hear things in the community,'' Perez said. ``Most of it is coming from the Spanish fans. They would like to see a Spanish manager, I guess. I don't understand it. Lach does a great job.''<P>

  Marlins officials say Lachemann's job never has been in jeopardy. Coming from an organization that stresses loyalty as strongly as any armed forces unit, what else would you expect them to say? That the team is one loss, five losses -- whatever -- away from major changes? Of course not.<P>

   A Marlins official saying Lachemann isn't in trouble isn't terribly surprising; it is absolutely the loyal thing to do, the right thing to say.<P>

  Like most people -- maybe all -- in the organization, Perez believes the Marlins' poor start isn't Lachemann's fault. He doesn't make horrible decisions from the bench. He doesn't come to work unprepared. He gets respect from players. But scapegoats being what they are, many Marlins fans want to see one sacrificed, and not the actual starting nine that has scored so few runs.<P>

  They want a new manager.<P>

  Perez.<P>

  Tony Perez is a friend of Lachemann's and doesn't like talking about his friend's future. And he wants no part of the speculation.<P>

  ``I already have a job,'' says Perez, the Marlins' director of international relations and special assistant to the general manager. ``I like my job. I don't want to change anything.''<BR>
Three whoppers<P>

  What is it about baseball that begets rumors like ponds beget mosquitoes?<P>

  Three dandies regarding the Marlins briefly circulated this week. I'll save the best for last, and tell you first that the local media was atwitter over word the Marlins were considering trading pitcher John Burkett for Reds left-hander Pete Schourek. Make that, sore-armed left-hander Pete Schourek. No truth to it, of course. ``I haven't spoken with [Reds GM] Jim Bowden since spring training,'' Marlins GM Dave Dombrowski said.<P>

  Before the main course, cleanse your palate with this one: The Expos tried to trade .342-hitting SS Mark Grudzielanek last year for Terry Pendleton. No truth to that rumor. The Marlins say the Expos wanted Pendleton, but weren't offering Grudzielanek.<P>

   And now the entree: The Marlins were trying their best -- are you sitting down? -- to press acting commissioner Bud Selig into reinstating hit king Pete Rose. Why? Maybe so Rose could manage or serve as hitting coach for the Marlins, although no one really knows. No truth to that one, either.<P>

  ``Where do these things come from?'' an incredulous, and amused, Dombrowski wanted to know.<P>

  Where it usually does: The overzealous media looking for a scoop. Not The Herald, mind you. Never The Herald. (We interrupt this column to track down a tip that Wayne Huizenga is courting a replacement for Lachemann. Some guy named Shula.)
