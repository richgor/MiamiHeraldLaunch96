  SAN FRANCISCO -- Barry Bonds stepped over the Florida Marlins and into baseball history Saturday, becoming only the fourth player to hit 300 home runs and steal 300 bases.<P>

  Then Bonds, who homered twice in San Francisco's 6-3 victory over the Marlins at 3Com Park, spoiled his own celebration when he was tossed from the game in the sixth inning.<P>

  Bonds ruined his own party when he wouldn't stop arguing with plate umpire Mark Hirschbeck, who called Bonds out on strikes in the sixth inning. Bonds, who did not swing at a pitch, was upset over the first called strike on the inside and said something to Hirschbeck.<P>

   Bonds took strike two outside, and when he was called out on a 2-2 Joel Adamson inside pitch, he tossed his bat. Bonds was so upset he shoved teammate Marvin Benard out of the way to yell at Hirschbeck. Hirschbeck told Bonds at least twice to just go to left field, and waved him off, but Bonds kept talking as he walked away, and finally Hirschbeck sent him home.<P>

  Afterward, Bonds, who said he didn't think the 300-300 would come so fast, apologized for his conduct.<P>

  ``It was my fault,'' he said. ``It was a good call. I looked at the tape and it was a strike. I went to the umpire's room and I apologized to him.''<P>

  Three members of the 300-300 club were on the field Saturday. Willie Mays was the only one missing. Bobby Bonds is a coach with the Giants, and of course, Andre Dawson, who started Saturday, plays for Florida.<P>

  ``My time came a long time ago,'' said Dawson, 41. ``There was a lot made of it, because it had only been done twice. [Bonds] has unbelievable talent. He can be as good as he wants to be. It's just how much he's willing to push himself, how far he is willing to go.''<P>

  Bonds hit the ball hard enough to scare any team Saturday, but nothing scared the Marlins as much as watching Gary Sheffield, their own franchise player, go down with what appeared to be a serious injury.<P>

  Sheffield snapped his left wrist while making a play in right field in the seventh inning, but stayed in the game and will start today. He did jam his wrist and thumb, but nothing was broken.<P>

  ``At first, I thought he broke his wrist,'' said Marlins Manager Rene Lachemann, who ran out to right field after the play. ``He doesn't go down unless he is in pain.''<P>

  Sheffield joked afterward about feeling 37 years old.<P>

  ``Yeah, 37. That's how old I feel. I've never had this much ice on,'' he said, standing with his wrist wrapped and his hamstrings wrapped. Sheffield has had tightness in his hamstrings over the past two games.<P>

  Here's what happened: Mark Carreon's liner sliced away from Sheffield, who made a lunging stab at the ball. He caught the ball on one hop, but his momentum sent him sliding on the turf, and as he went sliding and digging up a huge divot, his left wrist went behind him, bending backward. The entire Marlins team on the field went out to right field along with Lachemann and the team's two trainers.<P>

  ``It scared me,'' said Sheffield, who hit in the ninth and doubled. ``At first I didn't have any feeling in my thumb. I was just sitting there praying about it. After a while the feeling came back. The turf is different. In the past it was thick grass, but it's different now. I caught my foot in the grass and my feet just went under me.''<P>

  The new grass is Bermuda grass and was installed this year.<P>

  The turf may be different, but the Giants do have one constant: Mark Leiter, who once again pitched his best against the Marlins. Leiter was knocked out in the fifth inning in his previous start. He was gone in the third inning before that, and has gone more than six innings only twice this season -- both times against Florida. He pitched nine shutout innings against Florida April 6.<P>

  Leiter retired the first 13 Marlins Saturday and danced with a perfect game until Terry Pendleton spoiled the perfection, no-hitter and shutout with one out in the fifth, launching a home run into the upper deck in right field. It was Pendleton's second home run of the season -- both have come against the Giants.<P>

  John Burkett, who once had the same kind of success against his former teammates (he had a 15-inning scoreless inning streak against the Giants last year), ran into trouble early, then ran into Bonds. They were good friends as teammates.<P>

  Bonds ``will be the first to get 400 and 400,'' said Burkett. ``Then everybody will forget today. But I won't.''<BR>
