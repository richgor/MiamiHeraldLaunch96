  The Marlins have one of the best double-play combinations in the minors at Triple A Charlotte, home to flashy shortstop Edgar Renteria and smooth second baseman Ralph Milliard.<P>

  The Marlins expected that. The hitting has been a bonus.<P>

  After a horrendous start, Milliard is hitting .342 with a home run. Renteria is hitting .324 with two <BR>
home runs and five doubles.<P>

  ``Those two have really hit the ball with authority,'' said John Boles, Marlins vice president of player development. ``Everyone knows about their defense. Now maybe people know about their offense.''<P>

  What a relief for the Marlins. Neither Renteria nor Milliard hit above .095 this spring in major-league camp before being sent down.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  Livan Hernandez, 0-3 with a 12.08 ERA and 11 walks in 12 2/3 innings at Charlotte, is proving to be more human than hero. The Marlins hope you will bear with him.<P>

  ``When I see Livan I see a 21-year-old kid with a great arm but needing development,'' Boles said. ``The key is patience. It's hard for him, being under a microscope.<P>

  ``He needs to get better command of his pitches. He's pitching behind to a lot of batters.''<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  The Marlins were player-friendly with their treatment of Charlotte closer Mario Brito. They could have kept Brito, who had four saves and a 1.80 ERA when they sold him earlier this week to a Japanese club, as insurance in case of catastrophe to their major-league bullpen. Or they could have dealt him to another club's Triple A team for a prospect or cash.<P>

  Instead, they asked if he would like to be sold to the Tokyo Giants, where he could make a six-figure salary. Brito accepted, replacing struggling American Jeff Manto. Everyone's happy. And players around the league undoubtedly will remember.<P>

  Brito's last act at Charlotte, by the way, was winning a game with a three-run home run.<P>

  <LI> The Marlins replaced Brito with reliever Euclides Rojas. With road roommates Hernandez and Rojas, Charlotte now leads the International League in Cuban defectors.<P>

  Charlotte also activated 1993 Organization Pitcher of the Year Vic Darensbourg and is trying to acquire another reliever.<P>

  <LI> INF Chris Clapinski is writing a season-long diary for USA Today Baseball Weekly.<P>

  <LI> Single A Brevard County: C Matt Erwin (.379, 5 2Bs), RHP Mike Parisi (3-0, 2.36 ERA), Australian OF Glen Reeves (.339).<P>

  <LI> Single A Kane County: RHP Vic Hurtado (2-0, 2.16), 2B Amaury Garcia (.333, 7 extra-base hits, 5 steals), 3B Josh Booty (.164, 8 RBI), OF Jaime Jones (.179, 2 HRs), 1B Nate Rolison (.317, 3 HRs).<P>

  <LI> Double A Portland: OF Pookie Wilson (.350), 3B Dave Berg (.298), OF Chris Sheff (.321, eight extra-base hits).<P>

  <LI> Triple A Charlotte: OF Darrell Whitmore (.351, 3 HRs).<BR>
