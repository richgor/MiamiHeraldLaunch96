     The Marlins are interested in two of the top South Florida prospects eligible for the June draft -- but wondering if either will be available.<P>

  LHP Eddie Yarnall, a Louisiana State junior from St. Thomas Aquinas, and INF Mike Caruso, a Douglas High senior, are projected to go somewhere between the second and fifth rounds. The Marlins won't go for either with the No. 9 overall pick, but they don't pick again until the fourth round. They sent their second- and third-round picks to Toronto in compensation for free agents Devon White and Al Leiter.<P>

  Contrary to recent reports, Caruso will not sign with the University of Miami. Caruso, who hit .483 this year, did not take a required geometry class in high school and learned of the mix-up too late. Ten major-league teams have visited his home, his father said.<P>

  Yarnall, the 1995 Cape Cod League Co-Pitcher of the Year, is 6-1 with a 2.48 ERA for LSU. He has been invited to try out for the U.S. Olympic team.<BR>
  RHP project Rob Dibble is getting closer to an assignment or simulated-game action, pitching coach Larry Rothschild said. Dibble's arm strength and work habits have impressed the Marlins, and as soon as he overcomes a few bad mechanical habits, he will be game-ready.<P>

  The Marlins have not ruled out moving Dibble directly into the big leagues if he continues to progress, then impresses in some simulated games. However, a stint at Triple A Charlotte might be more likely.<P>

  RHP Dave Weathers, who clawed his way onto the team this spring, has clawed up the bullpen pecking order and now is sharing set-up duties with Terry Mathews. Weathers, once the long reliever (read mop-up man), has the bullpen's lowest ERA (2.25 in 11 outings).<BR>
  RHP Matt Mantei was on the roster for the season's first 18 days because baseball rules dictated it. He stayed a little longer because of injuries. He is still here because he's earned it.<P>

 <BR>
<P>

   Only two active Marlins relievers (Robb Nen and Weathers) have a better ERA than Mantei's 3.38 in 10 2/3 innings. His 17 strikeouts rank fourth on the team, ahead of starters Chris Hammond (13 in 23 1/3 innings) and Pat Rapp (13 in 34). This from a guy whose spring ERA was near 8.00.<P>

  ``Back then, there were times I felt I didn't belong,'' Mantei said. ``But those times would go away. And now they're gone completely. I feel comfortable here.''<P>

  <LI> Alejandro Pena was moved from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day DL, meaning he likely won't return from his minor rotator-cuff tear before the All-Star break, if at all. The move frees up a spot on the 40-man roster.<P>

  <LI> SS Kurt Abbott, off to a solid .282 start (.462 slugging), has opened his stance, a la 1B Greg Colbrunn -- who lockers next to him. Abbott said the idea was his.<P>

  <LI> The U.S. Army's Jarret Behrens, 22, of Coral Springs, threw out the first pitch Wednesday. He returns to Bosnia on Monday.<BR>
   The mother of baseball star Gary Sheffield's 10-year-old daughter will receive less than a third of the $170,000 per year in child support payments she sought, a Pinellas County judge ruled Tuesday.<P>

   Sheffield was ordered to pay Davene Williams $3,500 per month in child support, and to provide his daughter, Ebony, with private school tuition, a college fund and medical expenses.<P>

   The package, which totals nearly $50,000 per year, is what Sheffield volunteered to pay last November.<BR>
