<H2>Padres end Marlins streak, 5-3</H2>

  It makes sense that this would happen to the Marlins on Earth Day.

   They came down to earth -- at least temporarily.<P>

   Ken Caminiti will do that to you.<P>

   So will Andy Ashby.<P>

   Florida was riding a <BR>
four-game winning streak and was coming off its most dramatic victory of the year before San Diego put an end to the streak with a 5-3 victory Monday in front of 17,473 at Joe Robbie Stadium.<P>

  Not even a Gary Sheffield home run could save the Marlins Monday.<P>

  Sheffield, who supplied the dramatics and emotions Sunday with a three-run homer in the seventh to lift Florida to a 5-4 victory over the Dodgers, ripped his ninth homer of the year in the eighth. But no one was on base, and the Marlins were left trailing 5-3. Seven of Sheffield's nine homers have been solo shots.<P>

   Sheffield is tied for the National League lead with Atlanta's Ryan Klesko, who hit his ninth homer Monday. The major league record for home runs in April is 11. <P>

  And while the Marlins were riding momentum, San Diego was riding a thin bullpen. The Padres went 15 innings Sunday and needed all they could get from Ashby, who gave them just what they ordered -- a complete game.<P>

  He gave up seven hits and a couple of homers -- Kurt Abbott gave the Marlins a 1-0 lead with his second homer in the third -- but when he needed a big play, Caminiti or center fielder Steve Finley, a pair of Gold Glove winners in 1995, seemed to be right where they needed to be.<P>

  The Marlins will have to look at Caminiti again today, then they won't see him again until the last weekend in July. That will be too soon for Florida.<P>

  Caminiti destroyed the Marlins in San Diego, stealing at least a half dozen hits and almost as many runs with his Gold Glove. He took another run away Monday. Jeff Conine, who drove in Florida's second run with a two-out single in the third, singled in the sixth and probably would have scored if not for Caminiti.<P>

  Greg Colbrunn ripped a two-out grounder down the third-base line, but Caminiti took away the double and ended the inning with the play of the night, diving and falling backward behind the bag and throwing across the infield in a sitting position as he fell backward.<P>

  ``I saw enough of that in San Diego,'' said Marlins Manager Rene Lachemann. ``This team has played very good defense against us. Finley made some plays. That's what defense can do for you. It takes away doubles. It takes away runs.''<P>

  John Burkett, who admitted he wasn't sharp, took the loss, after battling on a night when the velocity on his fastball was missing.<P>

  Burkett had some tough luck in the fifth he gave up a one-out double to Jody Reed and Andjuar Cede&ntilde;o followed with a triple to right center to tie things at 2-2. Burkett should have walked away with the score still tied, but Ashby, who had four hits in his last game and entered hitting .444, hit a sacrifice fly to right field. Gary Sheffield's throw beat Cede&ntilde;o, but the ball short-hopped catcher Charles Johnson, and he couldn't hang on to the ball, and the Padres led, 3-2.<P>

  ``You have to make pitches,'' Burkett said. ``I have to get Cede&ntilde;o, and I have to strike out the pitcher. If I do that, we are in the game and Sheff hits the home run later and we have the lead.<P>

  ``To me the worst part of the game was not getting the eighth and ninth hitters. That produced two runs. I didn't get it done.''<P>

  The Padres added a run in the sixth on three singles as Jody Reed brought home Marc Newfield with a two-out flare to left field that traveled just far enough to lift San Diego to a 4-2 lead.<P>

  Caminiti hurt the Marlins again in the eighth at the plate and on the bases. He singled and raced to second when Joe Orsulak had trouble handling the ball. Then Caminiti went to third on a wild pitch, barely beating the throw from Johnson. He scored on Scott Livingstone's opposite field single.<P>

  ``But all the Marlins left the clubhouse talking about Caminiti's glove.<P>

  ``That's why he has that gold on his glove,'' Sheffield said. ``He's beaten us twice. He's one of those players you just don't want to hit the ball to. I guarantee Ashby loves having him on his team.''<P>
