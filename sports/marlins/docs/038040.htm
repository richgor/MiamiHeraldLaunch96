  The middle infield of the future is here -- today.<P>

   Shortstop Edgar Renteria, 20, and second baseman Ralph Milliard, 22, who have been playing together for more than two years, arrived in the big leagues together Friday.<P>

   The Marlins had to call up both, because of a strange turn of events. Florida put shortstop Kurt Abbott, who has been suffering from dizziness, and second baseman Quilvio Veras, who strained his left hamstring in the eighth inning Thursday, on the 15-day disabled list, and had to make two calls to Triple A Charlotte.<P>

  Renteria, who is considered the best prospect in the Marlins organization, told Marlins vice president of player personal John Boles 15 days ago that he was ready for the majors. <P>

  ``I told him I was ready. I didn't want to play at Triple A,'' said Renteria.<P>

  Seven members of the Colombian media will be at Joe Robbie Stadium tonight because of Renteria, who is only the fourth player from that nation to play in the majors. He is also the first Latin player to go through the Marlins' farm system.<P>

  Renteria and Milliard were overmatched at the plate this spring. Renteria, who was hitting .278 at Charlotte, hit only .091 this spring. Milliard, who was hitting .291 at Charlotte, hit only .095 this spring. <P>

  Milliard becomes only the second player from Curacao to play in the majors. Milliard was born in Curacao, but moved to the Netherlands when he was 12, and later played for the Dutch national team. He speaks four languages (English, Dutch, French and Papmiento).<P>

  Both are expected to play together at some point this weekend, possibly Sunday.<BR>
Weathers demoted<BR>
<P>

  The Marlins activated reliever Jay Powell Friday, and had to make a roster move. The move shocked pitcher Dave Weathers, who was sent to Charlotte.<P>

  ``I don't like it. There's nothing I can do about it,'' said Weathers who battled all spring amid trade rumors. ``I don't think it's fair. You can take a look at my numbers, but I only had two bad innings. If you take those away, I'm in the 2's'' in ERA.
