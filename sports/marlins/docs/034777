  With the exception of closer <m0>Robb Nen, <m0>the Marlins' bullpen has been turned upside down because of injuries, demotions and good outings from unexpected sources.<ep>
  Former starter <m0>Chris Hammond <m0>is the long man and probable spot starter, should such a situation arise. Former long man <m0>Dave Weathers <m0>has pitched his way into a set-up committee with <m0>Terry Mathews <m0>and lefty specialist <m0>Yorkis Perez <m0>(--) neither of whom was expected to have that role when the season began. The set-up role became available when <m0>Alejandro Pen~a <m0>and <m0>Jay Powell <m0>went on the disabled list.<ep>
  Former mop-up man <m0>Matt Mantei <m0>also has pitched his way into middle-inning appearances.<ep>
  The result is a bullpen with few clearly defined roles, although pitching coach <m0>Larry Rothschild <m0>likes the flexibility.<ep>
  ``It's a matter of who's throwing well at a given moment,'' he said. ``We have a guy who's on a roll, he'll get certain innings over a guy who isn't.''<ep>
  (box) Assuming no complications from throwing in a simulated game Wednesday, Powell likely will be sent to Triple A Charlotte, perhaps as soon as Friday, for one or two rehab outings before being activated (--) possibly by the end of the weekend or early next week. He had a strained rib cage muscle. <m1><ep>
<m0>  The logical choice to be optioned to Charlotte would be Mantei, although he has the bullpen's second-lowest ERA and has earned a spot on a roster originally handed to him by Rule V guidelines.<ql>
<m0>Mum's the word<ep>
<m0>   The Marlins were instructed Monday not to talk about ejections with the media, a directive players said came from President <m0>Don Smiley <m0>as a result of a pair of bizarre ejections (--) third baseman <m0>Terry Pendleton, <m0>who insisted the umpires got the wrong man; and <m0>equipment manager <m0> Mike Wallace <m0>(--) this weekend at Colorado.<ep>
  The Marlins were asked not to speak about ejections that happened this weekend, or ever.<ql>
<m0>40-man flexibility<ep>
<m0>   By moving Pen~a to the 60-day DL last week, the Marlins opened a spot on their 40-man roster. They still haven't filled it, giving them several options, including using it to claim a player off waivers.<ep>
  The available 40-man spot also would allow the Marlins to promote any player in their system to the major leagues. They would have to give him the last remaining 40-man spot.<ep>
  The spot could be used for Charlotte heavy hitters such as OF <m0>Darrell Whitmore <m0>or C <m0>Jerry Brooks, <m0>or CF <m0>Marquis Riley <m0>or even P <m0>Rob Dibble <m0>(--) who will throw batting practice this week, and then throw in a simulated game.<ep>
  (box) The Marlins have Pen~a under a two-year contract, but can buy out the second year (--) worth $750,000 (--) for $50,000. Even if Pen~a (torn rotator cuff) is physically unable to pitch next season, the Marlins would have to buy out the 1997 year on his contract.<ql>
<m0>Lineup moves<ep>
<m0>  Marlins Manager <m0>Rene Lachemann <m0>tinkered with his lineup, moving C <m0>Charles Johnson <m0>from seventh to eighth. Also, <m0>Jeff Conine <m0>was moved to fifth.<ep>
  ``I'm pulling all kinds of tricks out of my hat,'' Lachemann deadpanned.<ep>
  (box) <m0>Alex Arias <m0>replaced <m0>Kurt Abbott <m0>(dizziness) in the lineup and hit seventh.<ql>
<m4>--11.485 inches ( 69p2 )--from start of measuring to here--<m2><ql>
