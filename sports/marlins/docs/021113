  The Marlins fear leadoff batter 2B <m0>Quilvio Veras, <m0>whose left hamstring has bothered him most of the season, might never be as fast as last year when he led the majors in stolen bases with 56.<ep>
  ``I don't know if he'll ever get back to 100 percent,'' Manager <m0>Rene Lachemann <m0>said.<ep>
  Veras' time from first to second is about two-tenths of a <m4>Veras<m2><ql>
<m0>second slower than last year, before he hurt the hamstring in the final two weeks of the season. He has stolen two bases in six tries.<ql>
<m1>Bench fails to contribute<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0><ep>
  The Marlins targeted two areas this off-season: pitching and depth.<ep>
  The pitching is better. The depth?<ep>
  ``I think our bench will be more productive than last year,'' Lachemann said. ``Right now I can say in fact it has not been.''<ep>
  After Tuesday's 7-2 loss to the Padres, Marlins pinch hitters are 2 for 24. But the problem is not limited to late-inning, one-shot hitting.<ep>
  The Marlins' bench is a combined 16 for 105 (.152). The three busiest bench men, OF <m0>Jesus Tavarez <m0>and off-season pickups OF <m0>Joe Orsulak <m0>and INF <m0>Craig Grebeck <m0>are hitting .040, .129 and .095.<ep>
  The Marlins rested three starters Tuesday, and from their reserves, Grebeck, Orsulak and C <m0>Bob Natal <m0>got one hit in 10 at-bats.<ql>
<m1>Sheffield nears records<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  The next home run <m0>Gary Sheffield <m0>hits this month would tie his team record for home runs in April, or any month. He hit 10 in April 1994, and has nine with six games left this month. The major-league record for homers in April is 11, by <m0>Graig Nettles, Willie Stargell <m0>and <m0>Mike Schmidt.<m0><ql>
<m1>Dibble staying home<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Contrary to the original plan, <m0>Rob Dibble <m0>will not join the team on its road trip to Pittsburgh and San Francisco. He said he is at least two weeks away simply from getting rid of bad mechanical habits, and will stay home to work on that.<ep>
  (box) Marlins LHP <m0>Chris Hammond, <m0>who hasn't allowed a steal since May 1994, picked off baseball's all-time base stealer, <m0>Rickey Henderson, <m0>after Henderson led off the third with a bloop hit to right. It was Hammond's finest moment. He would walk two, hit another, and give up two hits before leaving with two out in the inning.<ep>
  Henderson later added his first steal of the season, on his fourth try, in the fourth.<ep>
  (box) First Natal goes 20 games without his first at-bat of the season, and then when he finally gets it, something upstages him. As Natal hit a ground ball to third in the third, a fan threw a tennis ball onto the infield, and the balls nearly crossed paths.<ql>
