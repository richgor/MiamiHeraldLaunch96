  With the exception of closer Robb Nen, the Marlins' bullpen has been turned upside down because of injuries, demotions and good outings from unexpected sources.<P>

  Former starter Chris Hammond is the long man and probable spot starter, should such a situation arise. Former long man Dave Weathers has pitched his way into a set-up committee with Terry Mathews and lefty specialist Yorkis Perez -- neither of whom was expected to have that role when the season began. The set-up role became available when Alejandro Pe&ntilde;a and Jay Powell went on the disabled list.<P>

  Former mop-up man Matt Mantei also has pitched his way into middle-inning appearances.<P>

  The result is a bullpen with few clearly defined roles, although pitching coach Larry Rothschild likes the flexibility.<P>

  ``It's a matter of who's throwing well at a given moment,'' he said. ``We have a guy who's on a roll, he'll get certain innings over a guy who isn't.''<P>

  <LI> Assuming no complications from throwing in a simulated game Wednesday, Powell likely will be sent to Triple A Charlotte, perhaps as soon as Friday, for one or two rehab outings before being activated -- possibly by the end of the weekend or early next week. He had a strained rib cage muscle. <P>

  The logical choice to be optioned to Charlotte would be Mantei, although he has the bullpen's second-lowest ERA and has earned a spot on a roster originally handed to him by Rule V guidelines.<BR>
Mum's the word<P>

   The Marlins were instructed Monday not to talk about ejections with the media, a directive players said came from President Don Smiley as a result of a pair of bizarre ejections -- third baseman Terry Pendleton, who insisted the umpires got the wrong man; and equipment manager  Mike Wallace -- this weekend at Colorado.<P>

  The Marlins were asked not to speak about ejections that happened this weekend, or ever.<BR>
40-man flexibility<P>

   By moving Pe&ntilde;a to the 60-day DL last week, the Marlins opened a spot on their 40-man roster. They still haven't filled it, giving them several options, including using it to claim a player off waivers.<P>

  The available 40-man spot also would allow the Marlins to promote any player in their system to the major leagues. They would have to give him the last remaining 40-man spot.<P>

  The spot could be used for Charlotte heavy hitters such as OF Darrell Whitmore or C Jerry Brooks, or CF Marquis Riley or even P Rob Dibble -- who will throw batting practice this week, and then throw in a simulated game.<P>

  <LI> The Marlins have Pe&ntilde;a under a two-year contract, but can buy out the second year -- worth $750,000 -- for $50,000. Even if Pe&ntilde;a (torn rotator cuff) is physically unable to pitch next season, the Marlins would have to buy out the 1997 year on his contract.<BR>
Lineup moves<P>

  Marlins Manager Rene Lachemann tinkered with his lineup, moving C Charles Johnson from seventh to eighth. Also, Jeff Conine was moved to fifth.<P>

  ``I'm pulling all kinds of tricks out of my hat,'' Lachemann deadpanned.<P>

  <LI> Alex Arias replaced Kurt Abbott (dizziness) in the lineup and hit seventh.
