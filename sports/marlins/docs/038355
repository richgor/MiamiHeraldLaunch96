<m0>line and playing it into a double, Huskey stormed into the dugout and threw his glove to the floor.<ep>
  The Marlins had five hits in the fourth. Most days, three of them would have been outs.<ep>
  Meanwhile, the Marlins did what they always seem to when Leiter is on the mound (--) score enough to win. Leiter (5-2) has nearly half the Marlins' 12 victories. Staff ace Kevin Brown, whose 2.26 ERA is better than Leiter's 2.80, has a 2-4 record.<ep>
  ``That's baseball. It's such a team game,'' Leiter said. ``Look at Kevin. He's one of the best pitchers in the league and has two wins to show for it.''<ep>
  Other than the mistakes, both teams played similarly. The Marlins had 10 hits to the Mets' nine. Neither team committed an error. Both staffs walked only two batters.<ep>
  The difference was Clark's miscues and Leiter, who dominated everyone in the Mets' lineup except for center fielder Lance Johnson, the one batter who had faced him before. Johnson was 4 for 12 against him when they were in the American League. In 6 2/3 innings, Leiter allowed eight hits (--) four were Johnson's.<ep>
  ``I gave him every pitch I had, and he hit them all,'' Leiter said.<ep>
  Leiter gave up one run, struck out a Marlins season high-tying nine and walked two.<ep>
  Leiter left under duress, with Mets at the corners with two outs in the seventh. Reliever Terry Mathews came on and struck out Bernard Gilkey to end the inning, and pitched a perfect eighth.<ep>
  Closer Robb Nen got his fifth save when pinch-hitter Rico Brogna grounded into a double play to end the game.<ep>
  Conine narrowly missed homering for a fourth consecutive game. His double in the fourth banged high off the wall in left. He had homered in all three games at Colorado.<ep>
  The victory tasted great to Lachemann, whose manager's job probably is among the league's most tenuous thanks to the Marlins 12-21 start.<ep>
  ``I might tinker with the lineup,'' Lachemann said afterward, ``maybe move [Charles Johnson] to seventh . . . ah, with a win, I'll leave this damn lineup the way it is.''<ql>
<m0>Abbott ``could barely stand''<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Shortstop <m0>Kurt Abbott, <m0>a late scratch from the lineup, will undergo more tests today to determine why he has been plagued with dizziness for the past year.<ep>
  Abbott said he believes the eustachian tubes in his ears are clogged, upsetting his equilibrium. After batting practice, ``he could barely stand,'' Manager <m0>Rene Lachemann <m0>said.<ql>
