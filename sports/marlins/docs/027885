<m0>  <m0>Andre Dawson<m0> will plead not guilty today in a Denver courtroom on charges he disturbed the peace in a 1995 incident in which a hotel valet claimed Dawson shoved him.<ep>
   Dawson said he expects the valet to file a civil suit if the criminal suit ends in Dawson's being found guilty. He rejected a plea bargain.<ep>
   ``If I felt I was guilty, I could have done something about it,'' said Dawson, who likely would face no more than a fine if convicted. ``[But] it can be easy for a prosecutor to sway a jury on a disturbing the peace charge.''<ep>
   Dawson expects the case to end today, but fears it could go well into the afternoon. He will be in court at 8 a.m.<ep>
   ``It's going to take a while,'' Dawson said.<ql>

<m0>  The Marlins squashed rumors out of Cincinnati that the Reds were trying to trade left-hander <m0>Pete Schourek<m0> for Marlins right-hander <m0>John Burkett,<m0> saying the teams had had no contact.<ql>
<m1>Leiter: No disrespect<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  LHP <m0>Al Leiter<m0> said he meant no disrespect when he grunted after striking out Phillies slugger <m0>Pete Incaviglia<m0> Wednesday night. ``I grunt after every pitch,'' Leiter said. ``I definitely didn't show him up. He can think that.''<ep>
   He does. Incaviglia discoursed on the subject for some time after the game (--) after blasting a 482-foot homer off Leiter. ``I was raised to show respect,'' Incaviglia said. ``I wasn't shown respect.''<ep>
   (box) When Marlins pitching coach <m0>Larry Rothschild<m0> called to get the bullpen warmed up Wednesday night, he found the phone disconnected. Bullpen coach <m0>Joe Breeden<m0> was summoned to sprint the request to warm up <m0>Dave Weathers<m0> from the dugout to the bullpen.<ep>
   (box) LF <m0>Jeff Conine's<m0> visit to an ophthalmologist Thursday revealed nothing new. He will take antibiotics and switch contacts to counter irritation.<ep>
   (box) RHP <m0>Matt Mantei<m0> (3.38 ERA, 17 strikeouts, 5 hits allowed in 10 2/3 innings) is working his way toward appearing in pressure situations, Rothschild said.<ql>
