  The Marlins didn't forget how to win.<ep>
  But Mets starter Mark Clark forgot how to cover first base.<ep>
  Those two facts were intertwined Monday night when the Marlins capitalized on consecutive mental gaffes by Clark, and overcame a pair of mistakes of their own for a 4-1 victory in front of 16,819 at Joe Robbie Stadium. The victory ended a five-game losing streak for the Marlins, who had lost seven of their past eight to plummet to the National League East basement.<ep>
  ``Other than a couple of baserunning mistakes, we played a solid game,'' Marlins Manager Rene Lachemann said. ``Mr. [Al] Leiter pitched well, the bullpen did its job and we put together some timely hits. It was nice to see that.''<ep>
  The baserunning mistakes<ju>
<m1><styl>indentl,12p6,3p3<ql>
<m0>came on double plays that started with flyouts and ended with Marlins getting thrown out at the plate (Terry Pendleton in the fourth) and third base (Alex Arias in the sixth). Arias' out erased what would have been a run by Jeff Conine, who tagged at third but apparently didn't score before Arias was caught at third.<ep>
  ``That was pretty upsetting,'' Lachemann said of Arias' out. ``We've talked to him, and he knows.''<ep>
  The Marlins' mistakes were ``upsetting.''<ep>
  Clark's mistakes were crucial.<ep>
  The Marlins scored three in the fourth, an inning when Clark failed to cover first on a routine grounder to first baseman Butch Huskey (--) and then, bafflingly, did it again one batter later. After the inning, which began with Huskey overrunning Greg Colbrunn's ground ball down the line and playing it into a double, Huskey stormed into the dugout and threw his glove to the floor.<ep>
  The Marlins had five hits in the fourth. Most days, three of them would have been outs.<ep>
  Meanwhile, the Marlins did what they always seem to when Leiter is on the mound (--) score enough to win. Leiter (5-2) has nearly half the Marlins' 12 victories. Staff ace Kevin Brown, whose 2.26 ERA is better than Leiter's 2.80, has a 2-4 record.<ep>
  ``That's baseball. It's such a team game,'' Leiter said. ``Look at Kevin. He's one of the best pitchers in the league and has two wins to show for it.''<ep>
  Other than the mistakes, both teams played similarly. The Marlins had 10 hits to the Mets' nine. Neither team committed an error. Both staffs walked only two batters.<ep>
  The difference was Clark's miscues and Leiter, who dominated everyone in the Mets' lineup except for center fielder Lance Johnson, the one batter who had faced him before. Johnson was 4 for 12 against him when they were in the American League. In 6 2/3 innings, Leiter allowed eight hits (--) four were Johnson's.<ep>
  ``I gave him every pitch I had, and he hit them all,'' Leiter said.<ep>
  Leiter gave up one run, struck out a Marlins season-high-tying nine and walked two.<ep>
  Leiter left under duress, with Mets at the corners with two out in the seventh. Reliever Terry Mathews came on and struck out Bernard Gilkey to end the inning, and pitched a perfect eighth.<ep>
  Closer Robb Nen got his fifth save when pinch hitter Rico Brogna grounded into a double play to end the game.<ep>
  Conine narrowly missed homering for a fourth consecutive game. His double in the fourth banged high off the wall in left. He had homered in all three games at Colorado.<ep>
  The victory tasted great to Lachemann, whose manager's job probably is among the league's most tenuous thanks to the Marlins' 12-21 start.<ep>
  ``I might tinker with the lineup,'' Lachemann said afterward, ``maybe move [Charles Johnson] to seventh . . . ah, with a win, I'll leave this damn lineup the way it is.''<ql>
<m0>Abbott ``could barely stand''<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Shortstop <m0>Kurt Abbott, <m0>a late scratch from the lineup, will undergo more tests today to determine why he has been plagued with dizziness for the past year.<ep>
  Abbott said he believes the eustachian tubes in his ears are clogged, upsetting his equilibrium. After batting practice, ``he could barely stand,'' Lachemann said.<ql>
