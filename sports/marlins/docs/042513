<m0>  Expos center fielder <m0>Rondell White <m0>was injured Saturday when he made a diving catch and crashed into the fence at Coors Field.<ep>
   White collided with the wall after catching a drive hit by <m0>Larry Walker. <m0>He appeared to strike the wall with his left shoulder. He laid on the warning track for several minutes while being attended to by Montreal trainers.<ep>
   He was taken to Rose Medical Center for precautionary X-rays of his left rib cage and back. Montreal officials said he also suffered a bruised left kidney.<ql>
<m1>Reds' changing lineup<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  One of these days, <m0>Ray Knight <m0>is going to use the same lineup twice. There's just no telling when that day will come.<ep>
   Injuries and slumps have forced the Reds' rookie manager to use a different lineup every day. The one he handed in Saturday for a game against Philadelphia was his 24th different combination in 24 games.<ep>
   Knight likes to tinker with the lineup (--) he stays up at night mulling different combinations. But he's getting tired of wasting so much paper to come up with that daily list of nine names.<ep>
   Most of the changes have been out of necessity. The Reds opened the season with six players on the disabled list. <m0>Reggie Sanders <m0>became the seventh to land on the DL when he severely injured his lower back two weeks into the season. He is out at least another month.<ep>
   Two other factors have compounded the problem. <m0>Chris Sabo <m0>and <m0>Eric Davis <m0>are not physically able to play every day, and several others have minor injuries. Add in deep slumps by several healthy players, and it becomes a lineup du jour.<ql>

<m0>  <m0>(box) CUBS: <m0>Chicago turned a neat trick this month. In playing the Los Angeles Dodgers eight times in April, the turn of the teams' five-man rotations fell in such a way that the Cubs never had to face the Dodgers' ace, <m0>Hideo Nomo. <m0>They aren't missing him, either. Last year, Nomo was 2-0 with a 3.07 ERA in two starts against the Cubs, striking out 15 in 14 2/3 innings.<ep>

<m0>  <m0>(box) CARDINALS: <m0>In St. Louis' first 23 games, relievers made 67 appearances. Ten of the games were decided by one run, six won by the Cardinals.<ep>
