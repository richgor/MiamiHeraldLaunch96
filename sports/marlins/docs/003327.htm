  Marlins shortstop Kurt Abbott went through a series of tests Wednesday to check his blood sugar. Today, he'll find out the results of those tests and also see a chiropractor. On Monday he'll visit an allergist. All this in an effort to find a reason and a cure for his dizziness.<P>

  It's enough to make you dizzy.<P>

  ``We just want to try everything to find out what is causing it,'' said Abbott, who will be out of the lineup until he's cured.<P>

  ``He says he thinks he can play,'' Marlins Manager Rene Lachemann said. ``But he says he is still dizzy. I'm not going to put someone out there who is dizzy.''<P>

  Said Abbott: ``I think I can play, but I don't want to do anything that might cause future damage.''<P>

  Abbott said he felt the dizziness as early as last year but didn't do anything about it. He said it progressed slowly. Then on Friday night, Abbott scored from first and was not only winded in the thin air at Denver's Coors Field, but dizzy too.<P>

  ``I sat down on the bench and my head was spinning,'' he said.<P>

  If Abbott goes on the disabled list, the Marlins would consider calling up SS Edgar Renteria from Triple A Charlotte. Abbott is hitting .272 with a .424 slugging percentage. Renteria is hitting .287 with two home runs and 15 RBI.<BR>
Tobacco-chewers concerned<P>

  Whether or not smokeless tobacco had anything to do with Dodger outfielder Brett Butler's throat cancer, it has rattled many players who chew tobacco.<P>

  ``Yeah, it's scary,'' said Marlins 1B Greg Colbrunn, who says he's tried to cut back by changing to a lighter tobacco. ``I went from Copenhagen to Skoal,'' Colbrunn said. ``I think we all want to quit. But it's hard.''<P>

  Said Kurt Abbott, who has been chewing tobacco for nine years: ``Whether it had anything to do with it or not, it still makes you think. But when you are using smokeless tobacco, you just can't go out and quit. It isn't that easy.''<P>

   Butler said he chewed tobacco for two or three years but stopped about 15 years ago.<P>

  <LI> Kevin Brown, who had to leave Tuesday's game after being hit on his lower right leg by a grounder, said he felt sore Wednesday, but he is not expected to miss his next start -- Sunday against the Rockies.<P>

  <LI> Jay Powell pitched Wednesday at Single A Brevard, throwing against hitters for the first time since suffering a rib injury April 20. He pitched two innings against Sarasota and did not allow a hit, striking out four, three looking. Powell could come off the DL Friday. If he does, the Marlins must make a roster move to make room for him. Powell would move into the role of the No. 1 set-up man for closer Robb Nen.<P>

  <LI> Chris Hammond, who was moved to the bullpen to regain his confidence, pitched three innings of relief Tuesday, and came away with . . . a little more confidence.<P>

  ``At first I was nervous, more nervous than when I start,'' Hammond said. ``But once I was out there, it was OK. I needed that. I'm glad to get the three innings in. We will go from here.''<P>

  <LI> Gary Sheffield will join volunteers Friday to help build a home as part of the Habitat for Humanity program. Sheffield will help build a home for Earnestine Tellis, an Army veteran who commutes 166 miles a day from Pompano Beach to her job as a corrections officer at a state prison in Florida City.<P>

  <LI> Jeff Conine has formed a new program called Jeff Conine's Hits for Kids in cooperation with Joe DiMaggio's Children's Hospital. For each Conine hit this season, individuals and companies will pledge money in support of children's health care.<P>

   <LI> Third base coach Cookie Rojas, who had surgery Tuesday to remove bone chips from his right elbow, missed his second straight game. He's listed as day-to-day. Joe Breeden took his place Wednesday.
