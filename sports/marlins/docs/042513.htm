  Expos center fielder Rondell White was injured Saturday when he made a diving catch and crashed into the fence at Coors Field.<P>

   White collided with the wall after catching a drive hit by Larry Walker. He appeared to strike the wall with his left shoulder. He laid on the warning track for several minutes while being attended to by Montreal trainers.<P>

   He was taken to Rose Medical Center for precautionary X-rays of his left rib cage and back. Montreal officials said he also suffered a bruised left kidney.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  One of these days, Ray Knight is going to use the same lineup twice. There's just no telling when that day will come.<P>

   Injuries and slumps have forced the Reds' rookie manager to use a different lineup every day. The one he handed in Saturday for a game against Philadelphia was his 24th different combination in 24 games.<P>

   Knight likes to tinker with the lineup -- he stays up at night mulling different combinations. But he's getting tired of wasting so much paper to come up with that daily list of nine names.<P>

   Most of the changes have been out of necessity. The Reds opened the season with six players on the disabled list. Reggie Sanders became the seventh to land on the DL when he severely injured his lower back two weeks into the season. He is out at least another month.<P>

   Two other factors have compounded the problem. Chris Sabo and Eric Davis are not physically able to play every day, and several others have minor injuries. Add in deep slumps by several healthy players, and it becomes a lineup du jour.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  <LI> CUBS: Chicago turned a neat trick this month. In playing the Los Angeles Dodgers eight times in April, the turn of the teams' five-man rotations fell in such a way that the Cubs never had to face the Dodgers' ace, Hideo Nomo. They aren't missing him, either. Last year, Nomo was 2-0 with a 3.07 ERA in two starts against the Cubs, striking out 15 in 14 2/3 innings.<P>

<P>

  <LI> CARDINALS: In St. Louis' first 23 games, relievers made 67 appearances. Ten of the games were decided by one run, six won by the Cardinals.<P>
