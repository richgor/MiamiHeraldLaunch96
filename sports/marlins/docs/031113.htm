  On the heels of their second consecutive victory Tuesday night, the Marlins got some grim news: SS Kurt Abbott will undergo five hours of tests today to determine why he is suffering from dizziness, and said he ``won't play again until the problem is resolved.''<P>

  Abbott said he easily could miss as much as week. After tests today <BR>
the Marlins hope to know whether or not a stint on the disabled list will be necessary.<P>

  Abbott is hitting .272 with a .424 slugging percentage.<P>

  ``Right now, if I tilt my head back and close my eyes, I get dizzy,'' Abbott said. ``Something is definitely wrong. It could be a while.''<BR>
Hammond better on side<P>

    When he lost his spot in the rotation, LHP Chris Hammond believes, the only reason he wasn't demoted to Triple A Charlotte was because he was throwing so well on the side. He has continued to throw well on the side, and that is why he hopes to return to the rotation soon.<P>

  ``They want me to get my confidence back and do what I'm doing, on the side, in the games,'' Hammond said. ``The pitches are there, or they would have sent me to Charlotte. I just need to make the pitches in the games.''<P>

  With Kurt Miller up from Charlotte to be the No. 5 starter, Hammond is the bullpen's long man. He said he hasn't considered whether the Marlins would try to trade him, but he acknowledged a trade would make more sense than an extended stay in the bullpen.<P>

  ``I believe I'm a major-league starting pitcher, and I think they [the Marlins] believe it, too,'' Hammond said. ``They don't want me in the bullpen for two months.''<BR>
Lachemann: no wheels<BR>
<P>

  Marlins Manager Rene Lachemann is out one automobile after loaning it to Marlins travel coordinator Bill Beck -- who had the car stolen from outside his Fort Lauderdale home after Monday's game.<P>

   When he first told reporters of his misfortune, Lachemann insisted they not report it. ``It's just for a little humor,'' he said.<P>

  Later, after prodding, Lachemann relented: ``Maybe it'll help [police] find it.''<BR>
<LI> The Marlins have six pitchers in their bullpen, but eight relief choices. The other two: OFs Andre Dawson and Joe Orsulak. ``If it's a blowout, I might bring one of those guys in,'' Lachemann said.<P>

   <LI> Because of weather problems in the northeast, set-up man Jay Powell could be activated as soon as Friday.<P>

   Bad weather is why the Marlins chose not to send Powell on a rehab assignment to Charlotte. Instead, he will skip a scheduled simulated game appearance today for an outing at Single A Brevard County. If all goes well, he will join the Marlins Friday -- the day he was to go to Charlotte.<P>

   <LI> Marlins third-base coach Cookie Rojas was in uniform Tuesday, hours after having three bone chips removed from his throwing elbow. Rojas' turn in the BP rotation was taken Tuesday by Tony Perez. Joe Breeden coached third.<P>

   <LI> The Marlins returned the contract of OF Shane Halter, on loan to Charlotte from the Royals, and replaced him with Portland INF Tony Torres. They activated OF Jason Robertson to replace Torres at Portland.
