<m0>  Charles Johnson homered. Greg Colbrunn homered. What about Gary Sheffield? With one last chance to break the record for home runs in April, he got hit in the backside in the seventh. Sheffield blinked once, rubbed his backside, and jogged to first base, ending a bizarre month that saw him tie <m1> <m0>five others with 11 April home runs but experience mostly frustration as the Marlins dropped to last in the division.<ep>
   Sheffield's grim trot to first was one of two glum moments on an otherwise glorious Tuesday night for the Marlins, who rarely have combined good starting pitching with good hitting (--) but did just that in a 7-2 victory against the Phillies.<ep>
   Only 15,252 saw it, well below the previous JRS low of <m4>  <m2><ql>
<m0>16,230 last Sept. 25 against the Expos. One fan, a young woman sitting behind the third-base dugout, was hit in the head by a Quilvio Veras liner in the fifth. Seeing the blood, Marlins on-deck batter Devon White ran a towel to the stands. The woman, who walked out of the stadium with help from officials after five minutes, required three or four towels.<ep>
   The fans who waited out a 10-minute rain delay for the first pitch (--) and avoided stray foul balls (--) saw Marlins right-hander Pat Rapp recapture the magic of 1995, when he went 11-2 after the All-Star Game and threw back-to-back September shutouts.<ep>
   Through eight innings, Rapp allowed five hits (--) two in the infield, one a bloop to right (--) and walked no one. Twice he retired 10 consecutive batters. No Phillie got past second base until the eighth.<ep>
   Rapp left with one out in the ninth after giving up a walk and two hits.<ep>
  After Johnson's two-run homer in the sixth gave the Marlins a 4-0 lead with Rapp dominant, about the only drama left was Sheffield's attempt to untie himself with Mike Schmidt, Willie Stargell, Graig Nettles, <m1> <m0>Brady Anderson and Barry Bonds (--) all of whom have hit 11 home runs in April.<ep>
   With the crowd cheering with one out in the seventh, Sheffield fouled off several pitches before Phillies reliever Toby Borland hit him on his back left pocket. Borlafd, perhaps feeling guilty for robbing Sheffield of a chance at the April record, did what he could to make sure Sheffield got one more at-bat. He gave up a three-run home run to Colbrunn, then walked the next two batters before striking out Rapp to end the seventh.<ep>
   Sheffield, scheduled to hit fourth in the eighth, nearly got his last chance when Veras walked to open against Phillies left-hander Steve Frey. The chance disappeared when White grounded into a double play and Jeff Conine struck out, leaving Sheffield waiting on deck.<ep>
   ``Records are very nice,'' Marlins Manager Rene Lachemann said, ``but we're out to win. Gary Sheffield had a heck of a month. But the bottom line is winning baseball games.''<ep>
   Sheffield's first attempt at the record came when he led off the second. He didn't homer, but did flick a single into right. He moved to second on Terry Pendleton's walk, but was doubled off the bag on Colbrunn's lineout to Mark Whiten in right.<ep>
   In his second at-bat, in the fourth, Sheffield grounded Williams' first pitch to short.<ep>
   In the fifth, Sheffield fouled off the first pitch, then popped up the next one to first baseman Kevin Jordan. That ended the inning with runners on first and second. When Sheffield reached first, he took off his helmet and banged it against the bag.<ep>
   More frustration awaited.<ql>
