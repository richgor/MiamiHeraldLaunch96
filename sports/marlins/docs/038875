<m0>  <m0>Dave Weathers <m0>is throwing harder in the bullpen than he did as a starter.<ep>
  ``He was throwing 94 and maybe 95 Sunday night,'' Marlins Manager <m0>Rene Lachhemann <m0>said. ``I don't think I've ever seen him throw that hard.''<ep>
  Weathers, 0-0 with a 4.50 ERA in seven relief appearances, said it's because of his limited work.<ep>
  ``My arm is stronger,'' he said. ``I used to get a lot more innings, but it's a different role out of the bullpen. I don't think about it being a role. I just think about getting outs.''<ql>
<m1>Brito sent to Japan<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  The Marlins completed a deal Monday, selling the rights of relief pitcher <m0>Mario Brito <m0>to the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants.<ep>
   Brito signed with Florida as a free agent this spring, but did not make the major-league roster and was sent to Triple A Charlotte. The Marlins had no plans to bring Brito to the majors and gave him the option of going to Japan. Brito pitched for the Taiwan Brother Elephants last season.<ql>
<m1>White not yet ready<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  CF <m0>Devon White, <m0>who has been nursing an injured hamstring, said he might be back in the lineup any day. But he added he doesn't want to rush anything.<ep>
   ``It feels better,'' White said. ``It's a matter of getting it to where I don't have to come out of the lineup again.<ep>
   ``You just want to get it right. A hamstring is always like that. When you think it's ready, it's not.''<ql>
<m1>Brown protects teammate<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  The Marlins won't talk about <m0>Kevin Brown's <m0>retaliation pitch in Sunday night's game against the Dodgers, but they don't have to say anything (--) it's obvious.<ep>
   Brown made some friends on the Marlins when he threw a pitch at Dodgers pitcher <m0>Pedro Astacio's <m0>head. Astacio hit <m0>Greg Colbrunn <m0>in the helmet in the second inning. When Astacio came up in the third, Brown threw a high fastball behind his head.<ep>
  Dodger Manager <m0>Tommy Lasorda <m0>was furious and asked the umpires to eject Brown. But Brown remained and won his first game in the National League.<ep>
  Los Angeles' <m0>Brett Butler <m0>said he understood why Brown threw at Astacio. <m1><ep>
<m0>  ``If I as a hitter got hit, and my pitcher didn't protect me, then there's something wrong with that,'' Butler said. ``That's what Brown did. I guarantee you his teammates feel better about Brown today than they did before the game simply for the fact that he did his job.''<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  (box) Colbrunn, who left Sunday's game with a headache, felt fine and started Monday. He got a little tired of telling every reporter in South Florida he was OK.<ep>
   ``I'm fine,'' he shouted. ``My head is fine. My head is fine.''<ql>
<m1>Pen~a's career in jeopardy<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Marlins reliever <m0>Alejandro Pen~a's <m0>career is in jeopardy because of a shoulder injury similar to one he suffered more than a decade ago.<ep>
   Pen~a, 36, plans to see <m0>Dr. James Andrews <m0>in Birmingham, Ala., Monday for a second opinion on the rotator cuff tear discovered by the Marlins last week. Pen~a missed most of two seasons after undergoing rotator cuff surgery in 1985, but returned to pitch in three World Series.<ep>
   ``I proved everybody wrong the last time,'' said Pen~a, who signed a two-year deal with the Marlins last winter. ``Maybe I'll do it again.''<ep>
   Pen~a, who in 1993 suffered an elbow injury that sidelined him for two years, had his career resurrected last summer by the Marlins. General Manager <m0>Dave Dombrowski <m0>signed him to a minor league deal after he had been released by the Red Sox.<ep>
   Pen~a was 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA in 13 appearances with the Marlins before the Braves, seeking bullpen help on their way to the World Series, acquired Pen~a just before the Aug. 31 trading deadline.<ep>
   For the Braves, Pen~a went 2-1 with a 1.29 ERA in eight postseason appearances. Dombrowski then signed Pen~a to a new deal in December.<ep>
   Pen~a has pitched only four innings this season.<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  (box) The Marlins won't face the best hitter in baseball this week. <m0>Tony Gwynn <m0>is in San Diego with an inflamed bursa sac in his right heel, and will join the Padres when they return home Wednesday.<ql>
