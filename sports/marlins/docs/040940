  Rene Lachemann has managed by the book this season and occasionally seen it snap shut on his nose. So, even though the book suggests you don't necessarily bring in your closer to start the eighth (--) certainly not 24 hours after he saved another game (--) Lachemann ignored it Tuesday night.<ep>
  And won himself a game.<ep>
  With no-luck starter Kevin Brown forced to leave early after being hit in the leg by a ground ball, Lachemann got solid relief from Chris Hammond and Yorkis Perez. Then he went to closer Robb Nen to start the eighth, and Nen struck out four in two innings to save the Marlins' 3-2 victory against the Mets.<ep>
  Their second consecutive victory brought them within a game and a half of New York as the Marlins bid to get out of the National League East basement.<ep>
  ``With a lead at home I'll go to Nen in the eighth,'' Lachemann said. ``For me it was an easy decision.''<ep>
  Nen blew away the Mets, allowing only a meek single by Lance Johnson (--) his seventh hit in two games against the Marlins. Nen's first six pitches were strikes. He walked no one and picked up his sixth save.<ep>
  ``I felt better tonight than last night,'' Nen said. ``I was doing things in the bullpen that made me<ju>
<m1><styl>cxon<ql>
<m2> <ql>
<m1><styl>txt,1<ql>
<m0>feel like I would have success tonight.''<ep>
  For a low-scoring game with no lead changes, this one had plenty of subplots: the triumphant bullpen debut of demoted starter Hammond; the continued horrid luck of ace starter Brown; and the misfortune of having to coach third for the Marlins.<ep>
  Hammond (2-5), who lost his spot in the rotation after being bombed his last two outings by the Giants and Rockies, made his first bullpen appearance since early 1995 and contributed three innings of three-hit ball, good for his first victory since April 18 against the Braves.<ep>
  Brown, last in the majors in run-support with 1.74 for every nine innings, actually had a 2-0 lead after three innings (--) and then had to leave with soreness in his lower right leg, where he was hit by a Jeff Kent grounder in the second. The injury was not considered serious (--) X-rays were negative (--) and Brown is expected to make his next start Sunday against the Rockies.<ep>
  While he was in, Brown pitched well. He gave up no runs, three hits and a walk, and struck out three. The Mets loaded the bases in the third on a hit, walk and hit batter, but cleanup hitter Todd Hundley flew out to center field.<ep>
  Brown was asked if he would have liked to stay in the game with the lead. ``Do I have to answer that question?'' he said after rolling his eyes.<ep>
  Brown said he left because he no longer could push off his right foot, which would have put too much strain on his arm.<ep>
  ``There was a question whether I would blow out my arm,'' Brown said. ``I didn't think I would, but if I stay in there and it happens, it's only worse. . . . I'd say this is par for the course.''<ep>
  The Marlins' third-base coaches know the feeling. First, Cookie Rojas had surgery Tuesday to remove bone spurs in his elbow from throwing batting practice (--) 12 hours after two of his runners were thrown out trying to tag on fly balls Monday night.<ep>
  Rojas' replacement Tuesday, Joe Breeden, sent Devon White to be thrown out by about 15 feet at the plate in the third, curbing what could have been a monstrous inning to just two runs. In the sixth, Breeden was smacked in the thigh by a hard foul liner by Quilvio Veras. Breeden has filled in at third twice this season, and has had a runner thrown out at the plate both times.<ep>
  Not that the Marlins had no luck. They scored their third run, after pinch-hitter Joe Orsulak (walk) and Veras (single) reached with two out in the sixth, on White's bloop single to center. The Marlins also owed two of their runs in their 4-1 victory Monday against the Mets to well-placed, if not well-struck, hits.<ep>
  ``I'm not going to cry about any of it,'' Lachemann said. ``A win is a win.''<ep>
  It could have been a bigger win. The Marlins loaded the bases in the seventh and eighth with less than two out, and didn't score either time.<ql>
