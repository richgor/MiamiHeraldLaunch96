     The Marlins are interested in two of the top South Florida prospects eligible for the June draft (--) but wondering if either will be available.<ep>
  LHP <m0>Eddie Yarnall, <m0>a Louisiana State junior from St. Thomas Aquinas, and INF <m0>Mike Caruso, <m0>a Douglas High senior, are projected to go somewhere between the second and fifth rounds. The Marlins won't go for either with the No. 9 overall pick, but they don't pick again until the fourth round. They sent their second- and third-round picks to Toronto in compensation for free agents <m0>Devon White <m0>and <m0>Al Leiter.<m0><ep>
  Contrary to recent reports, Caruso will not sign with the University of Miami. Caruso, who hit .483 this year, did not take a required geometry class in high school and learned of the mix-up too late. Ten major-league teams have visited his home, his father said.<ep>
  Yarnall, the 1995 Cape Cod League Co-Pitcher of the Year, is 6-1 with a 2.48 ERA for LSU. He has been invited to try out for the U.S. Olympic team.<ql>
<m1>Dibble making progress<ep>
<m0>  RHP project <m0>Rob Dibble <m0>is getting closer to an assignment or simulated-game action, pitching coach <m0>Larry Rothschild <m0>said. Dibble's arm strength and work habits have impressed the Marlins, and as soon as he overcomes a few bad mechanical habits, he will be game-ready.<ep>
  The Marlins have not ruled out moving Dibble directly into the big leagues if he continues to progress, then impresses in some simulated games. However, a stint at Triple A Charlotte might be more likely.<ep>
  RHP <m0>Dave Weathers, <m0>who clawed his way onto the team this spring, has clawed up the bullpen pecking order and now is sharing set-up duties with <m0>Terry Mathews. <m0>Weathers, once the long reliever (read <m1> <m0>mop-up man), has the bullpen's lowest ERA (2.25 in 11 outings).<ql>
<m1>Mantei earning keep<ep>
<m0>  RHP <m0>Matt Mantei <m0>was on the roster for the season's first 18 days because baseball rules dictated it. He stayed a little longer because of injuries. He is still here because he's earned it.<ep>
<m1><styl>cxon<ql>
<m2> <ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Only two active Marlins relievers <m0>(Robb Nen <m0>and Weathers) have a better ERA than Mantei's 3.38 in 10 2/3 innings. His 17 strikeouts rank fourth on the team, ahead of starters <m0>Chris Hammond <m0>(13 in 23 1/3 innings) and <m0>Pat Rapp <m0>(13 in 34). This from a guy whose spring ERA was near 8.00.<ep>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<m0>  ``Back then, there were times I felt I didn't belong,'' Mantei said. ``But those times would go away. And now they're gone completely. I feel comfortable here.''<ep>
  <m0>(box) Alejandro Pena <m0>was moved from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day DL, meaning he likely won't return from his minor rotator-cuff tear before the All-Star break, if at all. The move frees up a spot on the 40-man roster.<ep>
  (box) SS <m0>Kurt Abbott, <m0>off to a solid .282 start (.462 slugging), has opened his stance, <m0>a la <m0>1B <m0>Greg Colbrunn <m0>(--) who lockers next to him. Abbott said the idea was his.<ep>
  (box) The U.S. Army's <m0>Jarret Behrens, <m0>22, of Coral Springs, threw out the first pitch Wednesday. He returns to Bosnia on Monday.<ql>
<m1>Court decides for Sheffield<ep>
<m0>   The mother of baseball star <m0>Gary Sheffield's <m0>10-year-old daughter will receive less than a third of the $170,000 per year in child support payments she sought, a Pinellas County judge ruled Tuesday.<ep>
   Sheffield was ordered to pay <m0>Davene Williams <m0>$3,500 per month in child support, and to provide his daughter, <m0>Ebony, <m0>with private school tuition, a college fund and medical expenses.<ep>
   The package, which totals nearly $50,000 per year, is what Sheffield volunteered to pay last November.<ql>
