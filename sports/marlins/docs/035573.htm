  If you see the Marlins lining up at the pharmacy this morning, get out of their way. They'll be looking for a dose of tetracycline. Let them have it.<P>

   Pass it around the dugout. Put extra doses in the clubhouse. Give the equipment manager a dose, too.<P>

   Never heard of tetracycline?<P>

   It's the stuff dreams and home runs are made of -- sort of. It has the Mar<BR>
lins seeing W's after beating the Mets, 6-3, Wednesday and could help this team see its way to turning around a season.<P>

   At least it felt that way Wednesday, thanks to Jeff Conine, who is seeing fine these days, thank you.<P>

   ``I saw that one pretty well,'' said Conine, referring to his three-run homer in the seventh that lifted Florida to its third victory in a row.<P>

   Conine's fourth home run in six games gave the Marlins a sweep to start what could be one of the most important homestands of the season. It's early, but jumping out to a 3-0 start on this 10-game homestand is just what the doctor ordered for the weak-hitting Marlins.<P>

   It's a good thing Conine's eye doctor ordered a prescription of tetracycline.<P>

   Conine, the All-Star MVP who was struggling as late as last week because he was having trouble seeing, started taking the antibiotic to help <BR>
his dry-eye problem just before the Marlins went to Denver. He went 6 for 10 in Colorado, and has gone 10 for 22 since, with four home runs.<P>

   None was bigger than Wednesday's.<P>

   ``Yeah, you could say that was the biggest hit I have had this year,'' said Conine, with a half-smile. ``We've got a ton of games here in May and June. It's a good time for us to make up some ground.'' Then he joked about his prescription. ``I'm sure baseball players are always looking for a good prescription if they think it will help them.''<P>

   Conine didn't have a hit until he stepped to the plate in the seventh and launched the first pitch he saw from reliever Doug Henry, who served up a slider that landed in the left-field seats. The Marlins, who have had trouble recognizing a home run with men on base, scored four runs in the inning and hung on with a bullpen that saw nothing but zeros in the late innings of the sweep. Robb Nen earned his third save in three nights and has seven for a team with 14 victories.<P>

   ``This was big,'' said Nen, who pitched a perfect ninth with one strikeout. ``This could get us going.''<P>

  The crowd of 21,357, the largest in two weeks, was on its feet for Nen. They were standing in the seventh for Conine, who felt he had to make up for an early mistake.<P>

Lance Johnson hit the first pitch of the night to left-center. Conine raced over and made the play, but the ball popped out of his glove and the Mets had a runner at second, the Marlins had an error, and John Burkett had a problem.<P>

  Jose Vizcaino's sacrifice bunt moved Johnson to third, but Burkett almost wiggled free when he struck out Bernard Gilkey. However, he fell behind Todd Hundley, 2-0, then paid for it as Hundley laced a double off the right-field wall. Rico Brogna then punched a single to left to put the Mets on top, 2-0.<P>

  ``I just plain missed it,'' Conine said. ``That's a play that shouldn't happen in the major leagues. But I got a little retribution. I got back one more run than I gave up.''<P>

<P>

   It was Florida's night. Kurt Abbott had to sit out because he is experiencing dizziness, but Alex Arias, who started in Abbott's place, ripped a homer in the third inning then tied the score in the sixth, 2-2, hitting a two-out, 3-2 pitch for a single. The single? It bounced off Jeff Kent's glove at third base.<P>

   Every night this week has belonged to the bullpen. Yorkis Perez entered with two out in the seventh and pitched just long enough to get his first victory since July 30, 1995.<P>

   Perez fell behind right-handed-hitting Hundley, 3-1, then put him on intentionally to pitch to Brogna with the bases loaded. Brogna struck out looking at a 1-2 pitch that hugged the outside corner. Terry Mathews pitched a perfect eighth before giving way to Nen. The three relief pitchers did not allow a hit.<P>

   Burkett, who gave up one earned run, deserved better.<P>

   ``I'm very happy,'' said Burkett, who is still 1-5. ``We won the game. That's what I'm here for. As far as the way I pitched . . . from the way I had been pitching, it was Cy Young-like. But compared to how I can pitch, it was average.''
