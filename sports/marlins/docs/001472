<m0>  SAN FRANCISCO (--) The Marlins, a team that has been held together by its pitching staff this season, feel they can still compete even if <m0>Alejandro Pen~a <m0>is forced to retire.<ep>
  Pen~a, 36, who is scheduled to get a second opinion on his strained rotator cuff injury Monday, might not recover. If he doesn't, Florida will have lost its setup man, but not its confidence.<ep>
  The key to losing Pen~a is not losing <m0>Jay Powell, <m0>who is also on the disabled list with a rib injury. Powell has been on the DL since April 20, but the Marlins expect him to take over the setup man role.<ep>
  Powell ``will be back,'' Marlins General Manager <m0>Dave Dombrowski <m0>said. ``Jay will be the setup man when he comes back.<ep>
  ``It was one of those things where we were trying not to rush Jay Powell this year. We thought he had the ability, but when you are trying to win, you don't want to have to do it with a rookie.''<ep>
  That's why the Marlins re-signed Pen~a, but even then they knew it was a risk.<ep>
  Florida's bullpen has been tough all season, giving up just three home runs in the first 23 games (tied with Atlanta for fewest in th NL). The bullpen has allowed just seven earned runs in the past 29 innings (2.17 ERA).<ep>
  ``When you have a <m0>Robb Nen, <m0>a <m0>Jay Powell, <m0>a <m0>Terry Mathews <m0>and a <m0>Dave Weathers, <m0>you are looking at a lot of strong arms,'' Dombrowski said.<ep>
  Manager <m0>Rene Lachemann <m0>said if Pen~a is lost, Florida loses a valuable commodity (--) experience.<ep>
  ``Our bullpen is extremely young,'' Lachemann said.<ql>
<m1>Rockies claim Beckett<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Pitcher <m0>Robbie Beckett, <m0>who was at Double A Portland, was claimed on waivers Friday by the the Rockies. The Marlins designated Beckett for reassignment Thursday in order to make room for <m0>Marquis Riley <m0>on their 40-man roster.<ep>
  Beckett wasn't with Florida long. The Marlins claimed him on waivers from San Diego at the end of spring training.<ep>
   The Marlins claimed Riley, who will play center field in Triple A Charlotte, on waivers from the Angels Thursday. Riley stole 69 bases two years ago in Double A.<ep>
  ``We're not looking at him to help our club right now,'' Dombrowski said. ``He is a lot like <m0>Jesus Tavarez. <m0>He is a switch-hitter, but a converted switch-hitter. He's a base-stealing threat. But he still needs to develop.''<ep>
  <m0>Darrell Whitmore <m0>has been playing center field in Charlotte along with <m0>Jason Robertson, <m0>but don't look for the Marlins to call up Whitmore to fill in at center field.<ep>
  ``We don't want Whitmore to come up and not play,'' Dombrowski said. ``This year we want him to play every day in Charlotte. That doesn't mean he might not come up later in the season.''<ql>
<m1>A proud Gardner<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  <m0>Mark Gardner <m0>was all smiles Friday as he ran into his old teammates. Gardner pitched a four-hit shutout for the Giants against Atlanta Thursday.<ep>
  Still, the Marlins don't have any regrets about releasing Gardner at the end of spring training.<ep>
  ``We made a decision the best way we could at the time,'' pitching coach <m0>Larry Rothschild <m0>said. ``It may work out best for everybody involved. You know he is capable of [pitching a shutout]. Look at the game [a shutout] he pitched for us against St. Louis last year.''<ql>
