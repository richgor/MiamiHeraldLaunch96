  They have been here before.<P>

   The Houston Rockets, who face the Seattle SuperSonics tonight in Game 3 of their second-round playoff series, are in the same playoff situation they were in against Phoenix the last two years before winning NBA titles: back home, down 2-0.<P>

   Against the Suns last year, the Rockets split at home to fall behind 3-1, but then won three straight to advance. The year before, they responded from the 2-0 deficit by winning three straight, and then won the decisive Game 7 to advance.<P>

   Houston guard Mario Elie, for one, thinks the Rockets will respond again.<P>

   ``They've got to play great like they did in Game 2, and that ain't going to happen too often,'' Elie said. ``I don't expect them to do that down here.''<P>

   After blowing out Houston in Game 1, the Sonics hit a playoff-record 20 of 27 3-pointers to win Game 2, 105-101. Also, Houston center Hakeem Olajuwon was hit with a $5,000 fine Wednesday for elbowing in Game 1, which should only intensify matters tonight.<P>

   ``Everybody knows they're going to come out with a great effort [tonight], maybe their best effort of the year,'' Sonics Coach George Karl said. ``We're going to have to play an awfully good basketball game.''<BR>
How to stop Shaq?<BR>
<P>

  Shaquille O'Neal played like a man with a score to settle against Christian Laettner Wednesday night.<P>

   He scored all right -- 41 points in the Magic's 117-105 victory over the Hawks in Game 1 of their second-round playoff series.<P>

   And so, heading into tonight's Game 2, helping Laettner stop O'Neal is the Hawks' first order of business.<P>

   ``We allowed him to get way too close to the basket,'' Atlanta Coach Lenny Wilkens said. ``It doesn't make any difference -- if he's that close, the double team cannot get there quick enough. We have to do a better job fighting him for his position.''<P>

   Said Laettner, who had just seven points of his own: ``Obviously it's very hard when they're throwing it in to him 50 times a game. It is tough.''
