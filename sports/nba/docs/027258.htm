   ORLANDO -- It didn't matter that Atlanta found a way to slow down Shaquille O'Neal. Orlando still had too much firepower Friday night and took a 2-0 lead in their second-round playoff series with a 120-94 victory.<P>

   O'Neal fought through the Hawks' aggressive double-teams to score 28 points, and Nick Anderson added 22 for the Magic, who led by more than 20 for most of the second half before Atlanta closed within 15 while Anfernee Hardaway was on the bench with strained hamstrings in both legs.<P>

   Games 3 and 4 of the best-of-seven matchup will be played Sunday and Monday in Atlanta. Hardaway's status for the weekend was not immediately clear.<P>

   The Magic have lost in six of their last seven games at the Omni. But provided Hardaway is healthy, the defending Eastern Conference champions will head north with confidence they can reverse that trend after winning eight of their last nine road games during the regular season.<P>

   ``We've still got room for improvement,'' said Dennis Scott, who rebounded from a subpar five-point performance in Game 1 to score 17 for the Magic. ``It may look easy, but it's not.''<P>

   All of Orlando's starters were in double figures by halftime, and the Magic led 96-68 before Atlanta's Mookie Blaylock hit two 3-pointers in a 13-0 run that trimmed Orlando's lead to 15 with 7:18 to go.<P>

   Blaylock led the Hawks with 25 points and Christian Laettner had 20 after being outscored by O'Neal 41-7 in Orlando's 117-105 victory in Game 1. Steve Smith had 18, but Stacey Augmon was held to two after pacing Atlanta with 23 in the opener.<P>

   Hardaway had 15 points and seven assists, while Horace Grant contributed 14 points and 11 rebounds for Orlando. Along with his 22 points, Anderson had six steals and five assists.<P>

   ``I try to play an all-around game,'' Anderson said. ``I know I'm the third or fourth option on offense, but I try to set the tone defensively and make the most of my scoring opportunities.''<P>

   The Magic shot 70 percent in the opening quarter and made 20 of their first 27 shots in building a 45-23 lead. An even better indication of how well things were going for the Magic was their perfect markmanship from the free-throw line (8-for-8) in the first half.<P>

   The Hawks went into the game feeling that they had to slow O'Neal with double-teams and make the Magic center work harder on defense by getting Laettner involved in the Atlanta offense.<P>

   The plan worked, but not well enough to make a difference.<P>

   When the Hawks made it tougher for O'Neal to get to the basket in the first quarter, the four-time All-Star did a good job of finding open shooters on the perimeter.<P>

   The Magic made five of seven 3-pointers in the opening half after going 5-for-16 from the same distance in Game 1. Meanwhile, Grant made six of eight shots in the first quarter and O'Neal scored 12 second-quarter points to finish the half with 16 on 6-for-8 shooting.<P>

   Laettner had 14 at the half after scoring only seven on Wednesday night. But with Orlando shooting so well, O'Neal wasn't forced to move out and try to shut down the Atlanta center.
