     David Robinson had 24 points and 12 rebounds and the Spurs used a late 15-3 run to beat the Utah Jazz, 88-77, Thursday night in San Antonio to even their second-round Western Conference playoff series at one game apiece.<ep>
   It was the lowest playoff point total ever for the Jazz, which scored just nine points in the first quarter.<ep>
   Game 3 in the best-of-seven series is Saturday in Salt Lake City. Utah won the opener, 95-75.<ep>
     The Jazz used a 15-4 run to cut the Spurs' lead to 73-71 on a jumper by Karl Malone with 3:13 left, but Robinson's three-point play sparked a 15-3 run that put San Antonio up, 88-74. Chuck Person capped the spurt with a three-point play with 9.8 seconds left.<ep>
   Utah coach Jerry Sloan was ejected with 1:50 remaining after arguing with the refs after a foul call against Malone.<ep>
   Malone led the Jazz with 24 points and eight rebounds, while Person had 16 points for the Spurs.<ep>
   San Antonio had a huge advantage at the foul line, making 21-of-29, compared to 4-of-5 for Utah. The Spurs also outrebounded the Jazz, 46-38.<ep>
     The Spurs opened the game with an 11-0 run and led, 25-9, after the first quarter. The Jazz shot just 24 percent in the period.<ep>
   San Antonio built it to 18 early in the second quarter on a driving basket by Vinny Del Negro, and held a 34-19 advantage following a jumper by Sean Elliott with 7:33 left in the half.<ep>
   But the Jazz then scored 14 straight points, pulling to 34-33 on a dunk by Adam Keefe off a fast-break pass by John Stockton. Will Perdue's dunk gave the Spurs a three-point lead, but Keefe made a hook shot and then hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give Utah its first lead of the game, 38-36 at halftime.<ep>
   Trailing, 52-51, in the third quarter, the Spurs went on 12-2 run to take a 63-54 lead going into the final period. Charles Smith capped the spurt with a tip-in with 1.4 seconds remaining.<ep>
   Person hit two 3-pointers early in the fourth quarter as the Spurs opened a 69-56 lead. But the Jazz countered with a 9-0 run, capped by Bryon Russell's 3-pointer to pull within four points.<ep>
   Russell scored 16 points for Utah and another reserve, Adam Keefe, had 11.<ep>
   The Spurs had a balanced scoring attack, with Sean Elliott getting 12 and Charles Smith and Del Negro 10 apiece.<ql>
