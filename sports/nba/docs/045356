   When there are three days off between playoff games, backs get stiff and tongues start to wag.<ep>
   The most serious stiff back belongs to Bulls forward <m0>Toni Kukoc, <m0>who suffered the injury during practice and was taken by ambulance to a hospital. He did not accompany the team to New York on Friday afternoon, and team doctor <m0>James Hefferon <m0>said he would miss Games 3 and 4.<ep>
   ``He was in a lot of pain, a lot of back spasms (--) so much so it was hard for him to even get up off the floor,'' Hefferon said.<ep>
   Knicks center <m0>Patrick Ewing's <m0>back was bothering him, too, and he did not participate fully as the Knicks practiced in suburban Purchase.<ep>
   All the while, the Knicks and Bulls kept sniping at each other Friday as their verbal battle off the court preceded Game 3 in the best-of-seven series.<ep>
   Chicago Coach <m0>Phil Jackson <m0>took a shot at Knicks Coach <m0>Jeff Van Gundy's <m0>substitution patterns, and Van Gundy accused Jackson of breaking another unwritten rule of coaching.<ep>
   The angry words between Bulls assistant coach <m0>Jim Cleamons <m0>and Ewing cost Cleamons $2,500 after the NBA decided he initiated a confrontation with the Knicks center during the fourth quarter of Game 2.<ep>
   Ewing's back was bothering him, too, and he did not participate fully as the Knicks practiced in suburban Purchase.<ep>
   After a week in which both teams were occupied with dissing one another, Jackson took a mild swipe at Van Gundy on Friday when asked why the Bulls have dominated the fourth quarters of Games 1 and 2.<ep>
   ``Well, you have to make substitutions in this game. You just can't play players consistently for 48 minutes, especially guys like <m0>[John] Starks <m0>and Ewing,'' Jackson said.<ep>
   The Knicks have had plenty to say about Jackson, too, accusing him of badgering the referees to get calls that no other team gets.<ep>
   Van Gundy, angered in March when Jackson publicly expressed interest in coaching the Knicks next season, made a point Friday of saying Jackson was again crossing the boundary of what an NBA coach should say publicly.<ep>
   ``To tell you the truth, I've never seen any other coaches talk derogatorily about another team,'' he said. ``I think only players might talk that way in direct correlation to how good they are. But that's OK. In many ways, they've earned the right to do and say whatever they want until somebody beats them.''<ql>
<m0>Mavericks talk to Westphal<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The Mavericks contacted former Phoenix Suns head coach <m0>Paul Westphal <m0>for an interview.<ep>
   Westphal last night joined Mavericks assistant <m0>Brad Davis <m0>as the first two candidates contacted from a list that sources say includes the University of Kentucky's <m0>Rick Pitino, <m0>Chicago Bulls assistant <m0>Jim Cleamons <m0>and Indiana Pacers head coach <m0>Larry Brown.<m0><ep>
   Westphal said he talked to director of player personnel Grant and president <m0>Norm Sonju <m0>and expects to come to Dallas for a meeting that Westphal refused to reveal specifics about.<ep>
   ``I'm flattered they want to talk to me,'' Westphal said from his Phoenix home, ``and I'm glad to be talking to them.''<ql>
<m0>Dampier declares for draft<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Mississippi State junior center <m0>Erick Dampier <m0>declared his eligibility for the NBA draft, but said he is leaving open the possibility of returning to the Bulldogs next season.<ep>
   In a statement released by Mississippi State, the 6-foot-11, 265-pound Dampier said he was submitting his name for the June 26 draft ``in order to begin gathering information about my possible draft position.''<ep>
   ``I have no intentions of signing with an agent in the meantime, so that I may leave my options completely open about the possibility of returning to Mississippi State for my senior season,'' said Dampier, a two-time All-Southeastern Conference pick.<ep>
