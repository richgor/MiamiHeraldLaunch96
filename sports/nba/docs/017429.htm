   NEW YORK -- Believe it or not, the Chicago Bulls can indeed be beaten -- even with Michael Jordan at his amazing best.<P>

   The New York Knicks proved that Saturday, overcoming Jordan's 46 points and incredible late-game heroics for a 102-99 overtime victory that cut Chicago's lead to 2-1 in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series.<P>

   ``I never figured we were invincible,'' Jordan said after Chicago's first loss of the postseason. ``If there was an aura around us because of the 72 games we won in the regular season, I don't think [the players] felt that way.''<P>

   Game 4 is late today, and Game 5 will be Tuesday night at Chicago.<P>

   ``We're disappointed and tired, and we expended a lot of energy,'' Jordan said. ``We wanted to sweep, but we still have an opportunity to win one game here.''<P>

   Like so many Knicks-Bulls games in past playoffs, this one was quite memorable. New York controlled the game until the final minute and a half, when Jordan, helped by two critical Knicks turnovers, erased an eight-point deficit all by himself.<P>

   But Jordan wasn't able to free himself for a good shot at the end of regulation, and passed the ball off at the end of overtime when Chicago needed a three-pointer to tie. Scottie Pippen ended up getting an open shot just before the buzzer, but it bounced off the front of the rim.<P>

   The Knicks were jubilant as they walked off the court, knowing they can tie the series if they can pull off another upset.<P>

   ``We beat a great team,'' Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I don't think our guys get enough credit for being resilient. I really respect how they bounced back and made big plays.''<P>

   John Starks led New York with 30 points, seven in overtime. Patrick Ewing overcame his fourth-quarter no-shows of Games 1 and 2 and finished with 22 points and 13 rebounds, and his jumper over Luc Longley with 38 seconds to play in overtime gave New York the lead for good, 98-97.<P>

   Jordan had the ball tipped away by Charles Oakley on the Bulls' next possession, and he fouled Starks after the ball got away. Starks calmly made two free throws for a 100-97 lead, and the Knicks gave up an uncontested dunk to Pippen with 13 seconds remaining.<P>

   Oakley was fouled two seconds later and made both free throws, forcing the Bulls to try a three-pointer for the tie. Jordan was double-covered and threw a crosscourt pass to Pippen, whose shot was short.<P>

   Pippen had 24 points and four three-pointers, but he and Jordan were the only Bulls to score in double figures.<P>

   ``We're totally out of sync offensively, and I find myself bailing the team out because of it,'' Jordan said. ``I don't think we're shooting the ball with a lot of confidence, and you need confidence at this time of the year.''<P>

   Anthony Mason had 18 points and 10 rebounds, Oakley had 13 points and 13 rebounds, and Charlie Ward came off the bench to score 12 points for New York.
