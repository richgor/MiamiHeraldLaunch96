<m0>   While eight NBA teams play on, the other 21 try to figure out how they can still be on the court this time next year.<ep>
   An update on the Eastern Conference teams which have finished their seasons other than the Heat:<ep>
  <m0>(box) Boston: <m0>The Celtics are overloaded at guard and would like to move <m0>Dee Brown <m0>for frontcourt help. Talks with Golden State about <m0>Eric Montross <m0>for <m0>Rony Seikaly <m0>could be revived. Celtics want to keep guard <m0>Greg Minor <m0>and forward <m0>Pervis Ellison, <m0>who both can opt for free <m4>  <m2><ql>
<m0>agency.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Charlotte: <m0>The Hornets are not hurrying to hire a coach, perhaps hoping to lure <m0>George Karl <m0>when the Sonics' season is over. Karl's contract is expiring, but he's likely to stay put if Seattle keeps advancing in the playoffs. Bulls assistant <m0>Jim Cleamons <m0>and former Celtics coach <m0>Chris Ford <m0>also are options.<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Priority is re-signing free-agent point guard <m0>Kenny Anderson <m0>and acquiring a defensive-minded big man. <m0>Darrin Hancock <m0>and <m0>Anthony Goldwire <m0>are free agents.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Cleveland: <m0>Cavs need a center with more offensive skills than <m0>Michael Cage, <m0>who can opt for free agency. Forward <m0>Tyrone Hill, <m0>who complained about inconsistent playing time, could be dealt. Cleveland would like to keep unsigned swingman <m0>Dan Majerle.<m0><ep>
   <m0>(box) Detroit: <m0>The Pistons, who have considerable room under the salary cap, badly need a center and a young point guard. They may target free agent <m0>Jim McIlvaine, <m0>Washington's ace shot-blocker, and Nets free-agent point guard <m0>Chris Childs. <m0>Former University of Michigan forward <m0>Juwan Howard <m0>also will be courted.<ep>
   Two key starters will be free agents (--) guard <m0>Allan Houston, <m0>who says he wants to stay, and power forward <m0>Otis Thorpe, <m0>who has expressed interest in the Heat.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Indiana: <m0>Pacers reportedly are close to re-signing forwards <m0>Antonio Davis <m0>and <m0>Dale Davis <m0>but will have competition from the Knicks and others for <m0>Reggie Miller. <m0>(Reggie's sister, TNT announcer <m0>Cheryl Miller, <m0>says her brother prefers to stay in Indiana.)<ep>
   <m0>(box) Milwaukee: <m0>GM <m0>Mike Dunleavy <m0>will make a push for a free-agent center (McIlvaine, <m0>Brian Williams) <m0>and a free-agent shooter (perhaps <m0>Steve Smith, Tracy Murray). <m0>Free agents <m0>Kevin Duckworth, Benoit Benjamin <m0>will not be brought back; unsigned <m0>Terry Cummings <m0>might be. Coaching possibilities include the Bulls' Cleamons and the University of Cincinnati's <m0>Bob Huggins.<m0><ep>
   <m0>(box) New Jersey: <m0>Nets want to retain free agents Childs, <m0>Armon Gilliam <m0>and <m0>P.J. Brown <m0>and add another scorer. Spurned by <m0>Rick Pitino, <m0>the Nets say they have not begun interviews for the coaching job.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Philadelphia: <m0>New GM <m0>Brad Greenberg <m0>might replace Coach <m0>John Lucas <m0>and likely will shuffle the roster. Free agents include <m0>Richard Dumas, Tony Massenburg, Vernon Maxwell<m0> and <m0>Trevor Ruffin.<m0><ep>
   <m0>(box) Toronto: <m0>New Coach <m0>Darrell Walker <m0>will be more willing than ousted <m0>Brendan Malone <m0>to play younger players. Raptors will try to keep free agents <m0>Oliver Miller <m0>and Murray, and add a defensive presence in the frontcourt.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Washington: <m0>New GM <m0>Wes Unseld <m0>will try to keep Howard, who says he would stay if the money is suitable. Bullets likely will lose McIlvaine, but will try to keep one of their free-agent point guards, preferably <m0>Robert Pack <m0>and/or <m0>Brent Price <m0>over <m0>Mark Price.<m0><ql>
<m0>Loughery to stay with Heat<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Former Heat coach <m0>Kevin Loughery <m0>said he will remain in the club's front office for the final year of his contract rather than pursue one of several vacant coaching jobs. Loughery's title is vice president of player personnel, but he is essentially an Atlanta-based scout.<ep>
   Loughery scouted about 25 college games this season. ``I'm not sure if I want to coach again,'' he said. ``I had a good time this year.''<ep>
   (box) Heat Executive Vice President <m0>Dave Wohl <m0>said he expects New York to pass on Atlanta's No. 1 draft choice, which would allow Miami to keep its second-round choice, No. 45 overall in the June 26 draft. The Heat acquired Atlanta's No. 1 pick in the <m0>Kevin Willis <m0>deal but dealt it to New York as compensation for hiring <m0>Pat Riley.<m0><ep>
   The Knicks must decide by mid-June whether to take the Hawks' pick this year or delay it at least another year. Atlanta will get Miami's No. 2 pick in the draft in which New York uses the Hawks' No. 1. Miami previously traded its top pick (No. 16 overall) to Charlotte in the <m0>Alonzo Mourning <m0>deal.<ql>
