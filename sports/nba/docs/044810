<m0>  They have been here before.<ep>
   The Houston Rockets, who face the Seattle SuperSonics tonight in Game 3 of their second-round playoff series, are in the same playoff situation they were in against Phoenix the last two years before winning NBA titles: back home, down 2-0.<ep>
   Against the Suns last year, the Rockets split at home to fall behind 3-1, but then won three straight to advance. The year before, they responded from the 2-0 deficit by winning three straight, and then won the decisive Game 7 to advance.<ep>
   Houston guard <m0>Mario Elie, <m0>for one, thinks the Rockets will respond again.<ep>
   ``They've got to play great like they did in Game 2, and that ain't going to happen too often,'' Elie said. ``I don't expect them to do that down here.''<ep>
   After blowing out Houston in Game 1, the Sonics hit a playoff-record 20 of 27 3-pointers to win Game 2, 105-101. Also, Houston center <m0>Hakeem Olajuwon <m0>was hit with a $5,000 fine Wednesday for elbowing in Game 1, which should only intensify matters tonight.<ep>
   ``Everybody knows they're going to come out with a great effort [tonight], maybe their best effort of the year,'' Sonics Coach <m0>George Karl<m0> said. ``We're going to have to play an awfully good basketball game.''<ql>
<m0>How to stop Shaq?<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  <m0>Shaquille O'Neal <m0>played like a man with a score to settle against <m0>Christian Laettner <m0>Wednesday night.<ep>
   He scored all right (--) 41 points in the Magic's 117-105 victory over the Hawks in Game 1 of their second-round playoff series.<ep>
   And so, heading into tonight's Game 2, helping Laettner stop O'Neal is the Hawks' first order of business.<ep>
   ``We allowed him to get way too close to the basket,'' Atlanta Coach <m0>Lenny Wilkens <m0>said. ``It doesn't make any difference (--) if he's that close, the double team cannot get there quick enough. We have to do a better job fighting him for his position.''<ep>
   Said Laettner, who had just seven points of his own: ``Obviously it's very hard when they're throwing it in to him 50 times a game. It is tough.''<ql>
