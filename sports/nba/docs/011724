<m0>  No wonder they won 72 regular-season games. For the first time in 13 years, three members of the same team (--) Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls (--) were named to the NBA's all-defensive team.<ep>
   ``It's what made us a good team this year even though our offense led the league,'' Coach Phil Jackson said. ``We got a lot of offense off our defense.''<ep>
   They were joined on the first team by Seattle's Gary Payton and San Antonio's David Robinson. Payton earlier was selected the league's defensive player of the year.<ep>
   Pippen received 55 of a possible 56 points in voting by 29 NBA coaches, who were not allowed to vote for their own players. Jordan received 53 points, Payton 48, Robinson 42 and Rodman 30.<ep>
   Only one member of the Heat received points: Alonzo Mourning, with four.<ep>
   All five first-teamers have made the team before. It is the seventh selection for Jordan and Rodman, fifth for Pippen, fourth for Robinson and third for Payton.<ql>
