   Detlef Schrempf and Gary Payton each scored 28 points, and Shawn Kemp got a key dunk and two free throws down the stretch as Seattle beat host Houston 115-112 Friday night, putting the defending NBA champions within one game of elimination.<P>

   Seattle beat the Rockets for the 12th consecutive time to take a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series. Game 4 will be Sunday at The Summit.<P>

   The Rockets rallied from 0-2 deficits the past two seasons in the conference semifinals, but no team has ever recovered from an 0-3 hole.<P>

   Seattle took a 112-105 lead on Schrempf's two free throws with 52 seconds to play before Houston made a final surge.<P>

   Mario Elie, standing five feet behind the arc, hit a fadeaway three-pointer to cut the Sonics' lead to 113-112 with 11 seconds remaining. Payton made two free throws to make it 115-112 with 10 seconds to go, and Houston came down with a chance to tie it with a three-pointer.<P>

   But Elie missed a long three-pointer, and Seattle's Sam Perkins grabbed the rebound to clinch the victory for Seattle.<P>

   Clyde Drexler led the Rockets with 28 points, and Kenny Smith had 27, including 5 of 10 from three-point range. Kemp scored 21 points for the Sonics.<P>

   Hakeem Olajuwon had 24 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists for Houston. Kemp had 18 rebounds for Seattle.<P>

   The score was tied three times in the fourth quarter, the last at 97-97 on a pair of free throws by Smith. But Hersey Hawkins scored on a fastbreak layup, and Kemp stole a pass from Olajuwon and dribbled the length of the court for a dunk with 4:33 to play for a 101-97 lead. The Rockets never got the lead again.<BR>
<LI> Magic 120, Hawks 94<BR>
HARDAWAY HURT<BR>
   ORLANDO -- It didn't matter that Atlanta found a way to slow down Shaquille O'Neal. Orlando still had too much firepower Friday night and took a 2-0 lead in their second-round playoff series with a 120-94 victory.<P>

   O'Neal fought through the Hawks' aggressive double-teams to score 28 points and Nick Anderson added 22 for the Magic, who led by more than 20 for most of the second half before Atlanta closed within 15 while Anfernee Hardaway was on the bench with strained hamstrings in both legs.<P>

   Games 3 and 4 of the best-of-seven matchup will be played Sunday and Monday in Atlanta. Hardaway's status for the weekend was not immediately clear.<P>

   The Magic have lost in six of their last seven games at the Omni. But provided Hardaway is healthy, the defending Eastern Conference champions will head north with confidence they can reverse that trend after winning eight of their last nine road games during the regular season.<P>

   All of Orlando's starters were in double figures by halftime, and the Magic led 96-68 before Atlanta's Mookie Blaylock hit two 3-pointers in a 13-0 run that trimmed Orlando's lead to 15 with 7:18 to go.<P>

   Blaylock led the Hawks with 25 points and Christian Laettner had 20 after being outscored by O'Neal 41-7 in Orlando's 117-105 victory in Game 1. Steve Smith had 18, but Stacey Augmon was held to two after pacing Atlanta with 23 in the opener.<P>

   Dennis Scott, rebounding from a subpar five-point performance in Game 1, scored 17 for Orlando. Hardaway had 15 points and seven assists, while Horace Grant contributed 14 points and 11 rebounds for Orlando.
