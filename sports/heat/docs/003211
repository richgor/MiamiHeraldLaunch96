  The season began with a thumbs-up gesture in a deafening arena last November, flashed across the court by Heat owner Micky Arison to Coach Pat Riley. It ended quietly Wednesday, Riley standing with his arms folded, grimly overseeing the death of his team's season. It was fitting: Riley wore a solid black suit.<ep>
  The Bulls passed through Miami like a train in the night, pausing briefly (--) perhaps on the way to history (--) for a 112-91 defeat.<ep>
  By late in the second quarter, Miami's only chance for victory seemed by following the instructions on the sign waved by that nutty fan (--) it said ``Heat.'' But when he flipped over the left end, he added a ``C'' for ``Cheat.''<ep>
  Having wrapped up their first-round playoff series with three straight victories over the Heat, the Bulls will move on to face the Knicks in the conference semifinals. Chicago, which won a league-record 72 games this season, will get on with the work of proving it is the best team in NBA history.<ep>
  ``I don't want to sit here, and I don't want my players to sit in there [the locker room] and wallow in what obviously was total domination by the Bulls,'' Riley said. ``I want to give them credit. They are on a mission. I can't see anybody getting in their way at all.''<ep>
  A couple of Chicago's players, John Salley and Steve Kerr among them, waited for Heat players at center court as if awaiting congratulations. The Heat filed quickly into the locker room. Salley cursed at Miami's players, who insisted it wasn't a snub.<ep>
   ``I didn't know we were supposed to shake hands on the court,'' guard Rex Chapman said. ``I saw some guys and wished them luck back here.''<ep>
  Heat players will begin their vacations. Riley will shift his focus from coach to team president, and he will begin reconstructing a team that has only three players with contracts for next year (--) Kurt Thomas, Keith Askins, and Sasha Danilovic.<ep>
  The Heat did not go out Wednesday in a blaze of glory. In fact, throughout the best-of-five series against the Bulls, Miami looked like a flashlight trying to outshine the sun. The Heat retooled its roster Feb. 22, then squeaked into the playoffs on the third-to-last day of the season, winning the eighth seed.<ep>
  The top-seeded Bulls brought out their best game Wednesday, and the Heat looked low on batteries. Even Chris Gatling, who is nicknamed The Energizer and has an Energizer Bunny painted on the back of his sport-utility vehicle, couldn't keep the season going. He scored three points.<ep>
  Bulls Coach Phil Jackson ``has simply put together a machine that is incredibly in sync,'' Riley said. ``When we voted for Coach of the Year, I voted for Phil.''<ep>
  Miami trailed by 14 at the end of the first quarter and by 22 midway through the second. Throughout the season, the Heat's reputation had been playing great defense. Wednesday, Miami didn't defend or rebound according to expectation. After Sunday's loss, Riley said his team played ``soft.'' Wednesday, the Heat looked like a team ready to go home.<ep>
  ``They are good,'' Chapman said. ``They have a lot of weapons, and not only that, they play hard. The thing that is most upsetting to me is I feel we were outplayed. That is hard to take.''<ep>
  The Bulls made 50 percent of their shots. They outrebounded the Heat, 48 to 38.<ep>
  Alonzo Mourning led the Heat with 30 points, but his offense never mattered. Tim Hardaway added 14 points and six assists. Askins had 13. For the Bulls, Scottie Pippen recorded a triple-double, scoring 22 and collecting 18 rebounds and 10 assists. Michael Jordan scored 26.<ep>
  The Miami Arena crowd, which greeted Miami with thunderous support and a ``Let's go, Heat!'' chant to start the game, was so bored in the fourth quarter it began cheering: ``Let's go, Panthers.'' The crowd was extending its support to the only South Florida team alive in the playoffs.<ep>
  Still, it had been a season worth cheering. Miami won 42 games, tying a team record. With a new coach and new players by the dozen, the Heat set a tone for a better future. The roster, however, is likely to be redone this summer. Of the Heat's free agents, only Mourning seems certain to be back.<ep>
  Hardaway and Gatling might be back. Chapman might return.<ep>
  Many decisions await Riley this summer.<ep>
  The work of coaching ended Wednesday night.<ql>
