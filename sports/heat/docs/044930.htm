  Bulls forward Dennis Rodman remains in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Rodman's most recent escapades came Sunday night after the Bulls' 31-point defeat of the Heat.<P>

   Rodman showed up for his post-game television show, which he has done all season with Chicago's NBC affiliate, in a policeman's jersey. Having invited Jay Leno on the show to celebrate Leno's birthday, Rodman brought Leno a cake -- then put his face into it.<P>

   Rodman also had comments on a variety of subjects:<P>

   He said the obscene gesture he made after being ejected Sunday was directed at Heat Coach Pat Riley -- not the officials.<P>

   ``I told Pat Riley: `Go to hell, baby,' '' Rodman said.<P>

   About slapping Heat center Alonzo Mourning in the face as Mourning went up for a shot, Rodman said: ``Believe me, the next shot I'm going to take is at somebody's throat.''<P>

   Rodman was fined $5,000 for the obscene gesture Sunday, giving him a total of $216,000 in fines and lost salary for suspended games this season.<P>

   Rodman will not talk to reporters who cover the NBA until his new book comes out. He will appear on the front cover of the book, sitting naked on a motorcycle with a basketball covering his groin. The back cover is the back of Rodman -- completely naked.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  Backup Heat center Danny Schayes, who played in Friday's game, will not play tonight because of fractures in the right side of his face. Schayes suffered the injury during practice April 23, during the Heat's playoff mini-camp.<P>

   When the injury did not improve, the Heat decided Schayes should have a CAT scan, which was performed Tuesday and revealed the fractures.<P>

   <LI> The Bulls, who fly to Miami today, will be staying in the same hotel as a few of the five Heat players acquired in the Feb. 22 trades have been staying. Riley said he has not prohibited his players from mingling with Chicago's players.<P>

   In fact, Riley joked, he decided to take advantage of knowing where the Bulls would be.<P>

   ``We have listening devices in the Bulls rooms,'' Riley said. ``We have a number of things set up to find out what the Bulls are saying. There was a plan to all this.''<P>

   <LI> Guard Tim Hardaway on the Bulls: ``They think we are a joke. We're not a joke. They were dissing us a lot. It's going to come back to hurt them.''<P>

   <LI> Mourning on his altercation with Bulls guard Ron Harper during halftime of Sunday's game (Mourning shoved a towel in Harper's face after Harper stopped to joke around with Heat guard Jeff Malone):<P>

   ``If I really wanted to punch him, I could have hauled off and punched him,'' Mourning said. ``But it wasn't about that. After the game, he came up to me and my fiancee. We shook hands.''<P>

   <LI> Mourning on whether the fans at tonight's game cheer for the Heat -- or the popular Bulls, whom Riley called ``America's team'':<P>

   ``I really don't care who they root for,'' Mourning said. ``Everywhere Chicago goes, Michael [Jordan] gets the applause because he has earned it. That won't surprise me.''
