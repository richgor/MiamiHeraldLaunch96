<m0>  Talk to Bulls center Luc Longley, and he will tell you how predictable Heat center Alonzo Mourning is. Talk to Bulls Coach Phil Jackson, and he will tell you how frustrated Mourning seems. Forward Scottie Pippen might be out of ammunition; he made fun of Mourning all last week.<ep>
   Talk to Mourning, and you will see a very, very proud man as close to being humbled as he has ever been in his four-year career.<ep>
   Close, but not quite there.<ep>
   ``This is a <m0>learning<m0>  experience,'' Mourning said after a workout Tuesday. ``It's not humbling at all.''<ep>
   If Mourning's performances have been about learning and not humility, then he must be a student at the School of Hard Knocks. The Heat is 0-2 in its best-of-five series against the Bulls, which resumes tonight at Miami Arena (--) and could end with a Bulls victory.<ql>
<m1><styl>cxon<ql>
<m2> <ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   So far in the series, Mourning has looked like a flag on a tragic day: flying at half-staff.<ql>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   He has averaged 12.0 points in the two playoff games. During the season, he averaged 23.2 points.<ep>
   He has averaged 5.0 rebounds. During the season, he averaged 10.4.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   He has one block. During the season, he averaged 2.7.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   You might see failure in those statistics. Mourning sees nothing of the sort. He views his two <m1> <m0>poor outings as obstacles interfering (--) only temporarily (--) with his otherwise clear view to success.<ep>
   ``That's why they brought me down here,'' Mourning said. ``That's why when we play, the camera is always on me. You picture me as a franchise player, and that's why I have to step up to the challenge. I haven't stepped up to that challenge yet.<ep>
   ``I've got to give credit to the Bulls defense, but I have to adjust my game and play through that. That's why I am the franchise player. I will learn from this, and it will make me a better player.''<ep>
   Heat Coach Pat Riley has been unruffled by his superstar's slump. Riley, who seems more concerned with Mourning's psyche than his playoff statistics, even had a good laugh at Longley's expense.<ep>
   Riley responded to the Australian-born Longley's assertion that Chicago has ``the book on Mourning.''<ep>
   ``He's just a big old bloke from Australia,'' Riley said. ``That's a bloke statement. Alonzo is predictable at 24 points per game and 10 rebounds per game. His season spoke for itself.<ep>
   ``I would love to put [Mourning and Longley] in a one-on-one game. That's like me as a player saying something about Jerry West. The guys that really deliver every night don't say much.''<ep>
   The Bulls have shown Mourning a new defensive look, specially designed to shut him down (--) and shut him up. Mourning averaged 18.5 points and 11 rebounds in four regular-season games against the Bulls.<ep>
   In 13 career playoff games with Charlotte (including four against Chicago), Mourning averaged 23.2 points and 10.9 rebounds.<ep>
   For this first-round series, the Bulls came out with a collapsing defensive scheme that looks a lot like a zone. <m1> <m0>Riley described it as a ``five-on-three.'' All of Chicago's defenders swarm to the ball, essentially ignoring the two offensive players on the other side (the weak side).<ep>
   ``They've got a good defense,'' guard Rex Chapman said, ``and not only that, but guys with long arms, lanky guys that get in the passing lanes and help out even when they are not double-teaming.''<ep>
   When Mourning gets the ball, the Bulls wait, wait, wait until he puts it on the floor before double-teaming him. Longley's job? To get in Mourning's way until help arrives.<ep>
   At 7-2, it is easy for Longley to get in the way.<ep>
   Added Chapman: ``Everybody knows Michael [Jordan] roams, and Scottie does a little, too. To me they get away with illegal defense more than other teams.''<ep>
   The Heat is not used to such slow double-teaming. Most teams send their double-teams right away (--) or not at all. It's the in-between, teeming approach that has been suffocating.<ep>
   Riley wants better perimeter shooting and more movement from the players that don't have the ball, giving Mourning more targets.<ep>
   And, oh yeah, Riley also would like to see more patience from Mourning and a determination to do more than score.<ep>
   ``When somebody zeros in on you, there are other things you can do to help the team,'' Riley said. ``Players have a tendency to take themselves out of a whole game when their game isn't going.''<ep>
   Mourning seems determined to get his game going again tonight.<ep>
   ``I'm a fighter,'' Mourning said. ``I am not going to give up.''<ql>
