<m0>   Heat center Alonzo Mourning underwent outpatient surgery Monday to repair a chronic dislocation problem on the ring finger of his left hand.<ep>
   Mourning had a damaged ligament in the finger that caused it to dislocate several times, most recently during a playoff game against Chicago.<ep>
   Mourning's finger will be in a splint for about three weeks, at which time he will begin rehabilitating. A full recovery is expected.<ep>
   Mourning is a free agent but has said he likely will remain with the Heat. Because of salary cap reasons, the Heat likely will not re-sign Mourning until after it has formulated most of the rest of its roster (--) probably in August.<ql>
