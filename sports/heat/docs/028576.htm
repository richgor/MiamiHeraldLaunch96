  With the season's games out of the way, Heat Coach Pat Riley can bring out his other title. Henceforth, we shall call him President Pat Riley.<P>

  Armed with a stacks of statistics and a thick list of phone numbers, and briefed by vice presidents Randy Pfund and Dave Wohl, Riley will begin Phase Two of his job. Especially after the free-agency period opens July 1, Riley will try to diagram the most intricate play of the year:<P>

   His roster for next season.<P>

  Only three Heat players are under contract. Kurt Thomas, who concluded the season by fracturing the right side of Danny Schayes' face with a punch in practice, Keith Askins and Sasha Danilovic will be back. Signing Alonzo Mourning will be priority No. 1. Beyond that, nothing is certain.<P>

  There are numerous ways Riley can spend Heat owner Micky Arison's money. What follows is an attempt to steal notes from Pfund and Wohl -- both of whom declined to give away their strategic ideas -- to give you an idea of what could be ahead for the Heat. (Each <BR>
theory contains the built-in assumption that the Heat will sign Mourning).<BR>
<LI> Theory 1: Get the Top Player Available<P>

   The player: Juwan Howard, Washington.<P>

   The good: Howard has a reputation as a nice guy and a hard worker. He is only 23, and would fill the Heat's void at small forward if Walt Williams opts for free agency (his agent says he will -- the Heat hopes so). Unlike Williams, Howard has a multi-dimensional game.<P>

   The bad: Howard would mean the Heat could not afford any other prominent free agents. He could cost $11 million or so a year, which would mean $8 million -- or more -- against next year's cap. That might not leave enough to sign Tim Hardaway, let alone Chris Gatling or Rex Chapman.<BR>
<LI> Theory 2: Get the Top Point Guard Available<P>

   The player: Gary Payton, Seattle.<P>

   The good: Payton is an All-Star point guard who led the league in steals and is at the top of his game. He turns 28 in July. Heat announcer Jack Ramsay recently said Payton is the best defensive player in the game.<P>

  The bad: Payton would likely take up $5 million-$6 million in cap room next season, absolutely, positively preventing the Heat from getting Howard. Hardaway would certainly go elsewhere if Payton joined the Heat. Payton seems to be leaning toward staying in Seattle.<BR>
<LI> Theory 3: Forget Payton, Re-sign Hardaway<P>

  The player: Hardaway, Miami.<P>

  The good: For 31 games, Hardaway fit well in Riley's system. Though older (29) and shorter (6-0 to 6-4) than Payton, Hardaway is happy in Miami and wants to remain. He might be 50 percent cheaper than Payton.<P>

   The bad: Hardaway has a pronounced size disadvantage against a number of Eastern Conference point guards. Orlando's Penny Hardaway and Chicago's Michael Jordan (when he plays point guard) are much taller and could post Hardaway up mercilessly.<BR>
<LI> Theory 4: Get a Big Power Forward to Take the Pressure off Mourning<P>

  The players: Elden Campbell, Los Angeles; Antonio Davis, Indiana; Dale Davis, Indiana; Horace Grant, Orlando; Dennis Rodman, Chicago; Otis Thorpe, Detroit; others. Some would even throw Denver center Dikembe Mutombo into the power forward mix.<P>

  The good: A hulking power forward would help Mourning, who is smaller than all of the NBA's top centers, offensively as well as defensively. Mourning was at his best with Larry Johnson nearby.<P>

  The bad: As useful as a big power forward would be, the Heat's dire needs are elsewhere -- namely, point guard and small forward.<BR>
<LI> Theory 5: Get Leadership and a Future Hall-of-Famer<P>

  The player: Magic Johnson, Los Angeles.<P>

  The good: Johnson could fill the hole at small forward and would probably not cost much. The Heat could probably afford Johnson and Payton, as well as a handful of other less-prominent but high-quality players.<P>

  The bad: Johnson's age (37 in August) and his disease, the HIV-virus, present concerns about how long he can perform at a high level.<BR>
<LI> Theory 6: Keep Your Own Free Agents<P>

  The players: Hardaway, Gatling, Chapman and Williams.<P>

  The good: The Heat finished the season 19-11 after overhauling its roster Feb. 22. Hardaway, Gatling, Chapman and Williams all contributed.<P>

  The bad: As impressively as the Heat concluded the regular season, the Bulls' three-and-out dismissal of Miami in the first round of the playoffs made it clear that this current Heat group -- as plucky as it was -- is a long way from a championship.<P>

  The Heat will have between $10 million and $13.6 million to spend on free agents besides Mourning. Mourning will probably get a deal that provides him with enough to buy a couple of Riley's new $6 million Coral Gables mansions per year.<P>

  The rest of Arison's money . . . <P>

  How would you spend it?
