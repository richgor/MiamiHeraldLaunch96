   After the final workout of seven grueling days of two non-contact camps, Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson walked off the practice field Thursday exuding confidence in a football team on which he has stamped his signature.<P>

  Said Johnson, trying to be diplomatic but not doing a very good job: ``It's hard for me to talk much about the way the team was before I got here, but I think they're a better football team today than they were couple months ago. I think they're a better football team today than what they were a month before I took the job.''<P>

   Miami's Midas.<P>

   In one week -- three days with veterans and rookies, four with vets only -- Johnson has seen promise in players skeptics deemed not good enough and enthusiasm in a team that was often labeled lethargic.<P>

   Of course, he will take credit for some of that. He pushed players very hard and gave them fair warning they might be job hunting if they don't do things his way.<P>

   ``I was telling Terrell Buckley I need 11 good men,'' Johnson said of his on-field conversation with one of the Dolphins' more maligned players. ``He said, `And some great ones.' I said, `If the good ones work hard enough, they will be great.' ''<P>

   Besides the teaching and learning of new schemes and the running of sprints, this camp also was a feeling-out process between players and coach. The most clear message: Johnson will take care of his players if they take care of him.<P>

   Because players hustled and worked through pain and injuries, he finished off practice with a barbecue and he gave them next week off. He even excused quarterback Dan Marino from practice Thursday so he could play in a celebrity golf tournament in Dallas -- that doesn't start until today. And to think, the most recent four-day session was called quarterback camp.<P>

  The Dolphins' next series of practices will be June 3-7. Training camp begins July 15.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  The Dolphins and the agent for first-round pick Daryl Gardener are discussing a five-year contract for the defensive tackle from Baylor. Financial terms have not been revealed, but a hefty signing bonus would seem probable because Gardener would be forfeiting a year of free agency.<P>

   As far as the Dolphins are concerned, a five-year deal is also salary-cap friendly because the signing bonus is prorated over the length of the contract.<P>

   Gardener is expected to be under contract by the June 3 mini-camp, but he is not expected to return to South Florida until he is signed -- a change of heart from Gardener, who said he planned to return this week to house shop.<P>

   The Dolphins said initial offers would be tendered to all rookies by this weekend or early next week.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  Tom Heckert Sr. and other high-ranking Dolphins' front office personnel have been retained by Johnson, who doubles as Miami's general manager. Some duties have been adjusted, but there were no drastic moves. It was initially presumed that some operations employees, such as Heckert, may be replaced.<P>

   Some scouts may be reassigned or let go, but that decision has yet to be made, Johnson said Wednesday.<P>

   Heckert, entering his eighth season with Miami, has been moved from Vice President of Player Personnel to Director of Pro Scouting. Bob Ackles, who came to the Dolphins from Philadelphia, is the Director of Football Operations.<P>

   Tom Braatz, in his fifth season with the Dolphins, will remain as Director of College Scouting and will receive assistance from Tom Heckert Jr., who, in his sixth year with Miami, will work in the pro and college scouting departments.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  Kicker Pete Stoyanovich will stage his first Celebrity Golf Classic next Friday at the Lago Mar Country Club in Plantation, with proceeds benefiting the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.<P>

  Stoyanovich's cousin, Mimi Stoyanovich, died from cystic fibrosis a few years ago.<P>

  Several South Florida athletes are expected to participate. The public is also welcome to play. After the tournament, a live and silent auction will be held.<P>

   For more information, call Jean Bodden at the Broward County Cystic Fibrosis Foundation weekdays during business hours at (954) 739-5006.
