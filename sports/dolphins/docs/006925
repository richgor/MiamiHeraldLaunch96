<m0> The talk that embattled Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin will or has asked for a trade to the Dolphins is merely gossip Miami-based agent Drew Rosenhaus has heard through the player grapevine, he said.<ep>
  ``All that I hear from a number of players is that Irvin wants to come here,'' said Rosenhaus, who reported on WFOR-TV that Irvin and the Dolphins may be talking about a trade (Rosenhaus works at the station as an NFL ``insider''). ``He's trying to call up the Dolphins to see if a trade can be worked out. The word is in the NFL that Michael Irvin wants to play for the Dolphins. He's tired of the situation in Dallas.<ep>
  ``I don't have anything concrete on this. . . . It wouldn't surprise me if the situation heated up.''<ep>
  Although an Irvin-Jimmy Johnson reunion from their days at the University of Miami would seem a perfect fit for an imperfect situation, that deal would seem unlikely.<ep>
  First, Irvin, a native of Fort Lauderdale, has been indicted on drug possession charges and could face jail time. He could also be suspended by the NFL.<ep>
  The Dolphins would probably have to give up one of their top receivers (--) Fred Barnett or O.J. McDuffie (--) and maybe one or more high draft picks, both of which Johnson holds dearly.<ep>
  Last year, Irvin signed a five-year contract worth roughly $17 million and his salary-cap figure makes him tough to trade. That and the fact that Dallas has no wideout threat besides Irvin other than Deion Sanders.<ep>
     Neither Johnson nor Irvin's agent, Steve Endicott, was available for comment.<ep>
   Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple said the team was not aware of any trade talk.<ep>
