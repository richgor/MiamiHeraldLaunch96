  Too bad cornerback Calvin Jackson had to leave practice 20 minutes early Wednesday after aggravating his sprained right ankle in coverage drills. Coach Jimmy Johnson was having a good time watching him in action.<P>

  Johnson was so impressed that he couldn't stop praising this kid from Fort Lauderdale. In fact, he said Jackson might well be Troy Vincent's replacement at left corner.<P>

  ``Right now, he's head and shoulders above any defensive back as far as depth and he could very well challenge for a starting position.'' Johnson said. ``Once we get him in the kind of condition we want him in, he's capable of being a starting corner in this league.<P>

  ``He has got as quick a [pair of] feet as any of the defensive backs that we've got. He has fit well into the new pass defense that we've installed and he's made as many plays as anybody in the secondary.''<P>

  The glowing review wasn't a concocted scheme to get penciled-in starter Terrell Buckley to work harder or to stir up the competition. Buckley has done everything asked of him and there are only a few people on this team who don't have to worry about being replaced.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  Jackson, who starred at Dillard High, has performed well in the Dolphins' six days of non-contact drills. If he shows the marked improvement he showed last year in his second season, he may have a lengthy career -- which would truly be a tale in overcoming the odds.<P>

  ``It hasn't been a clean-cut ride,'' Jackson said of his tenure with the Dolphins. ``It's had its bumps and bruises. I guess they had confidence in me that I'd pan out sooner or later -- hopefully sooner than later.''<P>

  If things had gone the traditional way, Jackson would be with the other Dolphins rookies, back on their college campuses or at home, telling their friends about mini-camp or what it's like dealing with Johnson.<P>

  But Jackson's post high-school career has not been normal.<P>

  After his freshman season at Auburn, Jackson played for two years then left after struggling academically. He could have stayed, got his grades together and rejoined the team. Instead, he applied for the supplemental draft.<P>

  There were no takers.<P>

  The Dolphins gave him a tryout and kept him on their practice squad in 1994, activating him for two games. He lived at home with his grandparents, who raised him, saving most of the $60,000 he earned that year.<P>

  ``I don't think I'd be as mature right now, as far as some of the skills I learned since I've been here,'' Jackson said. ``I think this was a pretty good move for me. It worked out well.''<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  But people shouldn't follow his lead, Jackson added.<P>

  ``Stay in school,'' he said. ``Not everybody can make it. It's real hard, some of the things you have to deal with and some of the things you don't know about being in this world. It's a job. Either you do it or you don't and when reality sets in, it really sets in.''<P>

  Jackson, who moved into an apartment with former Dolphins cornerback Frankie Smith, saw increased playing time last year on special teams and at nickel back. He had 15 tackles and intercepted Buffalo's Jim Kelly late in the season, gaining 23 yards on the return.<P>

  ``That showed me I can play in this league,'' Jackson said. ``Having the experience really helps a lot and I think I've carried that into this season.''<P>

  Another thing he's carried into this season is extra weight. He weighs 190 pounds -- five more than Johnson says is acceptable. With that, you can also tell how much Johnson has taken a liking to Jackson.<P>

  ``He said we can diet together,'' Jackson said.
