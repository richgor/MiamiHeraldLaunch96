<m0>  With Bryan Cox, the Dolphins' corps of linebackers was adequate but far from imposing. With Cox now playing for Chicago, the only people scared of what's left may be the Miami faithful.<ep>
   Fear not, says outside linebacker Chris Singleton. With Coach Jimmy Johnson's new, aggressive scheme, the leftover linebackers should be able to show their abilities that were lost in the more passive approach of the past.<ep>
   Not only that, with Cox gone, the emphasis on one man has been eliminated. This is a team effort and because of that, more players will be playmakers, Singleton added.<ep>
   ``We're going to come in and have an aggressive, tough, smart, team-oriented defense,'' said Singleton, who finished third on the team with 100 tackles last year. ``We don't want individuals. We don't need big-name guys or this guy over here and this guy over there. We want to all be on the same page. We want everybody making tackles.''<ep>
   Singleton, along with Dwight Hollier and Aubrey Beavers, are the likely starters and all will be playing new positions. Hollier replaces Cox in the middle, Singleton moves from the weakside to the strongside and Beavers may finally break in as a starter on the weakside.<ep>
   With that, nobody's job is a lock. Johnson said he plans to keep rookies Zach Thomas and LaCurtis Jones as backups. Second-year players Jeff Kopp and Antonio Armstrong also are in the mix. A trade for a linebacker shouldn't be ruled out, even though Johnson said he is pleased with what he has.<ep>
   ``Hollier and Singleton both are learning the new scheme and in today's practice, I saw Aubrey Beavers do some nice things from the weakside position,'' Johnson said Tuesday. ``We're going to have to wait until they get shoulder pads on and see how they fit and how good a players they're going to be.''<ep>
   None of the veterans are considered pass-rush specialists, an area where Miami is lacking. Singleton, playing for his sixth head coach in seven years, was the only one in this group to record a sack last season. He had one.<ep>
  Cox, who had a team-high 142 tackles, also led the team with 7.5 sacks. Even so, the Dolphins' new scheme, out of their old 4-3 alignment, is designed for linemen to occupy blockers so linebackers can blitz and roam.<ep>
   ``This allows us to run to the ball and get places instead of fighting off blocks and struggling to make a play,'' said Beavers, who made just 12 tackles last year and is <m1> <m0>recovering from a broken left hand. ``We still have a lot to prove, but this new defense at least gives us more of an opportunity to get things done.''<ep>
   Johnson believes good pass defense comes with a proficient rush and even though he doesn't have a Bruce Smith-type talent, the defensive line rotation system should provide a constant onslaught of fresh players. <m1><ep>
<m0>   In turn, linebackers should not be left mismatched against running backs and tight ends.<ep>
   So don't be surprised if the Dolphins' linebackers turn out to be better than what people project, Singleton said. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``Nobody ever took an opportunity to find out about us,'' Singleton said. ``It was always Bryan Cox, and there was nothing wrong with that because he was a great football player. But nobody took the time to find out what our role was on defense. They never wanted to find out about a Dwight Hollier or Chris Singleton or Aubrey Beavers.''<ql>

<m0>   Warning to all Dolphins prima donnas: You're going to be covering kickoffs, blocking for the punter and leaping to knock down extra points.<ep>
  ``Everybody plays on special teams except for quarterbacks,'' Coach <m0>Jimmy Johnson <m0>said Tuesday. ``It's a team thing. . . . That's how I did it in Dallas and that's one reason why we were as good as any team in the league.<ep>
  ``As far as activating players on Sunday, a lot of times I may activate a position player that's better on [special] teams than <m4>  <m2><ql>
<m0>somebody else at his position because of the performance on special teams. That will play a big part in my decision on making the roster and players being activated on Sundays.''<ep>
   (box) Veteran right tackle <m0>Ron Heller<m0> <m1> <m0>underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder to clean out loose particles Monday (--) his third operation since last season. Heller also had arthroscopic surgery on both knees.<ep>
   Even with injuries and age working against him, the Dolphins are reluctant to release or recommend Heller, 33, retire.<ep>
   ``I think the biggest thing Ron gives you is leadership and he gives you experience,'' Johnson said. ``There is no question he can add to our football team. The biggest thing there is will he be healthy and ready to go once training camp starts?''<ep>
   (box) Quarterback camp resumes at 10 a.m. today. Practice is open to the public.<ql>
