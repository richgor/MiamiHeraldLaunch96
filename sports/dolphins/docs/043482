After the Dolphins, next in value were the New York Yankees at $209 million, the New York Knicks at $205 million and the Baltimore Ravens at $201 million.<ep>
   The San Francisco 49ers were sixth at $196 million.<ep>
   The Florida Marlins were 75th at $98 million and the Miami Heat 77th at $97 million. The Florida Panthers were 108th of the 111 teams ranked, with a value of $45 million.<ql>
