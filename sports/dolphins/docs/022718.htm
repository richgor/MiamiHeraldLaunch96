  New Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson wants to run things his way. But when it comes to working his team, Johnson has to do some things the players' way.<BR>
<P>

  Several Dolphins called the National Football League Players' Association with concerns over some of the drills Johnson required during April mini- and quarterback camps, causing the players' union to send the Dolphins a letter warning them of potential violations.<BR>
<P>

   Linemen, defensive backs and receivers participated in daily one-on-one drills that are against the rules of the NFL's collective bargaining agreement, the letter said. Some players also expressed concern over what they felt was excessive contact in the seven days of drills, in which they wore just shorts, jerseys and helmets.<P>

   ``There were some things we did, which according to the CBA you can't do,'' said Dolphins defensive end Trace Armstrong, president of the NFLPA. ``You can't blame the coaches. It's been in the collective bargaining agreement, it just hasn't been enforced.<P>

   ``It was kind of a joke last year with Coach Shula. We'd all be standing around saying, `We're doing these illegal one-on-ones.' It just wasn't enforced. Now there has been greater emphasis on enforcing it.''<P>

   The NFLPA said roughly six teams it declined to name were warned of violations. Calls from players spurred the letters from the NFLPA, which were also sent to the NFL's management council.<P>

   ``If somebody's going over the edge, we generally get calls from players,'' said Doug Allen, assistant executive director of the NFLPA. ``Several players from Miami called us.''<P>

   An NFLPA employee Allen declined to name, who was in South Florida to meet with Dolphins players, attended one of the workouts and also reported the violations and the players' concerns to the union.<P>

   In his only comment, Johnson, through a team spokesman, said: ``We don't want to do any drills that will get players injured but this is a physical game even without pads.''<P>

   Two players sustained injuries but in neither's case was it related to excessive contact. Wide receiver Charles Jordan broke a small bone in his wrist after falling and linebacker Aubrey Beavers broke a bone in his hand batting down a pass.<P>

   No player publicly expressed problems with Johnson's workouts, other than about the amount of conditioning he put them through.<P>

   ``He's not out there trying to kill us,'' Armstrong said.<P>

   Because players reported Miami's coaching staff to the union, there is some concern of repercussions, Armstrong said. But, he added, Johnson has dealt with players' complaints professionally so far and doesn't seem the type get hung up in union and management politics.<P>

   Allen said the NFLPA considers the matter handled, and because it has not had problems with Johnson in the past, it doesn't expect the team to violate the guidelines now that they have been brought to Johnson's attention in writing.<P>

   ``This is a concern that we've addressed, the problem was resolved and everybody's moving forward,'' Allen said. ``We know players have to work hard in mini-camp. This isn't about providing a circumstance where players can loaf. We want to protect player safety. They're not in pads for a reason.''<P>

   The Dolphins have a non-contact mini-camp June 3-7. The players finally don full pads July 15 for the start of training camp.<P>

   Think Johnson has that date circled?
