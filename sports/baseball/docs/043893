<m0>  Henry Rodriguez's second homer of the game, a three-run shot in the eighth inning, sent the Montreal Expos to a 5-2 victory Friday night over the visiting Houston Astros.<ep>
   The game was delayed briefly following Rodriguez's homers for a new fan ritual. Spectators in the left-field bleachers have begun throwing Oh Henry candy bars onto the playing field after Rodriguez connects. Rodriguez has a career-high 15 homers this season. His previous best was eight.<ep>
   The Astros had beaten the Expos seven straight times at Olympic Stadium.<ql>

<m0>  (box) The Expos placed LHP Kirk Rueter on the 15-day disabled list with inflammation of the left knee and recalled RHP Alex Pacheco from Triple-A Ottawa.<ql>

<m0>  ST. LOUIS (--) Raul Mondesi scored from second base in the 12th inning when St. Louis first baseman Pat Borders, playing there for the first time in his career, mishandled a ground ball for an error.<ep>
   Cardinals reliever Dennis Eckersley (0-3) struck out the first two hitters in the 12th, before Mondesi doubled down the left-field line. After an intentional walk, Borders, who has played more than 700 games in his major league career at catcher, wasn't able to field Eric Karros' hard hit grounder.<ql>

<m0>  NEW YORK (--) Bobby Jones (3-1) allowed four hits in eight innings and rookie Butch Huskey hit his second homer of the season as the Mets snapped a four-game losing streak.<ep>
   The Cubs' best threat came in the seventh inning. Mark Grace led off with a single, and went to third when second baseman Jose Vizcaino misplayed a grounder by Luis Gonzalez. Scott Servais then lined out to left fielder Bernard Gilkey, who easily threw out Grace at the plate.<ql>

<m0>  PITTSBURGH (--) Glenallen Hill doubled in the winning run in the 10th inning and homered as the Giants withstood Mark Johnson's four RBI.<ep>
   Barry Bonds hit his major-leading 16th homer as the Giants lost a 4-1 lead on Johnson's three-run homer in the sixth before rallying against Francisco Cordova (0-2).<ep>
   Bonds, only a .255 hitter against Pittsburgh since leaving the Pirates following the 1992 season, made it 2-0 with his homer in the first. Bonds' drive was his 10th homer in his past 13 games and his third in 22 career at-bats against Denny Neagle, who was 4-0 with a 1.96 ERA in his previous five starts.<ep>
   The Giants have an NL-leading 53 homers in 34 games, while the Pirates' staff has surrendered a league-high 48 in 35 games.<ql>

   The Braves tagged Phillies starter Terry Mulholland (3-3) for eight runs and nine hits in only three-plus innings.<ep>
   Javy Lopez had a career-high four hits and drove in two runs for Atlanta, which matched a season-high with 18 hits. The Braves also had 18 hits in an 11-9 victory against the Phillies on May 5, Smoltz's last start.<ep>
