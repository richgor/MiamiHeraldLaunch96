   Phillies opening-day starter Sid Fernandez will be forced to miss his start Thursday because of a sore right knee that will require surgery to clean out after the season, if it holds up that long. Fernandez recently admitted that team trainer Jeff Cooper advised him to have the surgery last winter, but he declined since he would have been unable to play golf for two months.<BR>
Tinsley to DL<P>

   The Phillies placed outfielder Lee Tinsley on the 15-day disabled list Monday because of a strained right rib cage. Tinsley was injured while taking batting practice in Atlanta on Sunday.<P>

   As a replacement, the Phillies signed free-agent outfielder Ruben Amaro Jr., who began the season with Syracuse of the International League but was released Sunday.<P>

   Amaro played with Philadelphia during parts of the 1992-93 season. His father, Ruben Amaro Sr., played shortstop with the Phillies from 1960 to 1965.<P>

   To make room on the 40-man roster, Philadelphia transferred pitcher Bobby Mu&ntilde;oz from the 15-day to the 60-day disabled list.<BR>
 <BR>
Miceli to Double A<P>

   The Pirates moved to solve their increasingly worrisome pitching problems Monday, recalling left-hander Darrell May from Triple A Calgary and demoting closer Dan Miceli to Double A Carolina.<BR>
<P>

   With Zane Smith on the disabled list with a pulled hamstring, the Pirates need a fifth starter for at least two weeks, so May will start Tuesday against San Diego.<P>

   The demotion of Miceli to Double-A Carolina is a setback not only for the hardest thrower on the staff but for the Pirates, who envisioned him as a power pitcher capable of saving 30 games. He had 21 saves as a rookie last season.<P>

   Miceli (0-1, 7.84) never has found a rhythm, although he converted his only save opportunity. His inability to throw strikes forced Manager Jim Leyland into shifting him out of the closer's role only two weeks into the season.
