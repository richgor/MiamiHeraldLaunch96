   Amid the mediocrity and failure of the 1996 Boston Red Sox, Roger Clemens is reclaiming his career.<P>

   Clemens' revival is no longer an early-season aberration. Clemens, 33, is pitching as well as ever at a time when he has never been needed more.<P>

   In a 4-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers before 7,039 at County Stadium Tuesday, Clemens struck out 10 and allowed four hits and two runs in seven-plus innings.<P>

   The victory was Boston's fifth in six games, and it followed a loss. Clemens is 109-43 after a loss in his career.<P>

   In his past three starts, Clemens is 2-1 with a 1.90 ERA. He has struck out 34 and walked five in 23 innings. He has struck out 10 or more in three consecutive starts for the first time since Sept. 25, 30, and Oct. 4, 1987.<P>

   ``No reason behind it,'' Clemens said. ``I feel the same as I always have.''<P>

   He may feel the same, but the results are considerably different. Clemens was 30-26 the past three seasons and started this season 0-4. It was the first time in his career that he was four games under .500.<P>

   Clemens (2-4, 3.38) pitched better than his record, but was not pitching like a stopper. In his past three starts, he has stepped back in time.<P>

   ``He just lifts up the whole team,'' Manager Kevin Kennedy said. ``He's the go-to guy, the ace. You feed off guys like that. Everybody looks to him.''<BR>
Late Tuesday<P>

 <LI> Rangers 5, Blue Jays 1: Damon Buford drove in the tying run with a sixth-inning single and Will Clark hit a three-run homer in the seventh, but Texas got a scare when Juan Gonzalez had to leave the game with a left leg injury.<P>

   Gonzalez pulled up lame while running out a ground ball in the second inning. He was diagnosed with a strained left quadriceps and is listed as day-to-day.<P>

  <LI> Yankees 12, Tigers 5: Ruben Sierra drove in three runs in an eight-run sixth inning that carried New York to its eighth win in nine games.<P>

  <LI> White Sox 3, Orioles 2: Alex Fernandez and Roberto Hernandez combined on a five-hitter and Danny Tartabull hit a two-run homer.<P>

   Fernandez (5-2) gave up five hits and walked three in eight innings to become the American League's third five-game winner, joining Cleveland's Dennis Martinez and New York's Andy Pettitte. He struck out seven, including AL home run leader Brady Anderson three times.<P>

    <LI> Royals 5, Angels 3: Joe Vitiello's two-run homer in the eighth inning kept Jim Abbott winless in nine home starts since rejoining the Angels last season.<P>

    <LI> Twins 2, Mariners 0: Jose Parra pitched six shutout innings and Dennis Hocking and Jeff Reboulet knocked in the only runs of the game with sacrifice flies.<P>

      The Twins broke a four-game losing streak with their first shutout of the season, while the Mariners suffered their second shutout loss in three games. The Kingdome crowd of 15,626 was the Mariners' smallest home turnout of the season.
