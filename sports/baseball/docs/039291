<m0>  Former Boston Red Sox Manager <m0>Butch Hobson<m0> was bewildered when he received a packet of cocaine in an express delivery package, his <m1> <m0>attorneys said Tuesday.<ep>
   ``He was surprised to receive it. He was upset to receive it. And he wasn't sure what he was going to do with it,'' said Hobson's attorney, <m0>Stephen Famiglietti<m0>. ``. . . It did not occur to him to take it to police.''<ep>
   Hobson received the package, and 10 to 15 minutes later police knocked on his door. Hobson, 44, was arrested Saturday in a Pawtucket hotel on a charge of cocaine possession.<ep>
   Police were led to Hobson when they intercepted an overnight letter mailed from the Birmingham, Ala., area to the hotel where Hobson was staying with the Philadelphia Phillies' Triple A team he now manages, the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre Red Barons.<ep>
   Hobson has taken a leave of absence from the team and returned to his home in Fairhope, Ala.<ep>
   Arriving on a flight to Mobile, Ala., Hobson told reporters, to ``hang in there with me'' before going home with his family.<ql>
<m0>Langston may need surgery<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  An MRI exam on pitcher <m0>Mark Langston's<m0> right knee Monday showed a slight cartilage tear, but doctors have not determined whether the left-hander will need arthroscopic surgery. Surgery would probably result in at least a three-week stint on the disabled list.<ql>
<m0>Setback for Harvey<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Angels reliever <m0>Bryan Harvey's<m0> simulated game Monday was a simulation of his last major-league appearance with the <m1> <m0>Marlins on April 28, 1995 (--) it ended quickly because of pain in his right arm.<ep>
   Harvey, trying to recover from reconstructive elbow surgery last May, left the mound after four pitches Monday, and his rehabilitation assignment, which he hoped would begin at Single A Lake Elsinore on Saturday, will probably be pushed back.<ep>
   ``I think it was some scar tissue pulling (--) I don't think it's that serious.'' Harvey said.<ql>
