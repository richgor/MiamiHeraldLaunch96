<styl>crline <m0>From Herald Wire Services<ep>
   Phillies opening-day starter <m0>Sid Fernandez <m0>will be forced to miss his start Thursday because of a sore right knee that will require surgery to clean out after the season, if it holds up that long. Fernandez recently admitted that team trainer <m0>Jeff Cooper <m0>advised him to have the surgery last winter, but he declined since he would have been unable to play golf for two months.<ql>

<m0>Tinsley to DL<ep>
<m0>   The Phillies placed outfielder <m0>Lee Tinsley <m0>on the 15-day disabled list Monday because of a strained right rib cage. Tinsley was injured while taking batting practice in Atlanta on Sunday.<ep>
   As a replacement, the Phillies signed free-agent outfielder <m0>Ruben Amaro Jr., <m0>who began the season with Syracuse of the International League but was released Sunday.<ep>
   Amaro played with Philadelphia during parts of the 1992-93 season. His father, <m0>Ruben Amaro <m0>Sr., played shortstop with the Phillies from 1960 to 1965.<ep>
   To make room on the 40-man roster, Philadelphia transferred pitcher <m0>Bobby Mun~oz <m0>from the 15-day to the 60-day disabled list.<ql>

<m0>Miceli to Double A<ep>
<m0>   The Pirates moved to solve their increasingly worrisome pitching problems Monday, recalling left-hander <m0>Darrell May <m0>from Triple A Calgary and demoting closer <m0>Dan Miceli <m0>to Double A Carolina.<ql>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   With <m0>Zane Smith <m0>on the disabled list with a pulled hamstring, the Pirates need a fifth starter for at least two weeks, so May will start Tuesday against San Diego.<ep>
   The demotion of Miceli to Double-A Carolina is a setback not only for the hardest thrower on the staff but for the Pirates, who envisioned him as a power pitcher capable of saving 30 games. He had 21 saves as a rookie last season.<ep>
   Miceli (0-1, 7.84) never has found a rhythm, although he converted his only save opportunity. His inability to throw strikes forced Manager <m0>Jim Leyland <m0>into shifting him out of the closer's role only two weeks into the season.<ql>
