     David Cone, sidelined by numbness in his fingers, has a ``slight aneurysm'' in his right arm and will undergo surgery today.<P>

    The Yankees said Cone's aneurysm -- a swelling of an artery because of a weakness in its wall -- is ``correctable.'' A person with knowledge of Cone's condition said the aneurysm is in ``a good spot'' for surgery.<P>

   Even though the Yankees did not discuss specific plans for Cone, they hope he will be able to throw in about a month and then possibly return to the rotation by August, The New York Times reported in today's editions.<P>

   Cone, 4-1 with an AL-leading 2.03 ERA, had been scheduled to pitch Tuesday night. But the 33-year-old right-hander missed a start for just the second time in his career after tests revealed the aneurysm.<P>

    ``It's an anxious time,'' Manager Joe Torre said before the Yankees divulged Cone's aneurysm. ``We're more anxious for him then in how it affects the team. If it's not getting better, we have to find out what it is.''<BR>
<LI> Yankees 12, Tigers 5<BR>
SIERRA DRIVES IN 3<BR>
<P>

   NEW YORK -- Ruben Sierra drove in three runs in an eight-run sixth inning that carried New York to its eighth win in nine games.<BR>
<LI> Red Sox 4, Brewers 2<BR>
CLEMENS K'S 10<BR>
<P>

   MILWAUKEE -- Roger Clemens struck out 10 -- making it three straight starts he's struck out at least that many -- to win his second straight start. Clemens (2-4) gave up four hits and walked three in 7 2/3 innings.<BR>
<LI> A's 8, Indians 4<BR>
McGWIRE HITS HR<BR>
<P>

 Mark McGwire hit a three-run homer and Jason Giambi had four singles as the Oakland Athletics won their second straight against Cleveland.<BR>
McGwire hit his fourth homer of the season in the third inning, a 428-foot blast to center field.<BR>
<LI> Rangers 5, Blue Jays 1<BR>
CLARK HITS 3-RUN SHOT<BR>
<P>

   ARLINGTON, Texas -- Damon Buford drove in the tying run with a sixth-inning single and Will Clark hit a three-run homer in the seventh, but Texas got a scare when Juan Gonzalez had to leave the game with a left leg injury.<P>

   Gonzalez pulled up lame while running out a ground ball in the second inning. He was diagnosed with a strained left quadriceps and is listed as day-to-day.<BR>
<LI> White Sox 3, Orioles 2<BR>
TARTABULL HITS HR<BR>
<P>

   CHICAGO -- Alex Fernandez and Roberto Hernandez combined on a five-hitter and Danny Tartabull hit a two-run homer.<BR>
Attorney says Hobson innocent<BR>
<P>

  Former Boston Red Sox Manager Butch Hobson was bewildered when he received a packet of cocaine in an express delivery package, his attorneys said Tuesday.<P>

   ``He was surprised to receive it. He was upset to receive it. And he wasn't sure what he was going to do with it,'' said Hobson's attorney, Stephen Famiglietti. ``. . . It did not occur to him to take it to police.''<BR>
Langston on DL<P>

    One day after an MRI revealed a slight tear of cartilage in his right knee, California LHP Mark Langston was placed on the disabled list. He will undergo arthroscopic surgery today, and he's expected to be out from six to eight weeks.<P>

   The Angels recalled left-handed reliever Ben VanRyn and righty Todd Frohwirth from Triple-A Vancouver.
