     David Cone had surgery Friday to repair an aneurysm in his right shoulder, but the New York Yankees wouldn't predict whether their ace will be able to pitch again this season.<P>

   But before the Yankees' game against the White Sox Friday night, Manager Joe Torre told his players that Cone might not be back until next year.<P>

   Doctors took a one-inch vein from Cone's upper left thigh and used it to repair two arteries in his right shoulder during the three-hour operation at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, about three miles from Yankee Stadium.<P>

   Both doctors involved in the operation said Cone should be able to pitch again, but that they couldn't be more specific.<P>

   ``We are optimistic, and knowing David, his return will probably be sooner rather than later,'' said Dr. Stuart Hershon, the Yankees team physician.<P>

   Doctors not involved have said that based on the recovery time of other pitchers who have had this type of surgery, it is unlikely that Cone would be able to pitch before late this season at the earliest.<P>

   Steve Soderstrom, currently pitching for Triple-A Phoenix, and Kevin Rogers, pitching in Pittsburgh's extended spring training, had similar operations in 1994 that ended their seasons.<P>

   Cone is expected to be hospitalized until the middle of next week.<BR>
Around the league<P>

   <LI> RANGERS: Kevin Elster will remain the starting shortstop, even after ``shortstop of the future'' Benji Gil recovers from back surgery, M Johnny Oates said.<P>

   <LI> TWINS: There's been little change in the condition of OF Kirby Puckett, who has been out all season because of blurred vision in his right eye caused by glaucoma, GM Terry Ryan said. Puckett rejoined the team Friday for the start of its series in Oakland, but will remain benched until his vision improves.<P>

  <LI> YANKEES: Charges of marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia against OF Dion James were reduced to a disorderly conduct offense in a plea bargain, officials said.
