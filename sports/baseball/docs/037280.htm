   Atlanta rallied for three runs in the ninth and Javy Lopez doubled in the winning run in the 10th Tuesday night to give the Braves their fourth straight victory, 6-5 over the Colorado Rockies.<P>

   Curtis Leskanic (2-1) retired the first two batters in the 10th before David Justice walked and Lopez hit a 3-2 pitch to deep center. Larry Walker leaped against the wall but missed the ball by inches, allowing Justice to come all the around to score.<P>

   Brad Clontz (1-2) pitched a scoreless 10th.<P>

   Atlanta's ninth-inning rally prevented Greg Maddux from losing consecutive starts for the first time in nearly two years and cost Rockies starter Mike Farmer his first major-league win.<P>

   Farmer, called up from the minors April 29, allowed only two hits in seven innings but Colorado's bullpen denied him the win in his first major-league start.<P>

   The Braves rallied for three runs in the ninth on two-out, run-scoring singles by Ryan Klesko, Dwight Smith and Marquis Grissom. Leskanic went to two strikes on three straight hitters, but Jeff Blauser walked, Smith dumped an 0-2 pitch to left for a single and Grissom dropped a hit in left-center to score Blauser with the tying run.<BR>
<LI> Expos 8, Cubs 3<BR>
ALOU SPARKS MONTREAL<BR>
<P>

   MONTREAL -- Moises Alou and former Miami Hurricane F.P. Santangelo hit two-run doubles in a five-run seventh inning to lift Montreal over Chicago Cubs and to its ninth straight home win.<P>

   With Montreal trailing 3-2, Terry Adams (1-1) walked Andy Stankiewicz and Mark Grudzielanek. Mike Lansing sacrificed against Doug Jones, Henry Rodriguez was walked intentionally and Alou doubled for a 4-3 lead.<P>

   David Segui walked and, one out later, Santangelo doubled it make it 6-3. Dave Silvestri followed with an RBI single. Rodriguez singled home a run in the eighth.<P>

   Dave Veres (4-0) allowed two runs and three hits in two innings as Montreal won its fourth straight overall. The Expos haven't lost at home since April 18, a 9-8 defeat against Philadelphia.<P>

   Adams was charged with two runs and did not retire a batter.<P>

   Segui homered in the second off Steve Trachsel, but Tavo Alvarez walked Mark Grace with the bases loaded in the fifth.<P>

   Santangelo hit a leadoff triple in the home fifth off Steve Trachsel, then hustled home with Montreal's second run on Cliff Floyd's groundout. Santangelo, filling in for injured Rondell White, scored when Floyd hit a chopper to Grace at third. Grace threw home, but Santangelo slid around catcher Brian Dorsett's tag for a 2-1 lead.<BR>
Perez out 4 months<BR>
<P>

  Montreal starter Carlos Perez underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder Tuesday and will be sidelined for about four months.<P>

   Perez, 24, has not pitched this season. Doctors repaired a torn labrum tendon and an incomplete tear rotator cuff tear.<BR>
Around the league<P>

 <LI> REDS: Reggie Sanders has been cleared to swing a bat again, an indication he could be back before the end of the month. The right fielder, who suffered a tear around a disk in his lower back while trying to make a diving catch April 12, will hit off a batting tee today and take ground balls.
