       The strain of juggling closers Troy Percival and Lee Smith finally got to Angels Manager Marcel Lachemann after he used Percival as a set-up man Wednesday night against Kansas City, only to see Smith blow a save chance.<P>

   Smith (0-for-2 in save chances, 3.00 ERA) allowed an unearned run in the ninth inning of a game California eventually lost, 3-1, in 14 innings. The crowd of 16,210 -- aware Percival is 11-for-11 in save chances, has not allowed a run in 13 2/3 innings this season and had retired his last 21 batters in a row -- booed Smith and the manager.<P>

   ``Lee is going to be picked on and I'm going to get crucified,'' Lachemann barked at reporters. ``Jump on the wagon. Say what you want. You want to bad-mouth me, fine. You want to come after me, come. It was a decision I made a long time ago, one a lot of people don't like who aren't held accountable for what they say or write. I made a statement I'm held accountable for.''<P>

   Smith, whom Lachemann promised would regain his closer's job when his strained right knee healed, said, ``I don't like the situation I'm in. Lach feels it's a better team if I'm part of it, but I don't like to feel like I'm in the way. What's bothering me is for him to think he has an obligation to me. His obligation is to the club.''<P>

   Lachemann wasn't helped when General Manager Bill Bavasi said last Sunday that Percival was definitely the team's closer. Bavasi later retracted his statement and said the decision was Lachemann's.<BR>
Around the league<P>

 <LI> TIGERS: Despite having a rotation that entered the weekend with a 6-17 record and 7.12 ERA, M Buddy Bell and GM Randy Smith are resisting the urge to promote Justin Thompson, the team's top draft choice from 1991 who is 3-2 with a 2.51 ERA after seven starts at Class AAA Toledo. Thompson, a left-hander pitching above Class AA for the first time after missing the 1994 season with elbow problems, has walked 14 and struck out 37 in 46 2/3 innings.<P>

   ``He's been so dominant,'' Bell conceded. ``He's going to be a good pitcher. But we're talking about a 22-year-old kid everybody is waiting to see. It's like he almost can't be good enough, so we're better off giving him the time he needs to develop right.''<P>

   <LI> MARINERS: Since being recalled from Tacoma, OF Darren Bragg was 8-for-18 (.444) and had two first-inning leadoff homers in his first four games. ``Maybe he thinks he's Brady Anderson,'' M Lou Piniella said.<P>

   <LI> ANGELS: The loss of P Mark Langston for 6-8 weeks after knee surgery has the Angels adding knuckleballer Dennis Springer to their rotation but looking harder at trade possibilities with the Astros (Greg Swindell or Doug Brocail) and Padres (Tim Worrell or Scott Sanders).<P>

   <LI> WHITE SOX: Spinal surgery has probably ended the comeback attempt of reliever Bobby Thigpen, who had a 7.11 ERA in four appearances for Class AAA Nashville. ``It's too bad,'' Chicago GM Ron Schueler said. ``His velocity was just starting to come back.'' . . . P Jason Bere and INF Norberto Martin will begin their rehabilitation assignments at Nashville next week.<P>

  <LI> ORIOLES: Baltimore is looking at San Diego's Tim Worrell, Scott Sanders and Willie Blair as possible arms to bolster their rotation, and shortstop Manny Alexander has the Padres' interest.
