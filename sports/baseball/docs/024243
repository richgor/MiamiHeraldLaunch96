<m0>  New York Yankees right-hander <m0>David Cone,<m0> hospitalized with an aneurysm in his right shoulder, is likely to be sidelined at least a month, and possibly the season.<ep>
   Cone remained in Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York on Wednesday for more tests on the small <m4>Cone  <m2><ql>
<m0>aneurysm found a day earlier.<ep>
   The Yankees have not confirmed if Cone, 33, will undergo surgery despite reports saying he will be operated on immediately. The club said it must first know the test results before saying if Cone will pitch again this year.<ep>
   ``I don't think they're expecting him to be back in the next month or so,'' Manager <m0>Joe Torre<m0> said before Wednesday night's game against Detroit. ``I think that's safe to say.<ep>
   ``As far as him pitching again [this year], I know they haven't made any promises as to when to look for him. To me, that's the last of our concerns.''<ep>
   The aneurysm, located in the front of the right shoulder and described as ``correctable'' by the Yankees, is believed to have caused numbness in the middle three fingers of Cone's pitching hand most of the season.<ep>
   An aneurysm, a dilation of a blood vessel, is most often found in the heart and brain, where it poses the greatest danger.<ep>
   Cone is 4-1 with an AL-leading 2.03 ERA. The Yankees placed him on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to last Friday, and brought up pitcher <m0>Paul Gibson<m0> from Triple A Columbus.<ep>
   (box) The Yankees signed SS <m0>Felix Fermin,<m0> released by Seattle last month, to a minor-league contract. Fermin, 32, batted .195 in 73 games last season with the Mariners.<ql>
<m0>Hobson maintains innocence<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Former Boston Red Sox Manager <m0>Butch Hobson<m0> maintained his innocence on drug charges, saying from his Alabama home that he wants his reputation restored.<ep>
   Hobson, 44, was arrested in Pawtucket, R.I., Saturday after police found two grams of cocaine in his hotel room. ``I just want this dealt with as quickly as possible,'' Hobson told The Boston Globe.<ql>
