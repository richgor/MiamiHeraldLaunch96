     David Cone, sidelined by numbness in his fingers, has a ``slight aneurysm'' in his right arm and will undergo surgery today.<ep>
    The Yankees said Cone's aneurysm (--) a swelling of an artery because of a weakness in its wall (--) is ``correctable.'' A person with knowledge of Cone's condition said the aneurysm is in ``a good spot'' for surgery.<ep>
   Even though the Yankees did not discuss specific plans for Cone, they hope he will be able to throw in about a month and then possibly return to the rotation by August, The New York Times reported in today's editions.<ep>
   Cone, 4-1 with an AL-leading 2.03 ERA, had been scheduled to pitch Tuesday night. But the 33-year-old right-hander missed a start for just the second time in his career after tests revealed the aneurysm.<ep>
    ``It's an anxious time,'' Manager Joe Torre said before the Yankees divulged Cone's aneurysm. ``We're more anxious for him then in how it affects the team. If it's not getting better, we have to find out what it is.''<ql>
