   Steve Avery continued his strong pitching with a six-hitter and Chipper Jones hit a two-run homer Monday night to give the Atlanta Braves a 4-1 victory over the visiting Colorado Rockies.<ep>
   Avery (3-2) has allowed more than two runs in only one of his seven starts, showing he has returned to the form that led to 18-win seasons in 1991 and '93. He was 7-13 with a 4.67 ERA last season.<ep>
   Avery's only slipup came in the sixth inning after he retired the first two batters. Dante Bichette doubled down the left-field line and Larry Walker brought him home with a single to center.<ep>
   Other than that, Avery was masterful. He had a season-high nine strikeouts, walked no one, and other than the sixth, never gave up more than one hit in an inning. Plus, Bichette's double was the only extra-base hit by the power-hitting Rockies. Avery threw 101 pitches in his first complete game of the season.<ql>

<m0>   PITTSBURGH (--) Hideo Nomo won for the first time in three road starts this season and Raul Mondesi hit one of three Los Angeles homers as the Dodgers defeated Pittsburgh.<ep>
   Mike Piazza, hitless in two games since ending a 16-game hitting streak, added a two-run homer off John Hope (1-2). Greg Gagne added a three-run shot in the ninth off Joe Boever as homers accounted for all eight Dodgers' runs.<ep>
   The homers awakened a Dodgers' offense whose 121 runs scored before Monday were the second-fewest in the majors ahead of Florida.<ep>
   Nomo (5-2) wasn't nearly as dominating as he was in striking out 30 Pirates in two starts last season. He allowed four runs and eight hits in seven-plus innings, striking out five. He left after Mark Johnson's two-run homer in the eighth made it 5-4.<ql>

<m0>   PHILADELPHIA (--) James Mouton had a two-run homer and a two-run double and Doug Drabek allowed three hits over seven innings as Houston beat Philadelphia.<ep>
   Drabek (1-2) struck out nine and walked four. He allowed one earned run, Todd Zeile's fourth homer of the season in the fourth inning. The Phillies' other run against him came in the seventh on an error by first baseman Jeff Bagwell.<ql>

<m0>   MONTREAL (--) Pedro Martinez matched his career-high with 10 strikeouts and won his fourth straight start as Montreal beat Chicago.<ep>
   Martinez (4-1) allowed two runs on six hits and walked one before tiring in the eighth.<ep>
   Martinez, who threw a two-hitter to beat New York, 2-0, in his previous start, has allowed just five runs in 32 innings over his last four starts.<ep>
   The Expos scored four runs in the first inning off Jim Bullinger (1-3) en route to their eighth straight victory at Olympic Stadium.<ep>
   Moises Alou and F.P. Santangelo each drove in two runs in the inning. It marked the second straight start Bullinger has given up four runs in the first inning.<ql>
