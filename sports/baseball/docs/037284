<m0>  Baseball declined to discipline <m0>Marge Schott<m0> for her latest remarks about <m0>Adolf Hitler<m0> (--) remarks for which she apologized Tuesday because they ``offended many people.''<ep>
 However, Acting Commissioner <m0>Bud Selig <m0>left open the possibility he would take action against the Cincinnati Reds owner at a later date, said a top baseball official, speaking on the condition he not be identified.<ep>
   Selig issued a statement saying he was ``saddened and disappointed'' by Schott's initial comments but ``gratified'' by her apology.<ep>
   During an interview broadcast Sunday, Schott repeated previous assertions that Hitler was ``good at the beginning'' but then ``went too far.''<ep>
   After hours of consultations with baseball officials, Schott released a statement through her team that said, in part:<ep>
   ``I am very sorry that my remarks on ESPN last Sunday offended many people. This was not my intent at all. Sometimes I do not always express myself well, as in this instance.<ep>
   ``Let me take this opportunity to set the record straight. I do not and have never condoned Adolf Hitler's policies of hatred, militarism and genocide. Hitler was unquestionably one of history's most despicable tyrants.<ep>
   `` . . . I will continue to try to be more sensitive to all people, and in the future will be more careful of what I say and to whom.''<ep>
   Selig said there would be no punishment, but that he would continue to ``monitor the situation.''<ep>
   At least one man was not satisfied with that. Rabbi <m0>Marvin Hier, <m0>founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, sent letters to all major-league owners calling for them to oust Schott as the Reds' owner.<ep>
   ``I think they've been monitoring the situation for a year in her case. I wish we'd have an umpire who'd have the guts to say, `You're out.' ''<ql>
