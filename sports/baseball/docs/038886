<m0>   Ken Caminiti hit two-run homers in his first two at-bats and the San Diego Padres held on to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-4, Wednesday in the first game of a double-header in Pittsburgh.<ep>
   The Padres, whose four-game lead in the NL West entering the day's games was the largest in any division, are 10-4 on the road. They started 4-9 away from home last season.<ep>
   Caminiti's two-homer game was the seventh of his career and his first since Sept. 19. He followed Marc Newfield's two-out walk with a shot over the left-field wall in the first. Caminiti then added an even longer drive in the third with Steve Finley on third. Caminiti now has five homers.<ep>
   Pittsburgh rookie Darrell May (0-1) got into trouble in the three-run third by walking Rickey Henderson with one out. Finley singled before both runners advanced on stolen bases a pitch apart, and Henderson scored as catcher Jason Kendall threw wildly on Finley's steal.<ep>
   But Kendall got the Pirates back into the game with his first career homer, a two-run drive that chased Padres starter Bob Tewksbury (4-1) and made it 5-4 in the seventh.<ep>
   Tewksbury, making his first start against Pittsburgh since June 17, 1994, also permitted Charlie Hayes' RBI double in the second and Al Martin's sacrifice fly in the sixth.<ep>
   Bryce Florie pitched out of a two-on, two-out jam in the eighth, and Trevor Hoffman worked the ninth for his sixth save. The Padres are 6-1 in Pittsburgh over the last two seasons.<ql>

<m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>(box) Reds 3, Dodgers 2: <m0>In Cincinnati, Eric Anthony and Eric Davis hit consecutive homers in the 12th inning, giving Cincinnati the victory.<ep>
   Raul Mondesi's sacrifice fly off Marcus Moore (3-2) had put the Dodgers ahead in the top of the 12th, but Todd Worrell (0-1) had his first major failure.<ep>
   Anthony hit a 3-1 pitch into the upper deck in right field to tie it, the first homer and only the second run this season off Worrell. Davis, who hit grand slams in each of his last two games, followed with a homer to right-center on a 2-1 pitch.<ep>
<m0>   (box) Astros 7, Phillies 5: <m0>In Philadelphia, Jeff Bagwell went four-for-four and homered twice, and Orlando Miller broke an eighth-inning tie with a two-out single, leading Houston over Philadelphia.<ep>
   Bagwell hit an RBI single in the third, tied the score 5-5 with a two-run homer in the seventh off Russ Springer (2-2) and added a solo shot in the ninth off Ken Ryan. He has 12 homers this season, including three in the last two games.<ep>
   Anthony Young (1-1) pitched a scoreless seventh and Todd Jones, Houston's fourth reliever, pitched 1 1/3 hitless innings for his sixth save.<ep>
<m0>   (box) Giants 4, Cardinals 2: <m0>In St. Louis, Matt Williams and Barry Bonds homered as San Francisco stopped a four-game losing streak.<ep>
   With the score 2-2 in the seventh, Stan Javier singled off Tony Fossas (0-3) with one out and Bonds followed with his league-leading 14th homer.<ep>
   Allen Watson, (3-3) making his first start against the Cardinals since being traded for Royce Clayton, allowed two runs and seven hits in six innings.<ep>
   Rod Beck pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings for his sixth save, sending St. Louis to its 11th loss in 14 games.<ep>
<m0>   (box) Braves 6, Rockies 5: <m0>In Atlanta, Atlanta rallied for three runs in the ninth and Javy Lopez doubled in the winning run in the 10th to give the Braves their fourth straight victory.<ep>
   Curtis Leskanic (2-1) retired the first two batters in the 10th before David Justice walked and Lopez hit a 3-2 pitch to deep center. Larry Walker leaped against the wall but missed the ball by inches, allowing Justice to come all the around to score. Brad Clontz (1-2) pitched a scoreless 10th.<ep>
   Atlanta's ninth-inning rally prevented Greg Maddux from losing consecutive starts for the first time in nearly two years.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Expos 8, Cubs 3: <m0>In Montreal, Moises Alou and former Miami Hurricane F.P. Santangelo hit two-run doubles in a five-run seventh inning to lift Montreal to its ninth straight home victory.<ep>
   Dave Veres (4-0) allowed two runs and three hits in two innings as Montreal won its fourth straight overall. The Expos haven't lost at home since April 18, a 9-8 defeat against Philadelphia.<ql>
