  The tumor that has sidelined Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Brett Butler may have been caused by second-hand exposure to cigarette smoke, the surgeon who removed a cancerous tonsil from Butler's throat said Wednesday.<P>

   ``The biggest risk [for this type of cancer] is some exposure to nicotine products,'' said Dr. Robert Gadlage, an ear, nose and throat specialist in Duluth, Ga.<P>

   Gadlage downplayed the significance of Butler's use of chewing tobacco in his early days as a player. He said both of Butler's parents smoked, so Butler was exposed to second-hand smoke consistently as a child.<P>

   ``We can see someone who smokes two packs a day, three packs a day for 50 years who never gets this. Then there's somebody with minimal exposure like Brett,'' Gadlage told a news conference.<P>

   Butler, 38, was placed on the disabled list May 2 to have a tonsillectomy at Eastside Medical Center in Snellville, near his home in Duluth. His tonsils were removed Friday, and lab tests Tuesday confirmed cancer in the right tonsil.<P>

   Gadlage said Dr. William Grist, director of the Head and Neck Cancer Surgery Department at Emory University in Atlanta, believes there still is some cancer in Butler's neck. An abnormal lymph node will be removed May 21 and two weeks later, Butler will start six weeks of radiation treatments.<P>

   Gadlage said Grist ``didn't say anything about [Butler's] career being over. He did say it wouldn't be wise for him to try to go back this year.''<P>

   Lowery Robinson, a close friend of Butler, said the center fielder is in severe pain but ready to fight.<P>

   ``He's handling it pretty good,'' Robinson said. ``Brett has the makeup to beat it. . . . His faith will see him through.''<BR>
Columnists rip Schott<BR>
<P>

  Newspapers in Marge Schott's home town chastised the Cincinnati Reds owner Wednesday for her remarks about Adolf Hitler and urged her to sell or give up control of the team.<P>

   ``If Schott will not step aside willingly, it is time she was shoved,'' columnist Tim Sullivan wrote in The Cincinnati Enquirer.<P>

   Added columnist Joe Posnanski in The Cincinnati Post: ``She speaks mindlessly, without concern, without consideration.''<P>

   Schott apologized Tuesday, two days after ESPN broadcast an interview in which she said Hitler ``was good at the beginning, but he just went too far.''<P>

   In his column, Sullivan urged acting commissioner Bud Selig to use the best-interests-of-baseball power to compel Schott to sell her controlling interest in the Reds.
