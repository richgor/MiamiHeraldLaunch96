   When the Rangers put back-to-back complete games -- one-hitters, in fact -- together during the weekend in Detroit, it was cause for at least minor celebration. No one's arm, at last report, fell off. Mother Nature didn't rebel with earthquake and famine. Venerable Tiger Stadium, which has seen a few gems in its time, didn't collapse on the spot.<P>

   Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, such developments -- two pitchers on successive days actually finishing what they started -- were almost commonplace. These occurrences didn't send club officials scurrying for the record books. The Hall of Fame didn't demand souvenirs, like balls, caps and signed affidavits.<P>

   ``The way I looked at it,'' Nolan Ryan said, ``when I got to the mound, I didn't expect to leave until the game was over. Finishing the game was part of the job. A big part.''<P>

   Today, we don't expect starting pitchers to even be in the same area code when the game ends. We're just praying that it takes less than four hours and that we're home in time for the 1 a.m. SportsCenter.<P>

   Pitching is DOA in America.<P>

   You've probably noticed.<P>

   Three of the five highest-scoring days in the major leagues in this century came during the last week of April. There were 826 home runs smashed in 359 games in the first month of the season. That's an average of 2.30 per game, up 64 percent from 1992, the last season before expansion. Runs are up 28 percent from four years ago.<P>

   Before 1996, only three players in baseball history had hit as many as 11 home runs in the month of April. Now, in the span of 30 explosive days, that number has been doubled.<P>

   Where has all the pitching gone? It's drying up at the source.<P>

   ``It's a combination of a lot of factors,'' said Ryan, who was at The Ballpark in Arlington for the TCU-Texas doubleheader during the weekend (he's a limited-earnings assistant coach for the Horned Frogs). ``There's expansion. There's been an increased emphasis on other sports. But most of all, I think it's kids just not throwing as much.''<P>

   Ryan's credo is simple: ``I've always believed that what you don't use, you lose. I just don't believe kids throw as much as they used to. They've got too many other interests, too many other things pulling at them. When we were kids, we didn't stay in the house watching TV. We didn't play video games. We didn't hang out at the mall. We didn't play soccer or street hockey or whatever. We just played ball. Every day. All the time. We played ball.''<P>

   Remember when every vacant lot was an excuse for a ballgame? When you didn't have to have a uniform and an ump to play? When dads and sons (and sometimes daughters, too) just got out in the front yard and played catch?<P>

   ``One of baseball's biggest concerns has to be that overall velocity is down,'' Ryan said. ``Used to be, every spring you'd hear about two or three kids that could really bring it in every camp. Now, if you've got someone who breaks 90, you've got something special.<P>

   ``Even on the college level I can't get the kids to throw like they should. I put 'em on throwing programs, but they don't stick with it.''<P>

   Baseball has itself to blame, as well, because it has also changed. It demands less of its pitchers, so it gets less.<P>

   ``All you hear about now is pitch counts,'' Ryan said. ``That wasn't something you talked about when I was pitching. I averaged 150-170 pitches a game some years and threw over 200 pitches in one game. I started 41 games one year (1974) and completed 26 and didn't lead the league in either category.''<P>

   That was the same season that Ferguson Jenkins was setting the Rangers' record with 29 complete games.<P>

   ``When I was with the Mets, we used to throw 20 minutes of batting practice between starts,'' Ryan said. ``You think the batters and pitchers wouldn't scream if they had to do that today?''<P>

   And then things began to change.<P>

   ``People started managing differently,'' Ryan said. ``It started with Sparky Anderson in Cincinnati in the mid-70s, using four or five guys in each game. Pretty soon we had all sorts of bullpen `specialists.' Long guys, middle guys, set-ups guys, closers. That changed the starters' mind-set. They stopped thinking about completing a game. They just try to get five or six innings in and get it to the guys in the bullpen.''<P>

   There's no magic answer to the problem now.<P>

   ``What do you do, take a Little League team and put it on a throwing program?'' Ryan wondered. ``Kids today are bigger, stronger and they have better equipment and better facilities. Everything is a plus except the results.''<P>

   The results are abundantly plain to see. If April is any indication, we'd best keep a close eye on the record book.
