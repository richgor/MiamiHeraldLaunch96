   We are writing about Marge Schott again, and I keep wondering why.<P>

  She has opened her mouth and pushed her way to the forefront of our thoughts, this time with statements about Adolf Hitler, the misunderstood leader who just needed a bit of guidance, she says.<P>

<BR>
<P>

   I don't want Marge Schott to be part of my thoughts. I don't want to read about her. I don't want to write about her.<P>

   I know there are bigots and racists. They live in my neighborhood, and in yours. I just don't want to give them a public forum. I can't believe Schott still <BR>
has that forum, that public access to shock us and sicken us. What's worse is that when she talked about Hitler on ESPN there were diseased minds out there who shook their heads and said yes.<P>

  She is out front, spouting her thoughts for one reason -- she owns a baseball team. And it's time she didn't.<P>

  I'm disappointed in Bud Selig. If disappointed is the right word.<BR>
Selig should seize opportunity<BR>
<P>

  Selig has a responsibility not only as an owner, but as acting commissioner. He also has a personal burden, because he is Jewish. I can't and won't pretend to understand that burden.<P>

  But I did expect not only a public statement from Selig, but also a personal one.<P>

  Why?<P>

  Because unfortunately that's the only time some people can grasp the true poison of what racism is; they can only understand when it is put on a personal basis. Selig had that opportunity and did not seize it.<P>

  It's his place as acting commissioner to step forward and act like a commissioner.<P>

  I'm not talking about public admonishment of Schott. I'm talking about taking serious action against Schott, an owner whose opinions and attitudes have long tested the limits not only of baseball but of human decency.<P>

  To complain about canceling a game after an umpire died at home plate? To take time out for a few good words on Adolf Hitler?<P>

  Why are we still writing about this woman? Why is she granted this public forum? Why is she allowed to own a major-league baseball team?<BR>
Losing her shock value<BR>
<P>

  We are not even shocked by her anymore.<BR>
 <BR>
  ``I'm not surprised by anything she says,'' said Marlins pitching coach Larry Rothschild, whose father is Jewish and mother is Irish-Catholic. ``I'm just surprised that she hasn't learned to keep her mouth shut.''<P>

  Of course, after her words ripped through us, Schott apologized. Seems she was thinking of some other madman who tried to wipe out a race of people in the 1930s and '40s.<P>

  ``I do not and have never condoned Adolf Hitler's policies of hatred, militarism and genocide. Hitler was one of history's most despicable tyrants,'' Schott said last week.<P>

  Well, with that said, let's play two today.<P>

  Let's just get out the bats and balls and go back to <BR>
playing again. At least until Schott erupts again -- in a month, in a year, in a week -- with another startling insightful view of the world as only Marge can see it.<P>

  What bothers me is she has this podium to speak from. It's time to take it away. Baseball does not deserve Marge Schott. The Reds don't deserve her and neither does Cincinnati.
