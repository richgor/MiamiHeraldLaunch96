   OAKLAND, Calif. -- Ernie Young hit three home runs and Geronimo Berroa and Brent Gates had one apiece as the Athletics routed the Minnesota Twins, 15-5, Friday night in Oakland.<P>

   Young was 4-for-5 with six RBI and four runs scored, helping the A's to season-highs in hits (18) and runs.<P>

   Young connected off Frank Rodriguez (2-4) to start the first and hit his third of the season, a two-run shot off Greg Hansell, during a five-run fifth that included three homers, tying Oakland's team record.<P>

   He hit his third homer, a two-run shot off Latroy Hawkins, in the seventh as part of the A's second five-run inning of the night.<P>

   The three-homer night by Young was his first ever and the first for an Oakland player since Mark McGwire did it at Boston last June 11.<BR>
<LI> Rangers 6, Tigers 2<BR>
TIGERS' WOES CONTINUE<BR>
<P>

   ARLINGTON, Texas -- Roger Pavlik allowed hits to six of the first 12 batters he faced, but settled down and stayed unbeaten.<P>

   Pavlik (5-0) allowed two runs and nine hits in 6 2/3 innings, struck out four and walked two.<P>

   The Rangers have won seven of their last nine games. Detroit lost for the 19th time in 22 games.<P>

   Jose Lima (0-3) gave up five runs and seven hits in six-plus innings for the Tigers, who lowered their team ERA from 7.12 to 7.11.<P>

      ``Right now we have to play the perfect game and it's not happening,'' Tigers Manager Buddy Bell said.<BR>
<LI> White Sox 5, Yankees 2<BR>
TAPANI GETS WIN<BR>
<P>

   CHICAGO -- With David Cone out, possibly for the season, the Yankees said the rest of the team would have to step up. It didn't happen Friday night.<P>

   Kevin Tapani (3-2) combined with two relievers on a three-hitter to lead the host Chicago White Sox over New York, 5-2. It was the Yankees' third loss in their last 11 games.<P>

   Andy Pettitte (5-2) lasted just four innings, giving up five runs -- three earned -- and five hits. He walked four.<P>

   Tapani allowed two hits in seven innings with four strikeouts and four walks.<BR>
<LI> Orioles 10, Brewers 7<BR>
ALOMAR 4-FOR-6<BR>
<P>

   MILWAUKEE -- Jeffrey Hammonds started a three-run rally in the 12th inning with an RBI single off Ramon Garcia, and Baltimore, which had blown two-run leads in the ninth and 10th, held on for the victory.<P>

   Roberto Alomar, who went 4-for-6, added an RBI single off Garcia (0-1), who entered the game in the 10th, and Rafael Palmeiro added another RBI single off Kevin Wickander.<P>

   Jesse Orosco (2-0) got the victory with 1 2/3 innings of scoreless relief and Roger McDowell pitched the 12th for his first save. Garcia (0-1) gave up three earned runs and five hits in 1 2/3.<BR>
<LI> Red Sox 6, Blue Jays 5<BR>
O'LEARY HR WINS IT IN 11TH<BR>
<P>

   TORONTO -- John Valentin tied the game with a two-out homer in the ninth and Troy O'Leary homered in the 11th to lift Boston.<P>

   O'Leary's fifth homer of the season, a drive into the second deck in right off Giovanni Carrara (0-1), gave Boston its sixth win in eight games.<P>

   Heathcliff Slocumb (1-1) pitched 1 2/3 innings and struck out three. He combined with Tom Gordon and Mike Stanton to strike out 17. Gordon struck out 12 in seven innings, allowing four runs and six hits.<P>

   Ed Sprague hit his 10th homer of the season, off Stanton in the eighth to give Toronto a 5-4 lead, but Mike Timlin blew a save chance for the first time in six chances this year when he allowed Valentin's homer.<P>

   Domingo Cedeno had the first four-hit game of his career, going four for five with two RBI.<BR>
Late Thursday<P>

   <LI> Blue Jays 5, Rangers 2: At Arlington, Texas, John Olerud's two-run double in the sixth inning broke up a scoreless game and snapped Ken Hill's string of 19 shutout innings as Toronto halted Texas' five-game winning streak.<P>

   <LI> Royals 8, Angels 2: At Anaheim, Calif., rookie Sal Fasano hit his first major-league homer, a three-run shot in the fifth inning, lifting Kansas City to its fifth straight victory.<P>

   <LI> Orioles 6, White Sox 4: At Chicago, Cal Ripken, in an 0-for-16 slump, blooped a bases-loaded single to key a five-run first inning that boosted Baltimore.
