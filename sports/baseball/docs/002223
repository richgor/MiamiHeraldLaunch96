       The strain of juggling closers <m0>Troy Percival <m0>and <m0>Lee Smith <m0>finally got to Angels Manager <m0>Marcel Lachemann <m0>after he used Percival as a set-up man Wednesday night against Kansas City, only to see Smith blow a save chance.<ep>
   Smith (0-for-2 in save chances, 3.00 ERA) allowed an unearned run in the ninth inning of a game California eventually lost, 3-1, in 14 innings. The crowd of 16,210 (--) aware Percival is 11-for-11 in save chances, has not allowed a run in 13 2/3 innings this season and had retired his last 21 batters in a row (--) booed Smith and the manager.<ep>
   ``Lee is going to be picked on and I'm going to get crucified,'' Lachemann barked at reporters. ``Jump on the wagon. Say what you want. You want to bad-mouth me, fine. You want to come after me, come. It was a decision I made a long time ago, one a lot of people don't like who aren't held accountable for what they say or write. I made a statement I'm held accountable for.''<ep>
   Smith, whom Lachemann promised would regain his closer's job when his strained right knee healed, said, ``I don't like the situation I'm in. Lach feels it's a better team if I'm part of it, but I don't like to feel like I'm in the way. What's bothering me is for him to think he has an obligation to me. His obligation is to the club.''<ep>
   Lachemann wasn't helped when General Manager <m0>Bill Bavasi <m0>said last Sunday that Percival was definitely the team's closer. Bavasi later retracted his statement and said the decision was Lachemann's.<ql>
<m0>Around the league<ep>
<m0> <m0>(box) TIGERS: <m0>Despite having a rotation that entered the weekend with a 6-17 record and 7.12 ERA, M <m0>Buddy Bell <m0>and GM <m0>Randy Smith <m0>are resisting the urge to promote <m0>Justin Thompson, <m0>the team's top draft choice from 1991 who is 3-2 with a 2.51 ERA after seven starts at Class AAA Toledo. Thompson, a left-hander pitching above Class AA for the first time after missing the 1994 season with elbow problems, has walked 14 and struck out 37 in 46 2/3 innings.<ep>
   ``He's been so dominant,'' Bell conceded. ``He's going to be a good pitcher. But we're talking about a 22-year-old kid everybody is waiting to see. It's like he almost can't be good enough, so we're better off giving him the time he needs to develop right.''<ep>
   <m0>(box) MARINERS: <m0>Since being recalled from Tacoma, OF <m0>Darren Bragg <m0>was 8-for-18 (.444) and had two first-inning leadoff homers in his first four games. ``Maybe he thinks he's <m0>Brady Anderson,<m0>'' M <m0>Lou Piniella <m0>said.<ep>
   <m0>(box) ANGELS: <m0>The loss of P <m0>Mark Langston <m0>for 6-8 weeks after knee surgery has the Angels adding knuckleballer <m0>Dennis Springer <m0>to their rotation but looking harder at trade possibilities with the Astros <m0>(Greg Swindell <m0>or <m0>Doug Brocail) <m0>and Padres <m0>(Tim Worrell <m0>or <m0>Scott Sanders).<m0><ep>
   <m0>(box) WHITE SOX: <m0>Spinal surgery has probably ended the comeback attempt of reliever <m0>Bobby Thigpen, <m0>who had a 7.11 ERA in four appearances for Class AAA Nashville. ``It's too bad,'' Chicago GM <m0>Ron Schueler <m0>said. ``His velocity was just starting to come back.'' . . . P <m0>Jason Bere <m0>and INF <m0>Norberto Martin <m0>will begin their rehabilitation assignments at Nashville next week.<ep>
  <m0>(box) ORIOLES: <m0>Baltimore is looking at San Diego's <m0>Tim Worrell, Scott Sanders <m0>and <m0>Willie Blair <m0>as possible arms to bolster their rotation, and shortstop <m0>Manny Alexander <m0>has the Padres' interest.<ep>
