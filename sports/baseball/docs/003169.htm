  The Marlins activated reliever Jay Powell Friday and shocked pitcher Dave Weathers by sending him to Charlotte.<P>

  ``I don't like it. There's nothing I can do about it,'' said Weathers who pitched all spring amid trade rumors. ``I don't think it's fair. You can take a look at my numbers, but I only had two bad innings. If you take those away, I'm in the 2s'' in earned-run <BR>
average.<P>

  Weathers had an ERA of 2.55 May 1, but he walked four in a row (one intentional) last week against Philadelphia, gave up five runs in two innings against the Rockies in Colorado, and gave up a run in the ninth inning Thursday to send his ERA to 5.19.<P>

  ``If I could, I would trade myself,'' Weathers said. ``Nobody wants to go to Triple A. I'm not saying I don't want to be with the Marlins, but I don't want to go to Triple A. I don't know what I have to do there, go 10-0? I don't know what I have to work on. This is my third year in the big leagues. I know I'll do well in Triple A.''<P>

  Weathers was so upset, he asked General Manager Dave Dombrowski for alternatives. Dombrowski told Weathers he had to report to Charlotte in 72 hours or he would be suspended.<P>

  ``He wanted to know about a trade,'' Dombrowski said. ``We're not going to give him away for nothing. There was a lot of debate. He had a good spring. We still think he is a big-league pitcher, but he hasn't thrown the ball that well.''<P>

   <LI> Powell, who has yet to allow an earned run this season, pitched a perfect eighth inning Friday night.<BR>
Injury report<BR>
<P>

  <LI> SS Kurt Abbott has excess fluid in one of his ears and is taking medication to relieve it. Abbott will see a series of doctors next week, including an allergy specialist, in an attempt to find the problem for his dizziness.<P>

  <LI> 2B Quilvio Veras had an MRI on Friday, and the Marlins are hoping for the best. The injury is not in the same place in the hamstring as an earlier injury, and the Marlins hope Veras can be back in 15 days.<P>

  ``It's much better today than it was yesterday,'' said Marlins trainer Larry Starr.<P>

  <LI> P Alejandro Pe&ntilde;a, who has been on the DL with a slight tear of the rotator cuff since April 17, began a light-toss program Friday.
