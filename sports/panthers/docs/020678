<m1><ep>
<m0>  The Panthers' top two scorers of the 1995-96 season have been married as linemates most of the campaign. With each going through tough times in the playoffs, they and the coaching staff <m4>Niedermayer  <m2><ql>
<m0>agreed a trial separation might help.<ep>
   Going into tonight's Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinal with Philadelphia, right wing Scott Mellanby and third-year center Rob Niedermayer have a total of three playoff points. And three is not a magic number after 14 playoff games.<ep>
   ``It's fortunate that a lot of other guys have stepped up, but for us to win this series, we have to contribute,'' Mellanby said.<ep>
   As a line, Mellanby, Niedermayer and Johan Garpenlov have five playoff points, the same as defensive defenseman Paul Laus. So, they were split over the past two days. Garpenlov was scratched for Game 3 and doesn't know if he'll be back in Game 4.<ep>
   ``I didn't like the way he played the last two games,'' Panthers Coach Doug MacLean replied when asked about Garpenlov's benching.<ep>
   Then, in practice Wednesday, with left wing Bill Lindsay sitting out with a swollen eye, Garpenlov skated with Mellanby and Tom Fitzgerald. Niedermayer was with Radek Dvorak, who played with he and Mellanby Tuesday, and Martin Straka.<ep>
   ``I'm part of the Czech Republic,'' Niedermayer laughed.<ep>
   Mellanby, too, has retained his sense of humor, chuckling, ``It would be nice to get some kind of bounce. I'd take one like Mario got last night. I'd actually take one off <m0>my  <m0>face.''<ep>
   Pittsburgh's Lemieux figured out yet another way to score Tuesday night against the Rangers when a shot went off his noggin, off Ulf Samuelsson's face . . . nothing but net. Lemieux got credit for the goal as the last Penguin to touch the puck.<ep>
   Actually, that goal demonstrates something neither Niedermayer nor Mellanby has been doing in the postseason: when in doubt, fire at the net, the way Laus did to get Florida's lone goal Tuesday night. Combined, Niedermayer and Mellanby are averaging two shots a game.<ep>
   Early in Game 3, Mellanby had two defenders occupied when Niedermayer picked up the puck in the right face-off circle, a usual shooting spot for him. Instead he tried to pass back to Mellanby, who was being hauled down for a penalty on Philadelphia. A Niedermayer shot would have yielded as much and at least the possibility of a goal.<ep>
   ``Sometimes, there's a little bit of confidence lacking when you haven't scored in a while so you tend to do that,'' MacLean said.<ep>
   After Mellanby cracked that he always shoots because he doesn't have the skills to do otherwise, he said of Niedermayer, ``He's got a great shot, and we want to use it.''<ep>
   ``I really have to have more of a shoot-first mentality,'' said Niedermayer, who hasn't experienced a slump like this since his first year playing juniors in Medicine Hat. ``You look at the goals scored in the playoffs, you just have to get the puck at the net.''<ep>
   Perhaps that will produce the break that both Mellanby and Niedermayer feel they need. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``It's frustrating because I didn't feel we were that far away,'' Mellanby said.<ep>
   ``The last three games have been a lot better,'' Niedermayer said. ``I'm starting to skate better, do the little things . . . it's starting to come. I can feel it starting to come.''<ep>
   Tuesday, they were joined by Dvorak, who missed the net when Rhett Warrener sent him in one-on-one with Philadelphia goalie Ron Hextall, saw a drive from the slot stopped and saw a two-on-one with Niedermayer broken up.<ep>
   ``He's a guy who could use a break,'' Mellanby said.<ep>
   ``Dvorak had a couple of great chances, but the tough part is he's 18 years old in alone on a veteran goalie,'' MacLean said.<ep>
   (box) Flyers fans, Philadelphia media and ESPN's <m0>Barry Melrose <m0>chorused that Panthers followers should quit whining about <m0>Eric Lindros' <m0>stickwork during Game 2. Either accept it as ``playoff hockey'' or get Lindros back when the game doesn't matter.<ep>
   Yet, when Panthers defenseman <m0>Ed Jovanovski<m0> took a swing at Lindros as time ran out Tuesday, it was considered an undisciplined act in the Philadelphia media.<ep>
   Jovanovski said it wasn't premeditated, but he shouldn't have to tolerate Lindros' extraneous run after slapping the puck the length of the ice to run out the clock.<ep>
   ``I could've raised the puck and tried to hurt someone, but I kept it on the ice,'' Jovanovski said. ``It was the heat of the moment. Whatever happens (--) a misconduct or whatever (--) isn't going to change the game.''<ep>
   (box) Flyers goalie <m0>Ron Hextall, <m0>a man with a sullied reputation himself, said of the hullabaloo over Lindros, ``Nobody wants to be called a cheap player and anybody who says that [about Lindros] is extremely uneducated.''<ql>
