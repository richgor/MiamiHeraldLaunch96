<m0>   The Panthers wanted Rob Niedermayer to shoot <m1> <m0>more, and so he did. They needed somebody to set the tone for the evening, and he did that, too. They wanted a quick score, and so Niedermayer found a loose puck a minute into the game and took it to <m4>Niedermayer<m2><ql>
<m0>the goal.<ep>
  What he did next turned things around for the Panthers and for Niedermayer himself. He slipped past Philadelphia's Eric Desjardins and beat Ron Hextall for an unassisted goal.<ep>
  A huge load suddenly was off his back. A nightmarish eight-game goal-less streak <m1> <m0>was over. His confidence was back. The Panthers were back.<ep>
  ``I was really trying to get that first one,'' Niedermayer said following the Panthers' 4-3 overtime victory in Game 4 of the best-of-seven series. ``It had been a long time. It was nice to get that first one out of the way.''<ep>
  But Niedermayer's resurrection wasn't finished. Seven minutes later, he scored again. The Panthers needed a big game out of Niedermayer, and the 21-year-old center delivered.<ep>
  ``Robbie was outstanding for us,'' said teammate Dave Lowry, who got the winner 4:06 into overtime. ``We needed a big game out of him. After he got that first goal he relaxed a little bit.''<ep>
  In eight playoff games entering Thursday night, Niedermayer had just one assist. No goals. A minus-four rating. A huge confidence problem.<ep>
  When Niedermayer loses confidence, he passes when he ought to shoot. That had been the case during the first three games of this series. Before Game 4, Coach Doug MacLean told the media Niedermayer needed to shoot more.<ep>
  ``I guess he was right,'' Niedermayer said. ``That was the first time I've ever paid attention to anything in the newspapers.''<ep>
  MacLean thought a line change might help his franchise center find the trigger, and that worked too. Instead of Scott Mellanby and Johan Garpenlov (--) with whom Niedermayer had formed a potent No. 1 line during the season (--) Niedermayer was paired with Radek Dvorak and Martin Straka.<ep>
  ``Maybe we needed that new life,'' Niedermayer said. ``With our new linemates, we did that. It was a good change for the team.''<ep>
  MacLean had stressed that Niedermayer wasn't an invisible man. Even when he wasn't scoring, Niedermayer was doing little things that coaches.<ep>
  Thursday night was no different. Niedermayer banged. He played solid defense. Most of all, he came up with loose pucks. One of those loose pucks, which Niedermayer tracked down in the neutral zone with 2:24 left in regulation, almost gave him a hat trick.<ep>
  The point was made: Niedermayer was back. <m1><ep>
<m0>  ``I was glad to see Rob Niedermayer jump to the forefront with a big game,'' MacLean said. ``Two goals and a couple of other big plays. Outstanding game.''<ql>
