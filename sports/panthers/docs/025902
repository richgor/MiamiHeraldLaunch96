  Just put it on net, pal. That's all you do in playoff sudden death overtime. Just send it at the net and let something happen, something like a career grinder turned playoff goal-scorer deflecting in a little team history.<ep>
  When Panthers rookie defenseman Ed Jovanovski gathered in a loose puck just inside the Philadelphia blueline in overtime Thursday night, he did what he and the team always say they do best: <m4>    <m2><ql>
<m0>keep things simple. His wrister skimmed off the stick of Dave Lowry, now the Panthers' top postseason goal scorer, and into a net that was being raised off its back by Panthers right wing Scott Mellanby.<ep>
  One video replay later, and, voila, the Panthers had won their first overtime playoff game in team history, 4-3. This team that hasn't won a regular season overtime game since Dec. 2, 1993 took only 4:06 to win one in the playoffs after the Flyers had scored with 1:07 left in regulation to send it into overtime.<ep>
  ''I'm glad we lost a few during the regular season and saved for this one,'' Panthers Coach Doug MacLean said.<ep>
  Back to Philadelphia this Eastern Conference semifinal goes for a Sunday afternoon Game 5, just as tied as it was when it opened there a week ago. Tickets go on sale for Game 6, Tuesday at Miami Arena, at 10 a.m. today.<ql>
<m0>A quick protest<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  The puck hadn't hit the ice, never mind the first celebratory toy rat, when the Flyers began protesting, led by goalie Ron Hextall. <ep>
  ``First, I thought it was off his skate,'' Hextall said. ``Second, the net was off and it says in the rule book that when the net is off, it's no goal.''<ql>
<m1><styl>mugr,3l,6p6,10p6   <ue5><ql>
<ep>
<m0>  Rule 55(a) says the goal frame has to be ``in its proper position.'' The replay showed that the puck crossed the line as Mellanby had blundered into the back of the goal while battling behind the net with the Philadelphia defense. The net was still on its <m4>    <m2><ql>
<m0>moorings, at the posts. Lowry clearly had redirected it in with his stick.<ep>
  ``Eddie made a great play in our end to break up the rush and bring it out,'' Lowry said. ``I wanted it before, but he made a soft dump-in. Scott and I wanted to get pressure on their defensemen. I didn't know Scott had thrown it back. I thought we were in trouble because the puck got past us. Eddie made a great shot.''<ep>
  Lowry, who had 10 goals all season, now has six in the playoffs to lead the Panthers.<ep>
  ``Dave Lowry has been The Man for us in the playoffs,'' Panthers goalie John Vanbiesbrouck said. ``Well, everybody's been The Man for us, but he's scored some big goals for us.''<ep>
  Vanbiesbrouck was The Man during a 24-shot second period (a Flyers' team playoff record) and 3:20 into the extra period. Philadelphia's Dale Hawerchuk was given the liberty to walk through the left faceoff circle, fire on the Florida goal and take a poke at the loose rebound between Vanbiesbrouck's skates. Vanbiesbrouck went down, but kept the puck out. As additional bodies flew into the crease, the puck flew out to safety.<ep>
  ``We got into OT and felt real good,'' Lindros said. ``We had the puck between his legs and couldn't tap it in.''<ql>
<m0>New life for Flyers<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Philadelphia should have felt good getting into overtime after being a Kerry Huffman stick and Niedermayer shot from being out in regulation.<ep>
  Huffman, a defenseman picked up by Philadelphia from Ottawa at the trade deadline, saw a clear skip past him at the Panthers blueline with 2:24 left in regulation. Niedermayer, with two first period goals that gave the Panthers a 2-0 lead, took off after it.<ep>
  This race should have been no contest with Niedermayer racing away toward a possible hat trick and game-clinching goal. But Huffman began hooking him repeatedly while keeping his feet moving so he wasn't Saskatoon water skiing, which would have commanded referee Rob Shick slap him with a hooking call.<ep>
  Instead, Niedermayer was off balance when he finally escaped Huffman's stick in the circle and managed merely a desperate shot while falling. Hextall stopped it just before Niedermayer steamrolled him and Huffman cleared the rebound from an empty cage.<ep>
  Now, the last thing you want to do is give up the zone too easily and the Panthers were retreating as the Flyers crossed the line as the clocked ticked toward the final minute. Soon, everybody lost their defensive assignments, so Mikael Renberg was free to get the necessary two whacks needed to tie the game with 1:07 left in regulation.<ep>
