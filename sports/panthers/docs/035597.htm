  While South Florida hockey fans are busy fixating on the penalties called in the Flyers-Panthers series -- or, perhaps, the penalties they think should have been called -- they might want to look at what the Panthers do when the Flyers actually spend time in the penalty box.<P>

   Which is to say: not much.<P>

   In Tuesday's 3-1 loss, Florida did not get so much as one  shot off in its first two power plays. The only goal of the evening was at even strength. In the first two games of the series, the Panthers did score two power-play goals. But those were more the result of poor clears by Philadelphia than of solid Panthers play.<P>

   The Flyers, of course, scored their first two goals on the power plays that resulted from the two two-minute minors Brian Skrudland got for high sticking Rod Brind'Amour during a face-off.<P>

   The Flyers have excelled at penalty-killing all season, finishing second in the league, including killing 22 of 23 power plays in five regular-season games against the Panthers. So, on the bright side, the two power-play goals early in the series doubled the number the Panthers scored on the Flyers all season.<P>

   On the dim side, though, the Flyers are third in the league in penalty-killing for the playoffs, allowing just five goals in 47 minutes of short-handed play. The Panthers, on the other hand, have scored just seven goals on 42 attempts in power plays, 12th of the 16 playoff teams.<P>

   ``We've picked up our defense since Game 1,'' said Shjon Podein, one of the Flyers' two primary penalty-killers. ``We're doing a good job holding the shots down. It's not much different than what we've done before. We try to be aggressive in all three zones and hopefully there will be a turnover.''<P>

   On Tuesday, Joel Otto, the point man for Flyers penalty killing, spent much of his time in his own defensive zone, preventing the Panthers from getting their sticks on the puck, let alone moving it up ice and anywhere near Flyers goalie Ron Hextall. Hextall faced just two shots in the entire first period. <P>

   ``We take a lot of pride in being good on penalty killing,'' said Otto, who, at 6-4, 225, can make for an immovable object around which to move the puck. ``We rotated a lot of guys in there so we were always fresh. We played with fear of how well they play here. The fear of coming to a building that was very loud.''<P>

   Fear, and knowledge that Miami Arena's sloppy ice affects the number of quality of shots teams take. Humidity in South Florida makes the Arena's ice soft.<P>

   ``The ice makes a difference,'' Hextall said. ``It's basically you dump the puck in and you bang around for rebounds.''<P>

   But Hextall's skill in playing the puck -- he likes to knock it down and whip it out on his own -- has given pause to the Panthers' normal plan of dumping the puck in and chasing on the power play. <P>

   ``I don't know about [being] apprehensive,'' Stu Barnes said. ``The wraparound slapper might not work as well. He's like an extra player back there.''<BR>
