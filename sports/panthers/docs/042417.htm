 WHO HAS THE EDGE? <BR>
<BR>
<PRE>PANTHERS EDGE FLYERS 

</PRE>
<BR>
<BR>
Offense: Speed makes the Panthers a dangerous forechecking team and they'll get a few scoring chances just from beating the Flyers to loose pucks. Also, they force some takedowns that are too blatant to ignore too often.  Defense: Not only is Ron Hextall an incredibly imposing goalie, he's a third defenseman who helps them clear dump-ins with great efficiency. The defensemen drain forwards' energy with their multiple obstruction style. <BR>
<BR>
Defense: Robert Svehla, Terry Carkner, Ed Jovanovski, Rhett Warrener and Paul Laus will enjoy the challenge of taking on the Flyers physically. They'll need to move the puck quickly to prevent the Flyers from getting a good cycle going in the Panthers' zone.  Offense: Lindros, LeClair, Hawerchuk, Renberg, Otto . . . the Flyers are deep in talent up front and when they get going, defenders seem intimidated by both their size and talent. They'll have to work from their own end, however, because their defensemen aren't great at carrying the puck, Eric Desjardins and Petr Svoboda notwithstanding. <BR>
<BR>
Goaltending: John Vanbiesbrouck has been the perfect playoff goalie, making the saves when necessary and not giving up a bad goal. Mark Fitzpatrick gives the Panthers a big edge in the No. 2 slot.  Goaltending: Hextall is a good goalie against the Panthers' north-south attack and has given up only four goals in three games against Florida this season. He can be sloppy however, and the Flyers have no quality backup if he slumps or goes down. <BR>
<BR>
Special teams: The Panthers were the worst penalty killing team among the first-rounders and gave up two shorthanded goals. Ray Sheppard gives the Panthers something they didn't have during the regular season when Florida scored once on the power play in five games against Philly.  Special teams: One of the best penalty-killing units during the regular season continued its sharp play in shutting down Tampa Bay's power play in Round 1. The Flyers are deadly on the power play once they gain the zone with their bulk and puckhandling ability. <BR>
<BR>
Coaching: The coaching staff has been expert in helping the team perk at a high, but not feverish, emotional level. Also, they aren't afraid to go with whomever is playing well, be they the children or the aged.  Coaching: Terry Murray has been this way before, with Washington and Philadelphia. He didn't panic last series when down, 2-1, so don't expect him to do so here. <BR>
<BR>
Intangibles: They're in the position they like best: underdogs with nothing to lose. If they steal a game in Philadelphia, they might be able to drain the Flyers in a steamy Miami Arena, where the Panthers have been super in the playoffs.  Intangibles: The Flyboys aren't just happy to be here -- they're thinking Cup. Also, even should they score an early rout, the lessons of Round 1 will prevent cockiness for the succeeding games. <BR>
