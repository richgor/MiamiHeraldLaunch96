   Panthers General Manager Bryan Murray was voted The Sporting News' executive of the year by his peers, the second time in three seasons Florida's GM has been so honored. Bob Clarke, now the Flyers GM, won the award for the 1993-94 season. Ironically, Murray said he voted for Clarke this year.<P>

   ``Anytime anybody off-ice gets any recognition, it has to do with the players,'' Murray said. ``Obviously, bringing Doug and the coaching staff in had a lot to do with it.''<P>

   Panthers President Bill Torrey completed a Florida sweep of the top two spots.<P>

   ``I don't know how I nosed him out -- he's so much older,'' joked Murray, who credited Torrey's honoring to ``such great enthusiasm down here about this franchise and the selling of hockey in the South Florida market.''<P>

   In the issue due out Wednesday, coach of the year saw Panthers Coach Doug MacLean tied for second with the state's other NHL coach, Terry Crisp. Detroit's Scotty Bowman was first. Ed Jovanovski was third behind Ottawa's Daniel Alfredsson and Chicago's Eric Daze in rookie of the year voting.<P>

   <LI> Tonight will see the return of Panthers defenseman Gord Murphy from a fractured foot injury suffered April 8 against the Rangers. Whom Murphy will replace hasn't been decided. What also hasn't been decided, but is being kicked around, is what line adjustments the Panthers will make.<P>

   <LI> That the Panthers are the hot sports topic in South Florida was made apparent to MacLean recently.<P>

   ``I was on the beach, and I know it's not because of my body that I was recognized,'' MacLean said. ``I do look good in a bathing suit, though.''<P>

   <LI> Jason Podollan, one of the last cuts in training camp, is practicing with the team following his team's elimination from the Western Hockey League playoffs.
