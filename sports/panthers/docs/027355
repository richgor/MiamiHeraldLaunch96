  In the mirror, the Panthers see another four lines and three defensive pairs, all defensively stingy and playing equally well; there's another goaltender who's disarming his playoff skeptics with a playoff performance similar to that of his 1980s youth; and there are other important players acquired by a nomadic manager who can't leave home years after he couldn't stay home.<ep>
  Tonight, it commences, this second playoff series in Panthers history, the one entitled <m0>Through the Looking Glass and What the Panthers Found There<m0>.<ep>
  It won't be Wonderland, that's for sure. Not when what waits on the other side of the mirror is the Philadelphia Flyers, the league leaders in height, weight, fearsome reputation and fans who know how to insult opposing players personally.<ep>
  Yet, there isn't much difference between the Super-Sized and Sullen in Philadelphia and the high energy underdogs from Florida.<ep>
  Panthers President Bill Torrey, who worked with then-Florida general manager Bob Clarke on the expansion draft, said, ``Bob and I like the same kind of players. We have to get the kind of players out of the Bobby Clarke mold (--) they don't have his talent, but every faceoff, every scrimmage, they're going hell bent for leather.''<ep>
  ``We have a lot of similar players to Florida (--) guys who work every night, who know how to keep the puck out of our net,'' said Clarke, now Philadelphia's GM. ``Both have enough skill. Both teams have got goaltenders that are successful.''<ql>
<m1>Successful goalies<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Those goalies, Philadelphia's Ron Hextall and Florida's John Vanbiesbrouck, have another round to silence the critics who have howled at their door since they took center stage in 1986 (Vanbiesbrouck won the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goalie) and 1987 (Hextall won the Conn Smythe Trophy as Playoff MVP, though the Flyers lost the Finals).<ep>
  While the Flyers always have loved to crowd the slot with big bodies and will do so again on Vanbiesbrouck, it might be more important to the Panthers' success that they take up residence in Hextall's personal space.<ep>
  ``The first thing we have to do is get on Hextall,'' Panthers defenseman Paul Laus said. ``If you get on him quick, get him frustrated, maybe he'll start swinging his stick. He's played well for them.''<ep>
  Hextall was one of the first players brought back to Philadelphia when Clarke skedaddled from his Florida job after the Panthers' initial season, a migration that cost Philadelphia $500,000 and a second-round 1994 draft pick to avoid tampering charges.<ep>
  After earning plaudits for helping put together the most successful first-season team in the major pro sports expansion era, Clarke hasn't misstepped since going back to Philadelphia.<ep>
  Clarke's most brilliant deal saw him send All-Star forward Mark Recchi to Montreal for Eric Desjardins and John LeClair. Desjardins has been Philly's best defenseman and LeClair completed the Legion of Doom and became a 50-goal man this year.<ep>
  In addition to Hextall, Clarke also retrieved another former Flyer, Kjell Samuelsson. Through this season, he's picked up forwards Dale Hawerchuk, Bob Corkum and Dan Quinn.<ql>
<m1>Stronger Cup threat<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   New four-line depth makes Philadelphia a much greater Stanley Cup threat than last season when the Flyers reached the semis solely on the strength of the LeClair-Eric Lindros-Mikael Renberg line. Such is Philadelphia's depth, Coach Terry Murray successfully broke up The Legion and came out the better for it against Tampa Bay.<ep>
  Though the Panthers still have 14 players Clarke brought in and a few others for which he was indirectly responsible, Clarke said, ``I think the team went as far as it did because of the changes Bryan Murray made.''<ep>
  Each team is led in playoff scoring by a late-season pickup (--) Hawerchuk for Philadelphia, right wing Ray Sheppard for Florida. The Sheppard heist from San Jose has worked so well, Bryan Murray might have to do some hard-time the next time he goes to California. Sheppard is one of the reasons Panthers Coach Doug MacLean feels comfortable going in against the Eastern Conference's Cup favorite.<ep>
  ``We played well against Philadelphia in the regular season, and we're a better team now,'' MacLean said. ``I like the way our lines are set up. We have two really good grinding lines that are scoring and two offensive lines that are scoring. Moving Tom Fitzgerald to center made us a stronger forechecking team and a stronger checking team overall. We're more balanced.''<ep>
  Fitzgerald's line is one of three lines the Panthers will throw at Eric Lindros and whomever his linemates are, be it LeClair and Hawerchuk or LeClair and Renberg. The defense pairs of Terry Carkner-Robert Svehla and Paul Laus-Ed Jovanovski also will be rotated against Philadelphia's top man.<ep>
  No opponent has more points against the Panthers than Lindros has over the past three seasons.<ep>
  ``I'm not sure you can get him off his game,'' Scott Mellanby said. ``His game is any game he wants to play. If you mean get him angry, he's human with emotions. But, do you want to do that?''<ep>
   ``He's such an all-around player, he's tough to stop,'' Laus said. ``You want to make sure he doesn't pick up speed. He's 235 pounds. Once he does, he's like a truck out there barreling through. We're going to have to slow him down and use our team speed on the forecheck.''<ep>
  Panthers left wing Mike Hough said, ``A quick pace . . . if we can keep it a fast-paced game, maybe we can tire out some of their big guys.''<ep>
  On the other side of the looking glass, the Flyers know this, just as the Panthers won't be stunned by anything the Flyers do. Each knows each other too well after too many hard, emotional regular-season games over three seasons.<ep>
  But, tonight, the mirror cracks.<ql>
