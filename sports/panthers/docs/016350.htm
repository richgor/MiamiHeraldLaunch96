   The goal at the end, the overtime goal that finished the Flyers against the Florida Panthers, was disputed. But the actual cause of the loss really was not.<P>

The search for clues and culprits was assiduous after Thursday night's game, but the truth was right there on the scoresheet for everyone to see.<P>

   On a night when Mikael Renberg emerged from the inju<BR>
ry-induced shadows, a night when Renberg scored two goals and looked like Renberg again, the emotional boost from his re-emergence was wasted.<P>

   By what?<P>

   By the first period. By two Rob Niedermayer goals in the first nine minutes that left the Flyers in a position of playing from behind all night.<P>

   ``I think we played a pretty good game,'' Renberg said. ``[Florida goaltender John] Vanbiesbrouck played really well. We had a lot of chances. We took a lot of shots. But we gave up those two goals at the beginning. If we hadn't done that, we would've won the game.''<P>

   All around him, the topic was the officiating. The final goal in overtime was the immediate cause. Was it off Dave Lowry's stick or skate? Was the net on or off its moorings? Who knocked it off and when did he knock it?<P>

   It took a conversation with the replay official before Shick finally certified the goal. With that, the Panthers tied this Eastern Conference semifinal series at 2-2. Renberg's big night was wasted. The fact that the Flyers have outplayed the Panthers about 75 percent of the time in this series became superfluous.<P>

   It's still tied. And the Panthers are, indeed, going to be a murderously difficult out for the Flyers.<P>

   Complaining about the officiating in this sport is a total waste of human breath. How can you complain about a refereeing system where the guy can't possibly see about 30 percent of what happens on the ice? How can you even bother yelling about a system where one guy -- Shick, Thursday night -- can blow his whistle until he's in need of an oxygen hit, and another guy -- Andy Van Hellemond, the NHL's senior referee -- probably hasn't called a penalty in overtime since some time in the late '70s.<P>

   Both officiating styles are tolerated, sometimes on alternating evenings. All everybody does is shrug, mostly because there are few productive alternatives.<P>

   Was the Panthers' winning goal really a goal?<P>

   Tough to tell.<P>

   Could have gone either way.<P>

The controversy makes for interesting reading, but it isn't the story of the night or the series. That story is far more complicated. The Flyers' problem now is finding a way to capitalize on the fact that they're the better team here. The Flyers' job is to be both talented and timely as we enter the one-false-move-could-be-fatal stage of this series.
