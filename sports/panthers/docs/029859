<m0>   Tickets for Game 6, scheduled for 7:35 p.m. Tuesday at Miami Arena, go on sale at 10 a.m. today at the Miami Arena box office and through Ticketmaster (358-5885 in Dade, 954-523-3309 in Broward and 407-966-3309 in Palm Beach).<ep>
   About 3,000 seats are available (--) Panther Pack ($15), goal zone ($30), sideline balcony ($34) and mezzanine ($40).<ql>
<m0>Sheppard scratched<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The Panthers' leading playoff scorer, right wing <m0>Ray Sheppard, <m0>missed Game 4 with a bruised shoulder. Sheppard should be ready for Sunday's Game 5 in Philadelphia.<ep>
  Also scratched for Game 4 was defenseman <m0>Gord Murphy, <m0>who played his first game in three weeks Tuesday.<ql>
<m0>Fans quiet at start<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  The Miami Arena crowd, obnoxious past a fault Tuesday, began Thursday much tamer.<ep>
   The national anthem was not only audible, but fewer toy rats hit the ice and no golf balls, as was the case during Thursday's rendition.<ql>
<m0>Lindsay plays hurt<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The right eye of Panthers left wing <m0>Bill Lindsay <m0>was barely open, but provided enough vision for him to play Thursday night.<ql>
<m0>Svehla breaks nose<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The Panthers lost defenseman <m0>Robert Svehla <m0>to a broken nose suffered 2:23 into the game. As Svehla dived for a lost puck, the skate of Philadelphia center <m0>Eric Lindros <m0>unintentionally came back and caught him. Svehla also suffered a cut lip and lost some teeth.<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   (box) Philadelphia sat tough guy left wing <m0>Shawn Antoski <m0>as <m0>Rob DiMaio <m0>returned to the lineup. DiMaio missed the last eight games of the season and the first nine Flyers playoff games with a sprained right knee.<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   (box) In a strange if justifiable first in Florida's brief history, the Panthers and Flyers had to play the last 3.6 seconds of the first period before they could start the second.<ep>
  The Panthers' <m0>Brian Skrudland <m0>flipped the puck over the glass with 3.6 seconds left, but the clock kept running. The Flyers, a great face-off team, protested vehemently as the draw would have been in the Panthers' end. Skrudland tied up Lindros on the face-off and time expired.<ql>
