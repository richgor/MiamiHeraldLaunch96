  By firing 46 shots at Panthers goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, the Philadelphia Flyers should have expected more bang for their pucks. But Vanbiesbrouck stopped or swatted away 43 of the salvos and provided the defensive backbone in a 4-3 overtime victory Thursday night for the Panthers.<ep>
  ``John Vanbiesbrouck was stellar in between the pipes,'' Panthers center Brian Skrudland said. ``He made unbelievable stops, but that doesn't surprise anyone in this dressing room tonight.''<ep>
  Said Panthers Coach Doug MacLean: ``He was outstanding. You say that every night, and it's fact.''<ep>
  Fact was, Vanbiesbrouck plugged the net for the first 34 minutes of the game, made it impervious to pucks. Pad stops. Stick stops. Glove saves. On-his-back sprawling saves.<ep>
  Philadelphia launched 20 shots at Vanbiesbrouck in the first 9 1/2 minutes of the second period, not one of them finding their way past the Panthers goaltender.<ep>
  It wasn't until late in the second period that the Flyers found a way past Vanbiesbrouck, with Mikael Renberg scoring with just under four minutes left and Rod Brind'Amour following with a power-play goal a minute later to tie the score. <ep>
  Vanbiesbrouck continued to play netblocker in the third period until Renberg shoved the puck in with 1:07 left in regulation.<ep>
  That score sent the game into overtime and left Vanbiesbrouck depressed.<ep>
  ``It was pretty tough for me to shake off,'' Vanbiesbrouck said.<ep>
  If the goaltender was feeling down, he didn't stay so for long. Dave Lowry scored the game-winner four minutes into OT.<ep>
  Many of the Panthers credited Vanbiesbrouck for his performance.<ep>
  ``Johnny stood on his head again for us,'' Lowry said as he came off the ice after the victory.<ep>
  Vanbiesbrouck, in nine playoff games, has a save percentage of .933, allowing a 23 goals while saving 322.<ep>
  ``It was a little frustrating at times,'' Vanbiesbrouck said of his performance Thursday. ``They hit us with a pretty good barrage [in the second period] and we survived it. We showed character in the second period after they tied it and we scored late to go ahead. That really lifted our spirits.''<ep>
  And Vanbiesbrouck lifted the Panthers.<ep>
