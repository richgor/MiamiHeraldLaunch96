   Panthers General Manager <m0>Bryan Murray <m0>was voted The Sporting News' executive of the year by his peers, the second time in three seasons Florida's GM has been so honored. <m0>Bob Clarke, <m0>now the Flyers GM, won the award for the 1993-94 season. Ironically, Murray said he voted for Clarke this year.<ep>
   ``Anytime anybody off-ice gets any recognition, it has to do with the players,'' Murray said. ``Obviously, bringing Doug and the coaching staff in had a lot to do with it.''<ep>
   Panthers President <m0>Bill Torrey <m0>completed a Florida sweep of the top two spots.<ep>
   ``I don't know how I nosed him out (--) he's so much older,'' joked Murray, who credited Torrey's honoring to ``such great enthusiasm down here about this franchise and the selling of hockey in the South Florida market.''<ep>
   In the issue due out Wednesday, coach of the year saw Panthers Coach <m0>Doug MacLean <m0>tied for second with the state's other NHL coach, <m0>Terry Crisp. <m0>Detroit's <m0>Scotty Bowman <m0>was first. <m0>Ed Jovanovski <m0>was third behind Ottawa's <m0>Daniel Alfredsson <m0>and Chicago's <m0>Eric Daze <m0>in rookie of the year voting.<ep>
   (box) Tonight will see the return of Panthers defenseman <m0>Gord Murphy <m0>from a fractured foot injury suffered April 8 against the Rangers. Whom Murphy will replace hasn't been decided. What also hasn't been decided, but is being kicked around, is what line adjustments the Panthers will make.<ep>
   (box) That the Panthers are the hot sports topic in South Florida was made apparent to MacLean recently.<ep>
   ``I was on the beach, and I know it's not because of my body that I was recognized,'' MacLean said. ``I do look good in a bathing suit, though.''<ep>
   <m0>(box) Jason Podollan, <m0>one of the last cuts in training camp, is practicing with the team following his team's elimination from the Western Hockey League playoffs.<ep>
