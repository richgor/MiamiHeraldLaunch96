  Eric Lindros and Ed Jovanovski were not exchanging home phone numbers when they crossed paths Wednesday night. Not talking about golf. Not asking about the family.<ep>
  That wouldn't have allowed time for the gesturing, the jawing, the posturing.<ep>
  There are friendly rivalries in sports. This burgeoning grudge between one of hockey's biggest stars and one of its sparkling rookies is not one of them.<ep>
  This match has been developing all season. But it is in this series that the two have become close, sometimes a bit too close.<ep>
  ``It's a challenge,'' Jovanovski said. ``You're playing against one of the best in the league. To play him solid is a great feeling.''<ep>
  In Game 2, as every rabid South Florida fan knows by now, Lindros used his stick for a two-handed swing at Jovanovski's knees. He also delivered an elbow when the two were coming off their benches. In one shift, the two met twice. Lindros came down the right board, only to be met by a Jovanovski hit and steal of the puck. Later, Jovanovski rode Lindros hard, dropping him again. That's when Lindros uttered the now immortal challenge: ``Hit me. Hit me.''<ep>
  Jovanovski didn't. That time.<ep>
  Wednesday, he made up for it.<ep>
  Midway through the first period, Jovanovski leveled Lindros with a brutal hit. Seconds later, Lindros skated over to Jovanovski (--) neither was anywhere near the puck (--) to deliver retribution.<ep>
  ``It has been clean,'' Jovanovski said. ``Taking the body is part of my game. It's part of his.''<ep>
  In the second period, the happy couple was leaving the ice. Skating parallel to each other, separated by just a few feet, they made conversation. A referee broke in. They kept talking. Finally, when they reached their benches, and the yelling reached a crescendo, Jovanovski pointed to the scoreboard. The Panthers were leading, 2-0, then.<ep>
  End of conversation.<ep>
  ``It's playoff hockey,'' Lindros said. ``There's going to be a lot of talking, a lot of emotion. That's just the way it is.''<ep>
  Jovanovski, of course, got the last word Wednesday. He was beaten on the corner for the Flyers' game-tying goal with 1:07 left in regulation. But just four minutes into overtime, Jovanovski's shot was tipped by Dave Lowry for the game-winner. Jovanovski was ebullient in the celebration, his arms flailing, his face red. Lindros walked into the tunnel with his head bowed.<ep>
  ``I goofed up on the tying goal,'' Jovanovski said. ``I took that to heart. I didn't want to let the team down.''<ql>
