<m0>   <m0>The Big, Ugly People liken the Panthers to New Jersey, the team the Godzillas least enjoy playing. Florida likens Philadelphia to themselves, a four-line team that stresses defense. The season series was dead even. The Orange Floats lost two in OT to Tampa Bay, but will win two in Miami to get to the conference finals. <m0>THE BIG UGLY PEOPLE IN FIVE.<m0><ep>

<m0>   <m0>The Pens smote the Manhattans, 8-2, late in the season without Mario the Magnificent. That was before Mark the Messier led the reconstructed Blueboys in getting their act together against Montreal. Strong forechecking and Alexei Kovalev with the turnovers instead of Kelly Miller will rid us of Pittsburgh's AHL defense. Of course, that still leaves us the <m0>RANGERS . . . IN SIX.<m0><ql>

<m0>   <m0>By winning the Senior Shootout, the Blues get the opportunity to add a few more games to their already overextended careers. Neither team looked sharp last round, but Detroit has enough talent to get away with it. If the Wings don't regain their edge this round, look for them to fall a round short of last year's run. As for this round, take the <m0>RED WINGS IN FIVE<m0>.<ql>

<m0>   Best Duel Between Good, Bad and Uglies: Claude Lemieux vs. Chris Chelios. The Hawks romped against Calgary, which wanted to Left Wing Lock the Blackhawks in the neutral zone. What they don't have is the size to unsettle the Avalanche, who have both Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg playing well. It hasn't stopped snowing around the Great Lakes. A bad sign for Chicago, good for the <m0>SNOWMEN IN SIX<m0>.<ep>
