   Just put it on net, pal. That's all you do in playoff sudden death overtime. In regulation, too for that matter. Just send it at the net and let things happen.<P>

  Twice, Panthers defensemen followed that piece of wisdom in Thursday's 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers that tied the Eastern Conference semifinal series, 2-2.<P>

   The first time, Paul Laus led to the Panthers taking a 3-2 lead after two periods. The second time, Ed Jovanovski sent a shot toward another piece of Panthers playoff history.<P>

   Philadelphia had stunned the Panthers and Miami Arena crowd by tying the score with 1:07 left in regulation.<P>

  The rookie defenseman, who battled brilliantly with Philadelphia superman Eric Lindros all game, gathered in a clear up the middle then wristed it toward the Flyers goal. Left wing Dave Lowry, now the Panthers' top postseason goal scorer, deflected it into a net that was being raised off the back by teammate Scott Mellanby.<P>

  One video replay later, and, voila, the Panthers had won their first overtime playoff game in team history. This team that hasn't won a regular season overtime game since Dec. 2, 1993 took only 4:06 to win one in the playoffs.<P>

  Back to Philadelphia this series goes, just as tied as it was when it opened there a week ago. Game 5 is Sunday afternoon.<P>

  ``We can ride this for a couple of days, but we have to be ready for the next one,'' Lowry said.<P>

   The replay showed that the puck crossed the line as Mellanby had blundered into the back of the goal while battling behind the net with the Philadelphia defense. But what officials were looking for was whether the shot had been intentionally redirected in off a Lowry skate, which would have nullified the goal. Lowry clearly caught the shot with his stick.<P>

  Two of the Panthers' regular season losses to Philadelphia came in overtime at Miami Arena. Philadelphia beat the Panthers during the 1995 season when Lindros scored in overtime and beat the Panthers Nov. 30 on Kevin Haller's goal with 29.5 secondds left in overtime.<P>

  The Flyers had a chance to do it again, 3:20 into the extra period when Dale Hawerchuk was given the liberty to walk through the left faceoff circle, fire on the Florida goal and take a poke at the loose rebound between John Vanbiesbrouck's skates. Vanbiesbrouck went down, but kept it out and as bodies flew into the crease, the puck flew out to safety.<P>

<P>

  Panthers Coach Doug MacLean split up Niedermayer and Mellanby, putting Niedermayer with Radek Dvorak and Martin Straka.<P>

  ``Scott's kind of an up and down, physical guy,'' Niedermayer said. ``Those two guys are more finesse and speed.''<P>

  Niedermayer is about speed, as Philadelphia's Eric Desjardins found out when Niedermayer blocked a dump-in at center ice. One second, Niedermayer was in Desjardins' face, the next, he was behind Desjardins and cutting toward the net. Philadelphia goalie Ron Hextall came out, but opened his five-hole as he did, and Niedermayer took the invitation 1:02 into the game.<P>

  Niedermayer made it 2-0 during a five-on-three when he curled into the right circle and beat Hextall to the short side.<P>

  The Panthers escaped the period up, 2-0, though the Flyers had already stepped up their attack. The Flyers' Shjon Podein stripped Jason Woolley for a one-on-one with Vanbiesbrouck, then missed wide right with a wrister. Philadelphia's Petr Svoboda saw a point drive deflected off the right post. Vanbiesbrouck had to clear the puck himself after Pat Falloon moseyed down the slot, splitting the defense before losing control for a second.<P>

  Mikael Renberg (slot, wrister, caught and smothered), Joel Otto (faceoff circle, wrister, stack pads) and Desjardins (thrice from the point on a power play) all tested Vanbiesbrouck with the stated results in the first half of the second period. Podein was absolutely robbed at the right post when Trent Klatt circled the defense, drew every to him, then fed an unmarked Podein.<P>

  It appeared Florida would escape the second period with a secure two-goal bulge -- despite being on their way to being outshot 24-11 in the stanza -- when they got undisciplined in the last four minutes.<P>

  Panthers defenseman Paul Laus ignored a loose puck outside the Florida blue line to lay some body in front of the Flyers' bench. Renberg wasn't nearly so disdainful of found rubber, dropped to Eric Lindros, then got it back when Lindros was pokechecked by Rhett Warrener. Renberg quickly stepped around Warrener in the faceoff circle, then neatly lifted a shot past Vanbiesbrouck on the short side.<P>

  That was at 16:18 of the period. A mere 30 seconds later, the Flyers were on the power play after Mellanby got his stick up around the neck and face of Dan Quinn. Quinn worked a give-and-go with Rod Brind'Amour perfectly, setting up Brind'Amour's payoff one-timer at 17:36 of the second.<P>

  As the game seemed to be a replay of Game 5 in the first round, when Boston came from 2-0 down to tie in the second period, the Panthers did their part for deja vu: scored late in the period, this time with 5.5 seconds left.<P>

  Strong forechecking by Stu Barnes and Dave Lowry kept the puck in the Philadelphia end and when Laus collected a hardaround at the right point, Barnes headed for the net. Laus' lofty shot was deflected down through the five-hole of Hextall, who was conservatively eight miles out of his crease.<P>

<P>

   Philadelphia defenseman Kerry Huffman, picked up from Ottawa at the trade deadline, made the biggest defensive play of the night with 2:24 left in regulation. A clear skipped past him at the blueline, and center Rob Niedermayer took off after it.<P>

  This race should have been no contest with Niedermayer racing away toward a possible hat trick and game-clinching goal. But Huffman began hooking him repeatedly while keeping his feet moving so he wasn't Saskatoon water skiing, which would have commanded referee Rob Shick slap him with a hooking call.<P>

  Instead, Niedermayer was off balance when he finally escaped Huffman's stick in the circle and managed merely a desperate shot while falling. Hextall stopped it just before Niedermayer steamrolled him and Huffman cleared the rebound from an empty cage.<P>

  Now, the last thing you want to do is give up the zone too easily and the Panthers were retreating as the Flyers crossed the line as the clock ticked toward the final minute. Soon, everybody lost their defensive assignments, so Mikael Renberg was free to get the necessary two whacks needed to tie the score with 1:07 left in regulation.
