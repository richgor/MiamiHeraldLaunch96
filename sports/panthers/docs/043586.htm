  PHILADELPHIA -- The leader of the Florida Panthers looked so loose Friday, leaning against a wall outside the locker room, laughing and talking team. But when a different string of questions came at Panthers Coach Doug MacLean, his smiling stopped, and he stood up straight, uncrossing his arms. Droplets of sweat started forming above his lip, and he fidgeted with his glasses and he admitted later that, yes, this was a terribly uncomfortable subject.<P>

   MacLean, you see, doesn't like discussing how great he is.<P>

   Reporters asked him about being named a finalist for Coach Of The Year, and MacLean deflected the praise as deftly as his goalie does pucks. He credited the owner, the general manager, his assistants, the players -- ``an organizational award,'' he called it -- and, soon enough, the cluster around him dissolved to nothing. Reporters walked away, one by one, in search of something that sounded more interesting.<P>

   At one point, MacLean actually sounded like he was apologizing, asking, ``Do I sound as boring as I did last night?''<P>

  This doesn't happen to our other winners, Pat Riley and Jimmy Johnson. They get paid $45,000 to speak, so they  decide when they are done giving wisdom-filled answers and, if you want more, you can buy their books. MacLean? The last speech he made was for free, to a group of Coral Park second-graders.<P>

  ``There's not a big demand,'' he joked. ``Which is too bad because I'm a hell of a speaker. Spoke at a high-school graduation once. The kids loved me. But maybe that's because the speech was nine minutes.''<P>

   Nice-guy MacLean comes across serious in television interviews and press conferences, which are his most visible link to the public, but he has a quick sense of humor that is especially sharp when he's making fun of himself. A reporter asked him Friday about Florida's boring style in upsetting Philadelphia, and MacLean responded, ``Everybody I talked to thought it was exciting. Of course, I only talked to close family members. I talked to one guy who thought it was the most exciting thing he's ever seen. I said, `Really, Dad?' ''<P>

  The lovable Panthers have taken on the personality of their coach, always putting the team first in an increasingly me-me-me sports world. This is MacLean's doing, but when the subject turns back to his coaching, he stares down, kicking at the ground.<P>

  ``I don't know what to say,'' he says when asked if, maybe, just maybe, he is a finalist for Coach Of The Year because he is a pretty good coach. ``I really don't. I'm having trouble with these questions. I worked hard, but there's been a lot of help here. And I haven't worked any harder than the other 25 coaches in this league.''<P>

  But aren't you proud of yourself, Doug?<P>

  ``I've never thought of it that way,'' he says. ``I look at it more like survival. I'm proud I've survived. Bryan Murray deserves the credit. He stuck his neck out by hiring me.''<P>

  That's how it is with MacLean. He isn't content to merely share credit; he gives it away. Never mind that his team has no business having come as far as it has. Never mind that it has a 1-0 lead over favored Philadelphia -- and, in fact, is the only team in the league that hasn't lost in this building this year -- because it plays the game's most disciplined hockey, overcoming a lack of talent by latching on to others' mistakes like leeches do to blood.<P>

  ``I don't want to toot my own horn,'' MacLean said. ``I know the contributions everyone else is making here. I don't think I'm being humble. I'm being realistic. There are lots of coaches who have been unbelievably successful -- and I'm not one of them yet -- and you don't hear about them very much, either.''<P>

  Like whom?<P>

  ``The Chicago Bulls coach, for example.''<P>

  Yeah, but Phil Jackson has Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. You have Dave Lowry, Bill Lindsay and Paul Laus.<P>

  ``I don't believe it's me,'' MacLean said. ``Here, it's not one guy.''<P>

  MacLean spent nine years as an assistant coach and seven years teaching at a high school. He has been fired a few times. His isn't false modesty. When the Panthers offered him the job, he accepted without even asking how much he would be making.<P>

  ``Don't think we don't notice the way he always puts the team first,'' Panther Stu Barnes says. ``He preaches that philosophy, and he lives it. He doesn't want to accept praise, but he'll take the blame. That rubs off on all of us.''<P>

   You think MacLean is boring?<P>

   He's only as boring as his team.<P>

   Only as boring as winning.
