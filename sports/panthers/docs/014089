<m0>   PHILADELPHIA (--) Panthers right wing <m0>Ray Sheppard <m0>denied his absence from Wednesday's practice and Thursday's morning skate had anything to do with a rapid heartbeat. Sheppard said he just felt dehydrated from the flu.<ep>
  ``I feel fine now, 100 percent,'' Sheppard said jovially. ``I can't complain. Life is good.''<ep>
  Sheppard, <m0>Tom Fitzgerald <m0>and <m0>Johan Gar<m4>Sheppard<m2><ql>
<m0>penlov <m0>sat out an optional skate Friday.<ep>
  ``I said to them, `You know your bodies better than I do,' '' Panthers Coach <m0>Doug MacLean <m0>said.<ql>
<m1>Even if the shoe doesn't fit<ep>
<m0>   Once a team gets a label around the league, it's harder to shake than a Sutter in a corner. The City of Philadelphia spent Friday moaning about the neutral-zone trap, which the Panthers are accused of playing whether they win games 6-2 or 2-0.<ep>
  ``We didn't play the trap once that I saw,'' MacLean said. ``If we played it, I didn't notice it.''<ql>
<m1>Family ties<ep>
<m0>   When Flyers center <m0>Eric Lindros <m0>talked with his brother <m0>Brett <m0>on Wednesday, this series was one thing they didn't discuss. Brett, the No. 9 overall pick in the 1994 draft, was forced to retire this week after suffering 10 concussions over four seasons.<ep>
  ``That would be bruising his heart,'' Eric said of talking about the playoffs. ``I think he wants to stay away from the game for a while.''<ql>
<m1>Line dancing<ep>
<m0>   Flyers Coach <m0>Terry Murray <m0>saw late in the second period Thursday that Lindros, <m0>John LeClair <m0>and <m0>Dale Hawerchuk <m0>were going nowhere fast. So he moved <m0>Mikael Renberg <m0>back to the top line in an unsuccessful attempt to juice up the offense.<ep>
   It didn't work. The reunited Legion of Doom had zero shots in the third period.<ep>
   Hawerchuk was back with Lindros and LeClair in practice Friday. Renberg, still nursing a sore pelvic tendon, skipped practice. Murray said Hawerchuk likely will start Saturday night's game with Lindros and LeClair.<ep>
