   Philadelphia's Paul Bunyan, center Eric Lindros, proved in the Flyers' first-round series he had learned his lesson concerning retribution in playoff hockey. Now, with the way Lindros Cuisinarted his way through Game 2 against the Panthers, he's testing whether Florida has learned the same lesson.<ep>
   ``Eric learned it's more important to win than to get even,'' Flyers General Manager Bob Clarke said before this series, which reaches Game 3 tonight.<ep>
   The Panthers say they agree. Whether they can act in such a manner will become apparent over the next three days as, just like half the stars of <m0>America's Most Wanted<m0>, Lindros comes through South Florida.<ep>
   ``I can't say what's going to happen when the emotions get going, but one thing that has gotten us to the position we're in now is discipline,'' Panthers goalie John Vanbiesbrouck said.<ep>
   ``In the Tampa Bay series, they continually went after him and it cost them the series,'' Panthers Coach Doug MacLean said. ``Philadelphia kept getting power plays, the game got out of hand, then it's 5-1 and what happens? Lindros kicks the crap out of a guy.''<ep>
   Tampa Bay's Igor Ulanov and Michel Petit delivered some legal and illegal physical harassment to Lindros and the big center responded with better hits in Game 5. In Game 6, Lindros gave Ulanov his comeuppance by battering him in a fight after the Flyers had run away with the clinching game.<ep>
   Of course, should tonight's game be the back-and-forth game the rest of this series has been, you won't see Lindros flinging fists with Panthers defenseman Ed Jovanovski because both will sit for five minutes.<ep>
   ``That would definitely be a great exchange [for the Panthers],'' Jovanovski said. ``He's a good enough player to know that.''<ep>
   And, though Jovanovski is an emotional rookie, he's plenty smart enough to know when to go and when to pass on punching. Lindros, Baby Huey with an attitude, rose from a Jovanovski bulldozing Saturday night to get chest to chest with Jovanovski while challenging, ``Hit me, hit me.''<ep>
   ``It's all part of the game,'' Jovanovski said. ``He was trying to get a penalty on me. At that point, it would've given them a key power play.''<ep>
   That was one of the more benign pieces of gamesmanship by Lindros, who also tried to loom intimidatingly in the face of a bemused-looking Rhett Warrener after the rookie took him to the ice along the boards. Admiration came from both locker rooms for the way Lindros got the Game 2 winner and assisted on the Flyers other two goals.<ep>
   ``If that's what we need to win hockey games, I'll be happy to do it,'' Lindros told reporters in Philadelphia. ``For us to be successful, we have to be physical. We have to play that in-your-face hockey.''<ep>
   What got the Panthers peeved, got MacLean upbraiding referee Mark Faucette in a Spectrum tunnel and got the league watching some of the stick violations closely in Sunday's Game 2 of the Rangers-Penguins series was Lindros' sidework that went from careless to cheap.<ep>
   Three high sticks, a two-hander to Jovanovski's knee, a sneak elbow to Jovanovski's face, using his stick to demask Vanbiesbrouck, taking a run at Robert Svehla after the whistle . . . Lindros had a busier Saturday night than a nightclub DJ.<ep>
   ``Personally, I'm not frustrated, but I didn't get any stitches either,'' Vanbiesbrouck said. ``I know a couple of our guys needed two days to get over the frustration of taking sticks that weren't called. It was like a M*A*S*H unit (--) `Where's Hawkeye?' ''<ep>
   MacLean and Panthers GM Bryan Murray wasted only the time it took to berate Faucette in getting a postgame audience with supervisor of officials John D'Amico.<ep>
   ``On incidents involving the stick, whether intentional or careless, a penalty has to be called or suspension made,'' said Murray, who also talked to NHL discipline czar Brian Burke about Lindros' behavior in Saturday's game.<ep>
   A more pointed problem for the Panthers than Lindros using his stick to go upside Florida heads is him using his stick to pile up points. A zero-shot effort in Game 1 was followed by a three-point Game 2.<ep>
   ``We gave him more room than we should've,'' Panthers defenseman Paul Laus said. ``The first game, we skated in front of him, pretty much smothered him. He got a head of steam last game.''<ql>
