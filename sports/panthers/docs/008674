   Those players conspicuous by their absence from Game 4 should be back in the lineup for Game 5.<ep>
   (box) Panthers defenseman <m0>Robert Svehla, <m0>shield on helmet, will be back with his broken nose and bereft of a few teeth after he got an unintentional <m0>Eric Lindros <m0>skate to the face in the first period.<ep>
   (box) Panthers right wing <m0>Ray Sheppard <m0>worked out on the exercise bike Friday after missing Game 4 with a bruised right shoulder.<ep>
   Panthers Coach <m0>Doug MacLean, <m0>figuring the Panthers had a good shot at winning the game sans Sheppard, decided (--) against Sheppard's wishes (--) to scratch him and give him a five-day rest.<ep>
   (box) Panthers defenseman <m0>Gord Murphy <m0>wasn't bothered by his foot Thursday night, but the Panthers coaching staff was bothered more by the situation: a defenseman who hadn't played in three weeks stepping into the rhythms of the playoffs.<ep>
   ``It was too critical a game to play somebody back into shape,'' MacLean said.<ep>
    (box) The IV Philadelphia winger <m0>John LeClair <m0>took before the game and after the warm-ups didn't help his stomach flu, which is why he left after a few shifts. With today off, LeClair is expected to be ready Sunday.<ql>
<m0>Jovanovski vs. Lindros<ep>
<m0>   For the first time, MacLean played down the burgeoning rivalry between Lindros and Panthers defenseman <m0>Ed Jovanovski, <m0>which seems to add a new chapter each game of this series. Each blasted the other to the ice Thursday, and they also exchanged sentiments several times with Jovanovski pointing at the scoreboard after one debate.<ep>
   ``We don't like to put that kind of pressure on him,'' MacLean said. ``That's why we've only spotted him against Eric. We're talking about a superstar there.''<ep>
   MacLean, however, did concede, ``I think it'll be an exciting match to watch over the next 10 years.''<ql>
<m0>Swift sellout<ep>
<m0>   The official word on Game 6 is that it sold out in four minutes Friday morning.<ep>
