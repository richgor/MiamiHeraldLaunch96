   Panthers center Stu Barnes, waiting for a post-practice ride from left wing Dave Lowry, jokingly compared him to Colorado point factory Joe Sakic. Later, more seriously, so did Panthers General Manager Bryan Murray.<ep>
   Now, anybody who has seen Lowry and Sakic play might hear of such comparisons and think the Panthers were having some fun at their Pompano practice facility that wouldn't be approved by the DEA. But there's a perfectly plausible explanation.<ep>
   What's happening with Lowry is an annual phenomenon in the NHL playoffs.<ep>
   A forward steps out of character and puts up numbers incongruous with his regular season. The performance often lasts only the spring, then he returns to his former state. When the playoffs begin 10 months later, the cycle is repeated by another.<ep>
   Lowry had 10 goals in 63 regular-season games, only four since January. Thursday night's overtime deflection that tied the Eastern Conference semifinal with Philadelphia made Lowry the Panthers' leading playoff goal scorer with six in nine games.<ep>

<m0>   ``What happens is the top goal scorers gets so much attention from checkers, it leaves a lot of room,'' Murray said. ``Also, Dave's confident.''<ep>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<m0>   Lowry agreed confidence was a factor, saying, ``When you don't score, you hold the stick tighter. I hadn't scored the last 12 games of the regular season.''<ep>
   It's always that way for somebody.<ep>
   Last year, it was New Jersey's Claude Lemieux, who stepped up with 13 goals in 20 games after 24 in the previous 124 regular-season games. The Rangers' talented and exasperating Alexei Kovalev had 21 points in 23 playoff games on the way to the 1994 Stanley Cup.<ep>
   Paul DiPietro's eight goals and five assists in 17 playoff games for Montreal in 1993 after eight goals, 19 assists in 62 regular-season games actually changed Panthers history. When the expansion draft came up two weeks after the 1993 playoffs, DiPietro's postseason performance prompted Montreal to protect him and leave Jesse Belanger out to be taken by the Panthers.<ep>
   Immediately after Lowry was taken in that expansion draft, the former checking line left wing was installed on what was the Panthers' first line with Scott Mellanby and Rob Niedermayer. He bounced among the Panthers' <m1> <m0>first two lines during the first two seasons and his name was tossed about in trade rumors.<ep>
   ``There were a couple of inquiries, `Are you doing anything with anybody? What about Dave Lowry?' but there's never been any intention other than keeping him here,'' Murray said. ``He's a big, strong guy, decent skater. We didn't have a lot of his type of player, so there was no reason to talk to another team.''<ep>
   A ligament sprain in October cost Lowry his spot with Barnes early in the season. They were reunited in the last week of the regular season with right wing Ray Sheppard, a grouping Panthers Coach Doug MacLean claims he made only because injuries and personnel left him no other choice. Sheppard, Barnes and Lowry are Nos. 1, 2 and 4 among Panthers' playoff scorers.<ep>
   Lowry said, ``I've got some bounces. Playing with Stu Barnes, who has elevated his play, and Ray Sheppard, a natural goal scorer, I just try to go to the net.''<ep>
   Of Lowry's goals, Thursday's overtime winner gets the distance blue ribbon, about 30 feet. That's the combined length of his other five payoff shots, once again underlining why scoring in <m1> <m0>the playoffs is like collecting garbage: It's an ugly task done in tough areas.<ep>
   It's something Lowry has long known, and was crystalized this season by his pal Scott Mellanby.<ep>
   ``I watched how he battles to get goals,'' Lowry said. ``He pays the price night after night to get open in front.''<ep>
