  PHILADELPHIA -- The Panthers did all they could to get and keep home-ice advantage in the first round. In Philadelphia, there are some who wish they had it for the second round, too, because there's one thing the Panthers never do in Philadelphia: lose.<P>

  It's a six-game unbeaten streak (3-0-3) the Panthers carry into The Spectrum for tonight's Game 2, a remarkable run considering the fearsome Spectrum crowd and its roar-riding team that has won two division titles while getting consistently nicked in its own house by the Panthers.<P>

   How is it that no other NHL team can consistently tame The Beasts of the Spectrum -- neither the ones in the stands nor the ones wearing the winged P on the ice -- except the Panthers?<P>

   ``Maybe because we have so many former Flyers?'' Panthers left wing Mike Hough initially guessed with a laugh toward Terry Carkner, Gord Murphy and Scott Mellanby, all of whom fit that description.<P>

  Don't ask the Flyers themselves. All they can do after each game, especially the Florida victories, is moan about a lack of intensity on their part. It was the same after Thursday night's 2-0 defensive seminar by Florida, the second shutout in the streak.<P>

  ``We didn't play with our normal intensity, and I don't know the explanation,'' Flyers forward Dale Hawerchuk said.<P>

  ``I don't know if I can explain why there was a lack of intensity at this point in the season,'' Flyers Coach Terry Murray said.<P>

  See? And, if it's not that, then it's the non sequitur whining:<P>

  <LI> The Panthers were held to a 3-3 tie in April 1994 when Flyers goalie Tommy Soderstrom stopped a breakaway and three other would-be game-winners during last 11 minutes. Afterward, Flyers center Rod Brind'Amour snapped the Panthers were probably satisfied because they played for a tie.<P>

  <LI> After the Panthers racehorsed through most of November's 2-1 victory and had outshot Philly, 18-4, during the first 25 minutes, Eric Lindros said Florida ``really had their trap working.''<P>

  Actually, it's not the evil trap, but an overall conservative approach that does the Panthers right.<P>

  ``You know you can't do anything special,'' Panthers center Tom Fitzgerald said. ``Play solid defense. Get the puck out of your zone. Make sure there are no turnovers in the neutral zone. Get the puck in deep and smart deep -- so [Philly goalie Ron] Hextall can't play it because he can catch you off-guard.''<P>

  ``We play fearful of the team we're playing,'' Mellanby said. ``We play really simple hockey. It's tough to score goals against us.''<P>

  Twice, the Panthers have blanked the Flyers, twice they've allowed only one goal. All six times, the Panthers have scored first, which helps erase the energizing crowd.<P>

  ``Because of the history here, the crowd is really vocal,'' Hough said. ``They're really behind their team and gets the team into it. We knew they would come out strong the first 10 minutes. We saw what happened to Tampa Bay, so we were cautious the first 10 minutes, then took our opportunities.''<P>

   No Flyers goals, few big Flyers hits . . . suddenly, the most obstreperous U.S. hockey crowd turns into grumbling individuals who resemble fenced-in Dobermans throwing frustrated single barks at a passing pedestrian. The Flyers pick up on their fans' edginess and begin to get a little aggravated themselves, as was noticed Thursday night.<P>

  ``When you pick a guy off in the corner, the play goes to the other side, then you suddenly feel a cross-check in the back, he's frustrated,'' Fitzgerald said. ``Lindros did that to a few guys last night. If he wants to do that, fine. It just plays into our hands.''<P>

  Fans leaving Thursday night grumbled they had seen this out of New Jersey last season and spent Friday griping about how dull the Panthers were. Obviously, they just didn't get it.<P>

  ``We've taken it as a compliment for three years,'' Hough said.
