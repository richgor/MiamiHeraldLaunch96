   On Friday, police say, Nahin Roberto Palma was the 16-year-old tough guy with a gun who shot two other teens at Miami High.<P>

   On Saturday, Palma was his mother's son. She turned him in to police.<P>

   ``The mother did the right thing,'' said Miami homicide detective <BR>
Confesor Gonzalez, who charged Palma with two counts of attempted first-degree murder. ``She did what she felt was in the best interest of her child.''<P>

   Police were seeking Palma after witnesses identified him as the gunman whose bullets struck student Belmy Monterrey, 15, and Alex Esquivel, 16, a former student. None of the wounds were life-threatening.<P>

   The lunchtime shootings occurred immediately outside, and then inside, historic Miami High School after a fight between rival gang members escalated beyond fisticuffs, police said. Monterrey apparently was not an intended target.<P>

   Palma's mother tipped police that her son was at an apartment complex near Southwest Fourth Avenue and Third Street. Gang Unit detective Aquiles Carmona found Palma hanging out with some friends there and arrested him about 12:45 p.m.<P>

   Palma, of 2117 SW Fifth St., ``has been associated with a gang and has been involved in gang activity,'' Gonzalez said. ``He gave a statement admitting to us that he was there and was involved in the incident.''<P>

   Police found a handgun at Palma's house Friday, Gonzalez said. Ballistics tests are not complete, but the gun type ``was consistent'' with several small-caliber casings found on the shooting scene, he said.<P>

   Gonzalez wouldn't say if Esquivel is in a gang, or was the person the gunman was aiming for.<P>

   ``We haven't even determined he was the intended target,'' he said. ``The hallways were crowded. We're still looking for other people.''<P>
