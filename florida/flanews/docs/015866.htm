   LAKE WALES -- The night before the slaughter, seven Indiana nursing students prepared for the inevitable.<P>

   Squirming in their seats, they tried to think of ways they could duck out of beheading squawking, wildly flapping fowl. Their efforts were in vain.<P>

   The slaughter was the culmination of their two-week experience at the HEART Missionary Training Institute, a simulated Third World village six miles south of Lake Wales off U.S. 27.<BR>
<P>

   Prospective missionaries learn to drill wells and pump water; purify water and make irrigation systems; make buildings of wood and concrete; make rope, sharpen knives and work on small engines; cook on an outdoor primitive stove or over an open fire; immunize animals; trim sheep hooves and chicken beaks; slaughter and cook small animals; and establish a health clinic.<P>

   Since the institute started, 422 people preparing for missionary work from 24 countries and numerous religious denominations have trained at HEART. Alumni have served in 51 mission and development agencies in 53 countries beyond the United States and Canada, such as Haiti, Uganda and Kenya.<P>

   Two 15-week sessions are held in the fall and spring for college students. Prices vary from $25 for two days and one night to $2,875 for the 15-week semester. The public can tour the institute free every Tuesday at 10 a.m.<BR>
The nursing students from Anderson University spent two weeks living without electricity, cooking over a camp fire, using an outside bathroom that consisted of a hole in the ground and showering by flashlight, using a fire to heat the water.<P>

   The biggest challenge proved to be slaughtering a duck.<P>

   ``This is the toughest part for students,'' said Joseph Mattox, executive director of HEART.<P>

   Student Carol Marker, 22, said it wasn't the blood, but the act of killing that bothered her: ``It's not what we went to school to do. We're supposed to save people.''<P>

   The lone male student among them was less worried.<P>

   ``It's just a duck,'' said Jeff Worst, 41. ``Everything is a frame of mind.''<P>

   In a Third World country, one duck would feed a family of seven for a week, say teachers at HEART, or Hunger, Education and Resources Training.<P>

   The institute, started in 1984 by Warner Southern College in Lake Wales and Food for the Hungry International, teaches problem-solving and coping skills that students can take with them as missionaries.   Mattox said Warner Southern started the program after two professors at the college, Charlie Smith and Robert Clark, both of Lake Wales, wanted a place to provide practical missionary experience.<P>

   ``They experience a bit of a cultural shock getting rid of the conveniences they had, but they learn to adjust and survive in a new environment,'' said Mattox, who spent 10 years in missionary settings in Latin America.<P>

   HEART used to receive about $20,000 of its $165,000 budget from Warner Southern, Mattox said. But cutbacks forced HEART to become a nonprofit organization separate from Warner Southern in January 1995. Although still associated with the college, it now relies on tuition and donations to operate.<P>

   HEART, modeled after Peace Corps training camps, is on a 40-acre site owned by Warner Southern. After a mile of dirt road, the village begins with a field for goats, sheep and ducks.<P>

   Next to the field is a garden where students learn how to grow food, such as banana trees, papaya, eggplant, cabbage and carrots.<P>

   Two windmills pump water underground to the village. Surrounded by hundreds of trees, the village has six two-story cabins, three outhouses, two outside showers, a classroom and a mess hall. The cabins are named ``peace'' in various languages.<BR>
   The program is structured with chores, practical instruction and classroom learning. Days begin at 7 a.m. and end at 5:30 p.m. A cow bell alerts participants to breakfast, lunch and dinner.<P>

   Among HEART's goals is reducing the high turnover rate among missionaries. Mattox said that 50 percent of those who go overseas return before their assignment is finished or never take a second assignment because it was not what they expected.<P>

   Mattox said some people decide they don't want to go into missionary work after leaving.<P>

   ``A few decide they are not cut out for it. But it is better for them to find out here than overseas,'' Mattox said. ``It takes a special type of person and calling to do missionary-type work.''<P>

   By the end of their two-week stay, the Anderson nursing students were looking forward to staying in Orlando before going back to Indiana.<P>

   ``It's been an eye-opening experience,'' said student Chris Hensel, 22. ``It gives you a little touch of reality.''<P>
