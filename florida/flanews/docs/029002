   WASHINGTON (--) The Supreme Court Monday rejected a challenge to a Florida county's ban on nude dancing, turning away arguments that the ordinance violates erotic dancers' freedom of artistic expression.<ep>
   Lawyers for the owners of Cafe Erotica had argued that St. Johns County forced dancers into bikinis, ``and the message inherent in their erotic performances has been significantly diluted, if not effectively stifled.''<ep>
   Monday's action was taken without comment. A federal trial judge and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had previously thrown out the challenge to the 1992 ordinance.<ep>
   The justices ruled in 1991 that states and local governments may ban all barroom-style nude dancing and force its practitioners to wear G-strings and pasties.<ep>
   But that decision was reached by a 5-4 vote and did not yield any one opinion that spoke for a court majority.<ep>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the court's main opinion in 1991, in which he said, ``The requirement that the dancers wear pasties and a G-string does not deprive the dance of whatever erotic message it conveys; it simply makes the message slightly less graphic.''<ep>
   The St. Johns County Commission, sitting in St. Augustine, enacted the disputed ordinance a few months after Cafe Erotica, a restaurant that does not serve alcoholic beverages, began featuring nude dancing in 1992.<ep>
   The ordinance requires more clothing than pasties and a G-string. About one-third of a dancer's buttocks must be covered, and about one-fourth of female breasts.<ep>
   In the appeal acted upon Monday, lawyers for Cafe Erotica contended that the fractured 1991 ruling left lower courts ``utterly without guidance'' in dealing with disputes over governmental attempts to impose minimum-clothing requirements on erotic dancers.<ep>
   The appeal added:<ep>
   ``Regardless of whether this court deems this issue to be the most important constitutional issue of the day, the plain fact is it is an issue which is recurring with great frequency, and which, absent some guidance from this court, surely will monopolize an undue amount of the time of the federal court system.''<ql>
