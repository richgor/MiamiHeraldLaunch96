  After nearly three weeks of trying, a jury has been selected in Palm Beach County for the murder trial of John Zile. Opening arguments begin Monday.<ep>
  Zile is charged with beating to death his 7-year-old stepdaughter Christina Holt in Sept. 1994. Christina's mother Pauline Zile was convicted of murder last year and is serving a life sentence. Prosecutors say they'll seek the death penalty against John Zile if he is convicted.<ep>
  Eight men and four women will hear the case, along with three alternate jurors. Attorneys rejected more than 100 prospective jurors because they said they knew about the case, and they had made up their minds that John Zile was guilty.<ql>
