<m0>he Amazon region was densely populated when the first Europeans arrived in South America, yet fish, game and forests remained plentiful. A <m0>University of Florida <m0>geographer argues that powerful supernatural beliefs prevented indigenous people from depleting their area's natural resources.<ep>
  It was nothing close to Henry David Thoreau's notions about the virtues of living in harmony with the land, Nigel Smith said. Rather, profound fear of supernatural spirits kept greed in check. ``They believed there are spirit beings out there who will punish people who go overboard when they hunt and fish.''<ep>
  In two decades of research projects such as charting communities in the Amazon's flood plain and collecting genetic data on plants, Smith also collected folklore from peasants. His book, <m0>The Enchanted Amazon Rain Forest: Stories from a Vanishing World, <m0>has just been published by the University Press of Florida.<ep>
  He heard stories about spirit protectors of two dozen species of fish important in diets and commerce. He collected gruesome tales about what the ``Father of Game'' did to hunters who killed too many animals per hunting trip. Other stories of supernatural nature protectors include the ``Mother of Rubber Trees,'' who stole the shadows of rubber gatherers when they gashed rubber trees too much while gathering sap.<ql>

<m0>   Growing cynicism about government is a clear sign of the Americanization of <m1> <m0>Cuban Americans, <m0>Florida International University <m0>political scientists report.<ep>
  Older Cuban immigrants showed an extraordinary trust of American government, professors <m1> <m0>Dario Moreno and Kevin Hill found in a study to be published next month in the Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences. More than a third of those who were 10 or older when they immigrated report they ``always trust the government.''<ep>
  Only a 10th of U.S.-born Cuban Americans gave that response, indicating that group shares the growing distrust of government Americans in general have reported over the past 20 years, they wrote.<ep>
Nearly 60 percent of older Cuban immigrants believe there is no discrimination against Cubans. Fewer than 25 percent of second-generation Cuban Americans believe that. More than 70 percent of all Cuban Americans identify with the Republican Party. For U.S.-born Cuban Americans, it drops to 48.5 percent.<m1><ql>

<m0>  Despite conventional wisdom, states with the most military bases and defense contracts did not have a significant economic advantage over other states during the military build-up of the 1980s, a <m0>Florida State University <m0>researcher has found.<ep>
  If a state already had high military employment in 1980, getting more military jobs did not make it economically stronger than other states, John Grimes, geography doctoral student, reported to the Association of American Geographers last month.<ep>
  A military base has a big payroll, but most of the private-sector jobs it stimulates are low-wage service employment, such as bars and stores catering to military personnel and providing some supplies to bases.<ep>
  States that missed out on the military boom made up for it with economic development that brought a broader range of higher-paying jobs, Grimes said.<ql>
