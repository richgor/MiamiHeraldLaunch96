   TALLAHASSEE -- Jean Rozmus has seen her monthly water and sewer bill soar 466 percent in the last five years. The retired widow takes sponge baths most days and only flushes her toilet when absolutely necessary.<P>

   Now she and other customers of Southern States Utilities are watching Florida utility regulators to see whether they grant the company an $18 million rate increase.<P>

   Based in Apopka, Southern States is Florida's largest water-sewer utility. It has 152 water and-or sewer systems and serves more than 100,000 customers in 21 counties from the Everglades to Tampa Bay to the Panhandle.<P>

   The Public Service Commission is starting several weeks of hearings on the utility's rate increase request today. <P>

   Diane Kiesling, one of the five regulators on the panel, said the case was the most complex, contentious water and sewer rate case the PSC has ever seen. But the hearings themselves will be dull, she said.<P>

   ``It's going to be periods of brain-numbing boredom interspersed with mind-boggling detail,'' she said.<P>

   But there's more to this case than technical background. Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay earlier this year enraged utility customers when he appeared to intervene on the company's behalf. MacKay has since apologized.<P>

   Jack Shreve, who represents consumers in utility-rate cases before the PSC, said it was sad people's lives were made more difficult because of their utility bills.<P>

   ``There are people out there on fixed incomes that are relying on the state of Florida to keep their bills fair, just and reasonable,'' Shreve said.<P>

   Shreve and several consumer attorneys will try to prove that the PSC should decrease SSU's rates by $10.36 million.<P>

   The utility wants to convince the regulators it needs the $18.1 million rate increase to pay for $100 million in improvements to its water and sewer systems made over the last four years.<P>

   ``We don't like to raise rates, and we know customers don't like to have rates raised,'' said Ida Roberts, a utility spokeswoman. ``However, the company has to stay on a strong financial footing, or we will be unable to continue to provide the quality and environmentally safe services required of us to our customers.''<P>

   Kenneth Berry, a retired mail carrier who lives in Port Richey, blames the utility for tap water so foul-tasting he must buy bottled water.<P>

   ``Since SSU has taken over our area's utility in the last eight years, my water bill has gone up over 300 percent, and the quality of the water has not improved,'' Berry told The St. Petersburg Times in a Sunday story. ``I go through two and three sets of pots and pans every few years because the water is so lousy it ruins them.''<P>

   Rozmus, a Pasco County resident, has seen her monthly water and sewer bill soar from $7.50 to $35. She had to change her habits to try to reduce water consumption in January.<P>

   ``I'm trying to do everything I can to make ends meet,'' she said. ``We're not a wealthy subdivision. We're middle class, mostly retired, so why does SSU's margin of profit have to be so high they take it out on us?''<P>
