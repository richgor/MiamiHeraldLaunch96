   LEESBURG (--) A former Death Row inmate who twice came within hours of being executed has been killed in a car accident.<ep>
   Jerry Chatman, 59, died early Saturday after his car hit a guardrail. He may have suffered a heart attack before the accident, police said.<ep>
   A self-described ``born hustler,'' Chatman was convicted in 1960 of raping of a Fruitland Park woman and was sentenced to death. But two former Lake County deputies later testified that footprints supposedly taken at the scene by other deputies were fabricated.<ep>
   In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court abolished the death penalty across the country and a federal court reversed Chatman's conviction, ruling it was based on tainted evidence.<ep>
   But two years later, an appellate court reinstated the conviction, arguing the deputies' testimony couldn't be believed.<ep>
   A year later, Chatman was sentenced to 40 years in prison. He was released in 1981, after serving 21 years and 13 days. He had maintained his innocence until the end.<ep>
   However, eight years later Chatman was sentenced to five years in prison for selling cocaine.<ep>
