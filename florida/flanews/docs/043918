   ST. AUGUSTINE (--) Monsignor John Patrick Burns, pastor emeritus of St. Matthew's Catholic Church who recruited 75 priests for the Diocese of St. Augustine, has died after a short illness. He was 72.<ep>
   Burns was born in Ireland on St. Patrick's Day in 1922. Ordained to the priesthood in 1950, he served the Diocese of St. Augustine for 46 years.<ep>
   One of Burns' greatest contributions was his recruitment of priests, said Father Ralph Besendorfer, diocesan vicar for clergy. Burns frequently returned to Ireland on recruiting trips.<ep>
   In St. Augustine, he was responsible for building two new elementary schools and supervising the restoration and enlargement of the Cathedral for the city's 400th anniversary in 1965.<ep>
   Previous assignments for Burns were in Gainesville, at St. Joseph's in Jacksonville and at St. Paul's in Jacksonville Beach. He became pastor of St. Matthew's, where he served for 14 years.<ep>
   He lived there until his death.<ep>
   ``His dedication to the education of youth and promotion of vocations to the priesthood was outstanding,'' said Father Luke McLoughlin, pastor of St. Matthew's. ``When it came to building or renovating a church, he always did a beautiful job.''<ep>
   Survivors include two brothers, Diarmuid Joseph and Daniel Finbarr.<ep>
   Vigil and wake services were scheduled for Saturday at St. Matthew's, with a burial Mass Monday at the church. Burial will be in Cork, Ireland.<ep>
