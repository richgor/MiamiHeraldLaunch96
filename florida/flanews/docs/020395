<m0>   <m0>Churba, <m0>Joseph, 62, who was the Air Force's top Middle East intelligence expert in 1976 when he publicly criticized comments by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. George Brown, about Israel's being a military burden for the United States; in New York of a heart attack. Churba was president of the International Security Council, a Washington-based research institute. He was a presidential campaign adviser to Ronald Reagan in 1980 and an adviser to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in 1981 and 1982. On Oct. 19, 1976, Churba told a reporter that Brown's comments had been ``dangerously irresponsible,'' because they encouraged the Arabs and Russians to think U.S. backing for Israel had diminished. He said the comments indicated a growing ``tilt against Israel in the defense department.'' Later Churba's superior, Maj. Gen. George Keegan, told him that because he had talked to the reporter, his special security clearances for signal and satellite intelligence had been suspended and that he was no longer of any value to the Air Force as an intelligence estimator.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>Flanagan, <m0>Dr. John C., 90, a psychologist who devised the aptitude tests that helped select American pilots in World War II and then adapted the technique to education; in Menlo Park, Calif. Flanagan joined the Army Air Forces in 1941 to devise tests that would help identify the men who had the ability to survive the training and become combat pilots. He brought together more than 150 psychologists and 1,400 research assistants for the fledgling Aviation Psychology Program.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>Gaston, <m0>Milt, who had the most Hall of Fame teammates and managers in baseball history; Friday in New York, three months after becoming only the eighth major leaguer to live to 100. Gaston, who pitched in the big leagues from 1924 to 1934, played with Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and 15 other Hall of Famers. He compiled a 97-164 won-loss record with the New York Yankees, St. Louis Browns, Washington Senators, Boston Red Sox and Chicago White Sox. Gaston shares the major league record for allowing the most hits (14) while pitching a shutout and holds the record for taking part in the most double plays by a pitcher (four) in a game.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>Margolis, <m0>George, 81, a Dartmouth College neuropathologist who did some of the early research into Alzheimer's disease; in Ridgefield, Conn. Margolis was on the faculty of Dartmouth Medical School from 1963-82 and helped build the curriculum and research in its department of pathology. He was the author of hundreds of scientific papers. His interest in Alzheimer's disease grew from his work in other areas of investigation. They were primarily the relationship between viruses and brain damage, the effects of changes in atmospheric pressure on the brain and the loss of muscular control due to neurological disorders.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>Sullivan, <m0>Fred G. Jr., 50, an independent filmmaker who used the Adirondacks as his movie lot; in Saranac Lake, N.Y. Sullivan collapsed from heart failure while playing a weekly pickup basketball game at Paul Smith's College, where he was director of development. His <m0>Cold River  <m0>of 1981, filmed outdoors in a bitterly cold winter, told of two children left on their own in the wilderness when their father died. It was the first full-length feature to be shot entirely in the Adirondacks since the silents, except for <m0>Marjorie Morningstar,<m0>  set in a summer resort on Schroon Lake. Sullivan wrote, directed, produced and edited <m0>The Beer Drinker's Guide to Fitness and Film Making,<m0> a 1988 release that acquired something of a cult following. It was an 84-minute home movie, a quirky montage of the Sullivans' life.<ql>
