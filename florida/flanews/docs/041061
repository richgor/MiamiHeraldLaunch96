   ORLANDO (--) Tom Feeney won a special election Saturday to fill the District 33 House seat vacated last month when Republican Marvin Couch resigned amid sex charges.<ep>
   Feeney, a 38-year-old former legislator from Orlando, defeated Democrat Jim Hattaway by 1,241 votes, thanks <m4>Feeney<m2><ql>
<m0>in part to absentee ballots. Feeney took 54.8 percent (--) or 7,105 votes (--) to Hattaway's 45.2 percent, with 5,864 votes.<ep>
   The special election was called after Couch, of Oveido, resigned March 1, just eight days after being arrested in Orlando for soliciting oral sex in public during the middle of the day. Couch, 42, is married and has six children. After his arrest on three misdemeanor charges, he said he had paid prostitutes for sex in the past.<ep>
   Feeney is an outspoken conservative Republican who left the Legislature two years ago to become Jeb Bush's running mate in their unsuccessful bid for the governor's office. He said he was honored that <m1> <m0>voters put him back in office.<ep>
   ``Both sides made this a referendum on Tom Feeney,'' Feeney told The Orlando Sentinel. ``I knew if I got out and met people, we would be OK.''<ep>
   More than 18 percent of the voters in Seminole, Orange and Volusia counties cast ballots, with Feeney winning every county.<ep>
   About one-quarter of the voters cast absentee ballots.<ep>
   Hattaway, a political newcomer, came close to winning Seminole County, which is the heart of the district. Voters in Sanford turned out in large numbersfor Hattaway, an attorney.<ep>
   Both candidates spent Saturday campaigning. Feeney knocked on doors in Orange County and Oviedo, while the Hattaway camp served barbecue and visited barbershops to entice voters in Sanford.<ep>
   ``I think we knocked on 7,000 doors today,'' Feeney said. ``It was incredible.''<ep>
   Volunteers for both political parties came from as far away as Tallahassee and Miami on Saturday to rally voters.<ep>
