   BELLEAIR SHORE (--) The beach in the Tampa Bay community of Belleair Shore might be beautiful and open to the public, but the mayor would rather you don't stay too long.<ep>
   ``We don't find it too much of a problem as long as people are moving,'' said Bob Clayton, who presides over the town of 120 residents and 51 beachfront homes most people couldn't possibly afford.<ep>
   There are no stores, motels or other businesses, and the mayor's effort to keep the beach pristine has caused quite a stir.<ep>
   He pushed for prosecution of a woman and her daughter last fall for drinking coffee out on the sand. After much publicity, the case was dropped.<ep>
   Clayton and other town commissioners then put gates at the three restricted beach parking lots. The gates prevent outsiders (--) including residents of Belleair Beach, just across the street (--) from using the beach after sunset.<ep>
   And last weekend the mayor confronted Andre Feliciano Rickards, 26, of Safety Harbor, after he illegally parked in a lot next to the mayor's home.<ep>
   The mayor is accused of grabbing Rickards' arm and ordering him, his girlfriend and her 2-year-old daughter from the beach. Rickards claims the mayor pushed a car door into his girlfriend, kicked the vehicle and screamed obscenities.<ep>
   When Rickards said he was going to call police, Clayton pulled out a gold badge and said he was the police. The Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney's Office is reviewing the case.<ep>
   ``It has a detrimental effect on our reputation,'' said Belleair Shore Commissioner George Jirotka, noting he's hearing some calls for the mayor's resignation. ``It seems to me something he did on his own. It was certainly not something that was sanctioned by us.''<ep>
   The town has no roads, and it pays adjacent Belleair Beach for police service. The last contested election was in the early 1980s. Commission meetings are at the mayor's house, with refreshments served.<ep>
   The average assessed value of homes in the city is $650,000 with a $12,000 property tax levy.<ep>
   The town is so protective of its privacy it even declined a government offer of free beach sand to avoid providing public access and parking.<ep>
   Clayton, a mechanical engineer and a commissioner since 1990, has lived in the community on and off for 30 years. The home he shares with his mother has an expansive back yard facing the Gulf of Mexico. <m1><ep>
<m0>   He has been bothered by beachgoers with portable CD players, a child who peered into his window like ``a pressed duck,'' copulating teens and people on his sea wall.<ep>
   The public has a right to walk the shore, but Clayton objects to them planting themselves and their beach umbrellas in front of his home for hours.<ep>
   ``What's the difference between that and loitering, stalking?'' said Clayton. ``You just have to say `Time to go to bed, folks. It's time to shut down.' ''<ep>
