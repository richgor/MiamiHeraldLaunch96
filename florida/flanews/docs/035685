<m0>   ALBANY, N.Y. (--) In a case similar to Florida's, a federal appeals court has rejected a bid by New York state lawmakers and county executives to have the federal government pay for the state costs of providing social services to illegal immigrants.<ep>
   Nine Republican state senators, joined by county executives in Nassau, Suffolk and Rensselaer counties, claimed that by failing to enforce federal immigration laws, the federal government was liable for any state funds spent on providing social services for illegal immigrants.<ep>
   A leader of the group said the decision may be appealed.<ep>
   State Sen. Frank Padavan, chairman of the Senate Majority Task Force on Immigration that filed the lawsuit, said Friday he might appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court (--) or join in a similar Supreme Court appeal already filed by Florida.<ep>
   New York and Florida are two of six states suing the federal government over immigration costs. Actions brought by the governors of Florida, California, Arizona, Texas and New Jersey were also dismissed in lower courts.<ep>
   The coalition had sought $33.6 billion for social services costs stretching back to 1988.<ep>
   However, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in upholding a lower federal court ruling, said there are no laws or constitutional clauses that require any reimbursement. In fact, the court named numerous precedents in which federal law can supersede state law even when it has an adverse effect on states.<ep>
   The appeals court decision, dated April 17, was made public Friday.<ep>
   ``The courts continue to maintain that while only Congress can regulate immigration, it is not obliged to contribute a nickel to immigration costs,'' said Padavan, R-Queens.<ep>
