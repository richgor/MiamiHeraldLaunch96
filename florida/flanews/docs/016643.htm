   PENSACOLA -- The Navy's new Flight Exhibition Team was still nameless nearly 50 years ago as the pilots eagerly looked forward to putting on a show in Omaha, Neb.<P>

   The base newspaper at Jacksonville Naval Air Station, where they had their headquarters, had held a contest to name the team, but the five pilots were unhappy with the winning choice: Lancers.<P>

   ``It just didn't have the right ring,'' recalled retired Capt. Roy M. ``Butch'' Voris, the team leader.<P>

   They were thumbing through The New Yorker magazine before a July 25, 1946, show at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha when they spotted an entertainment listing for the Blue Angel nightclub.<P>

   ``As soon as we saw the name `Blue Angel,' it rang a bell. That was it,'' Voris said in a telephone interview from his home in Monterey, Calif. ``At Omaha, we went in as the Flight Exhibition Team and came out as the Blue Angels.''<P>

   Not all the Navy brass was pleased with their selection.<P>

   ``But we worked through the press and we were heralded as `these Blue Angels,' '' Voris said. ``It overwhelmed everybody else and the name stuck.''<P>

   Over the next half-century, the Blue Angels went on to entertain millions of people across the nation and overseas, making their name famous.<P>

   Voris and five other former leaders will recall their Blue Angel exploits on May 9 at the National Museum of Naval Aviation in conjunction with the national convention of the Association of Naval Aviation.<P>

   The museum is on the grounds of the Pensacola Naval Air Station, the Blue Angels' home for the past 41 years. A formal golden anniversary celebration and reunion will be held during the team's homecoming air show in Pensacola Nov. 8-9.<P>

   Officially, the team was created to boost Navy morale, recruiting and public relations.<P>

   ``World War II was over and the military was shrinking,'' Voris recalled. ``All the good things the Navy had done . . . [started] to be forgotten.''<P>

   But there was another objective.<P>

   ``The reason was -- to get underneath all of these reasons -- to fight for your share, or more, of the budget,'' Voris said. ``My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues.''<P>

   At the time, the Navy and Army Air Force had a number of ad hoc air-show teams, but Voris' group got its marching orders from the highest levels.<P>

   Navy Secretary James V. Forrestal and Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, chief of naval operations, ordered the Naval Air Advanced Training Command to create an official Navy air show team in April 1946.<P>

   Voris, then a 26-year-old lieutenant commander and World War II ace with eight kills, was the command's chief instructor pilot. He was picked to build the team, selecting the planes, pilots and even the blue and gold color scheme still in use.<P>

   ``I was given the job without really any specific instructions other than to keep out of the public eye until we see what we're going to have -- train out over the swamps and so forth,'' Voris said.<P>

   Voris and two other pilots, Lt. Maurice Wickendoll, and Lt. j.g. Mel Cassidy, put on the first show June 15, 1946, at Jacksonville, flying F6F Hellcats, the Navy's most widely used fighter in World War II.<P>

   They soon were joined by Lt. Al Taddeo in a fourth Hellcat and Lt. j.g Gale Souse who flew the ``Beetle Bomb,'' a yellow SNJ Texan trainer with red-disk Japanese markings.<P>

   After doing some aerobatic maneuvers, the Hellcats would pounce on the fake Japanese ``Zero.'' Smoke would streak from the plane and a mechanic in the back seat would toss out a dummy pilot that would parachute to the ground.<P>

   After little more than a month, the newly named Blue Angels switched to smaller, more powerful F8F-1 Bearcats.<P>

   But tragedy struck in September. A new pilot, Lt. j.g Ross ``Robbie'' Robinson, was killed when his Bearcat's wing failed in Jacksonville.<P>

   Robinson was the first of 23 Blue Angels killed in crashes, including a narrator-pilot and a ground crew member riding as a passenger. But no spectator has been harmed, and the Blue Angels' safety record has steadily improved. The team has not had a fatal accident in the last 10 years.<P>

   In 1947, a new leader, Lt. Cmdr. Bob Clarke, created a diamond formation that became the Blue Angels' trademark. Two years later, the team switched to jet-powered F9F-2 Panthers.<P>

   The Blues disbanded in 1950 for the Korean War but were re-established the following year with Voris again in charge.<P>

   The faster jets needed more space to maneuver and the team eventually was expanded to its current six planes, while the Beetle Bomb was dropped. The two additional jets perform solo maneuvers while the four-plane formation is turning to make another pass in front of the crowd.<P>

   The Panther was the first of six types of jets the Blues have flown. For the past decade they have used the F/A-18 Hornet, the Navy's most modern combat jet.<P>

   Voris says the team looks better every year, although many maneuvers are the same or similar to those he developed 50 years ago.<P>

   ``I get this question all the time: `Did you ever think the team would turn out to be what it is today and that it would have gone 50 years?' '' Voris said. ``And I say, `That wasn't my primary thought. . . . That first year was just staying alive and getting something that would work.' ''<P>
