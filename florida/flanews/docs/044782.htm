    MELBOURNE -- In a setback for abortion rights advocates, Melbourne police on Saturday elected not to arrest six people who protested in a 36-foot buffer zone that surrounds a controversial abortion clinic.<P>

    The four youths and two adults expected to be arrested when they entered the zone around Aware Woman Center For Choice and knelt to pray. During the past three years, more than 200 people have been arrested for similar acts.<P>

    A 1991 court order establishing protest guidelines at the clinic was the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court decision two years ago. The decision said a woman's right to unrestricted health care took precedent over anti-abortion advocates' free speech rights. <P>

    ``This is an injunction, protecting women's health rights, passed by the Supreme Court of the United States,'' said Patricia Baird Windle, owner of the clinic. <P>

   ``Does this action today mean that Melbourne has seceded from the Union and doesn't have to enforce the rulings of the Supreme Court?''<P>

    A Melbourne minister, surprised and pleased by Saturday's events, disagreed.<P>

    ``It is nice to see that the city of Melbourne is coming to its senses,'' said the Rev. Luther Laite, whose daughter Lydia and three members of her church youth group entered the buffer zone and prayed for about 20 minutes.<P>

    ``As long as there are Christians on the earth, we are going to go where the darkness is,'' said Laite, pastor of Christian Life Family Church. ``There will be Christians here. We will go where the battle is.''<P>

    Saturday's protest was to have been a turning point of a different kind.<P>

    Florida anti-abortion groups, like others nationwide, are encouraging younger people to protest at clinics.<P>

    Involved Saturday were three teenagers and an 11-year-old, all part of the Melbourne church's youth group. They risked arrest by kneeling and praying just outside the clinic parking lot.<P>

    Many of the women getting abortions are in their late teens and early 20s, said the Rev. Chad Zody, youth pastor for the church. ``So it is important for them to see people this age.''<P>

    ``I feel like there are little babies dying in there, and I have to do what I can to stop it,'' said Dolly Edwards, 16. ``There is no more important place to pray than outside an abortion clinic.''<P>

    Added Lydia Laite, 14: ``If I save just one baby it's worth getting arrested.''<P>

    In 1993, more than 250 people were arrested for picketing in violation of the court order. After conflicting decisions from state and federal courts, the Supreme Court ruled, giving judges broad power to limit public protests. The court also upheld key parts of the Aware Woman court order that restricts the noisy face-offs between protesters and patients outside abortion clinics.<P>

    The court order setting up the buffer zone named six people and any member of three national anti-abortion activist groups, forbidding them from the buffer zone. It also prevents anyone else ``acting in concert or participation with'' them.<P>

    ``We didn't feel that any of the children were acting in concert with any of the original respondents in the injunction,'' said Ron Bell, community relations director of the Melbourne Police Department.     Other protesters -- including many who have been arrested -- have for months insisted that they are not ``in concert with'' anybody, but are acting on their own moral convictions.<P>
