   PORT ST. LUCIE -- Tiffany Beam's parents had safety in mind when they gave her a can of Mace for protection.<P>

   But at Port St. Lucie High School, Mace is considered a weapon, and officials suspended the freshman after finding it in her book bag. Citing the district's ``zero tolerance'' weapons policy, they have recommended the 14-year-old be thrown out of school.<P>

   Possession of a weapon on campus merits a 10-day suspension and a recommendation for expulsion, according to the school policy. But the state of Florida doesn't classify Mace as a weapon.<P>

   Beam's parents were concerned about her walking to her bus stop in the dark, after hearing about the murder of 9-year-old Jimmy Ryce, who was snatched from his rural Dade County school bus stop. Now they're most concerned about the effect the suspension will have on the girl's education.<P>

   ``My biggest concern is that this is going to stay on her permanent record,'' Beam's mother, Sally Hurley, said. ``It states `possession of a weapon.' It doesn't say it was Mace or that she never used it or even pulled it out.''<P>

   Beam's parents hired an attorney to plead her case before a hearing officer Tuesday and later to the School Board. They hope her good grades and plans for a career in medicine will persuade the School Board to let her stay in school.<P>

   ``All that we're asking of the School Board is that they use some rationality and common sense regarding weapons,'' attorney Michael Kessler said. ``The school obviously doesn't protect their kids at the bus stops or on their way to and from the bus stops. And we know there are predators out there.''<P>

   Jacob Gallmon, executive director for secondary schools, declined to comment, citing rules to protect a child's confidentiality.<BR>
