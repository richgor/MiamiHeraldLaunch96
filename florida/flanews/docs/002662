For about 90 minutes, controllers at the Hilliard air traffic control center couldn't receive messages from pilots. The center directs aircraft over about 160,000 square miles of the coastal South Atlantic.<ql>

   HILLIARD (--) Flights across the Southeast were delayed by as much as 90 minutes because of a radio failure at the air traffic control center north of Jacksonville.<ep>
   Controllers directing about 200 planes couldn't receive messages from the pilots, though they could still send instructions to them. <m1><ep>
<m0>   The problem, which began Friday at 10:24 a.m., lasted about an hour and 45 minutes.<ep>
   ``It was right smack-dab in the middle of our morning rush,'' said Joe Trainor, local president for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. ``Safety is definitely compromised when you have that many pilots in the sky and they can't communicate verbally with controllers.''<ep>
   The breakdown was caused by equipment in the radio system's power supply, said Kathleen Bergen, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman in Atlanta. Controllers at the Hilliard center in Nassau County direct aircraft over about 160,000 square miles of the coastal South Atlantic.<ep>
   The main effect of the breakdown was to make it harder to handle large amounts of air traffic.<ep>
   Controllers usually issue directions to several planes at once, Trainor said. Friday they radioed instructions to one plane at a time, and waited while the pilot acknowledged the message by pressing a transponder button that causes a light to appear on the controller's radar screen.<ep>
   To minimize air traffic during the breakdown, numerous departing flights were delayed at airports.<ep>
   The radio failure was less dramatic than some problems that have dogged Hilliard and other control centers. In October, controllers lost use of their primary radar for 47 minutes. In August 1993, the center lost use of its radar and radio for about 90 minutes.<ep>
   Hilliard is among several control centers nationwide where the FAA has complained about outdated equipment that needs replacement.<ep>
