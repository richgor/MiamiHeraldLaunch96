  TALLAHASSEE (--) A 7 percent boost in tuition at Florida's state universities (--) the first tuition increase in three years (--) is part of a budget agreement legislative leaders are struggling to complete today.<ep>
  For Florida's 10 public universities, this means about $20 million more this fall for additional classes, libraries, computer equipment and financial aid (--) the money to be distributed to each of the campuses where the increased tuition is collected.<ep>
  For the typical student, it's a tuition increase of about $80 a year.<ep>
  For the Legislature, it's one of many agreements that may enable a proposed new $40 billion state budget to go to the printer today.<ep>
  As usual, the final details of how $6 billion is divided among the state's 67 public school districts is one of the toughest 11th-hour issues (--) with Dade and Broward school lobbyists holding out for the additional money needed in their expensive districts. But sharp divisions over social services cutbacks are adding a new dispute just as tough to resolve this year.<ep>
  ``I'm pretty sure we can settle those, but we clearly have our work cut out for us,'' said Senate Ways and Means Chairman Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami, as round-the-clock budget talks headed into the night again Sunday. ``This'll be a long night, but that's all right (--) a lot of Cuban coffee.''<ep>
  Lawmakers will have three days to review the document, to be distributed Tuesday, and then vote on it Friday, the scheduled end of the 1996 session.<ep>
  But this 72-hour ``cooling-off period'' required by Florida's Constitution won't offer lawmakers a chance to do anything about parts of the budget they dislike. In the end, they must vote for or against the plan as negotiated by the Legislature's leaders (--) there's no amending it.<ep>
  A weekend agreement to raise tuition 7 percent represents a compromise. House leaders wanted to allow each of the campuses to raise it by as much as 10 percent and decide how to spend the money. The Senate's leaders wanted no new tuition but agreed to 7 percent only if it were statewide.<ep>
  In the bargain struck among House and Senate leaders, the campuses are to spend the new money on new sections for crowded courses, improving libraries and computer labs and student financial aid.<ep>
  ``It's an artful compromise, in the sense that everybody won something,'' said Charles Reed, chancellor of the universities.<ep>
  The next step is selling the tuition increase to Florida's Republican-led Senate, which has kept the state from raising general taxes for four years. If this and other agreements enable the Legislature to adjourn on time, says Senate President Jim Scott, the Senate should accept the new tuition.<ep>
  ``We can sell it,'' Scott, R-Fort Lauderdale, said. `'I think people will do it if it closes us out here. . . . As long as we don't go into overtime, I think I can sell it (--) though I'm getting a lot of questions.''<ep>
  ``It's certainly better than nothing,'' House Appropriations Chairman Buzz Ritchie, D-Pensacola, said. ``Some people had suggested that even 10 percent wasn't going to be enough to get the quality we need.''<ep>
  In the negotiations, leaders scrapped the idea of using some of the lottery's profits to offer university scholarships. <m1><ep>
<m0>  There simply are too many deserving students, too little classroom space and not enough money in the budget to enable a big share of lottery revenue to be set aside for scholarships, they say.<ep>
  ``That seems to be unworkable,'' Diaz-Balart said. ``There seems to be a consensus that that is unworkable.''<ep>
