   A rare plant has been discovered hiding along a protective fence line at the edge of a Dade County park. A mere dot, as fragile as a teenage heart, it is the buttery color of gold dust and has been found in only one other place on the globe.<P>

   Called sand flax (Linum arenicola), the wild herb is native only to the rock ridge pinelands of South Dade and Big Pine Key.<P>

   Previously recorded in only five sites in South Dade, sand flax is officially listed as endangered by the state of Florida and considered endemic by many botanists.<P>

   Facing extinction, its seeds are stored in a special bank at Fairchild Tropical Garden.<P>

   ``This is probably the rarest plant in South Florida,'' said Keith Bradley, research associate for the Institute for Regional Conservation.<P>

   Once it flourished -- without much note due to its wispiness -- in Dade from southern Coconut Grove to the edge of what is now Everglades National Park, he said.<P>

   It was discovered this month during a routine plant survey of the Camp Owaissa Bauer, a 110-acre park at 17001 SW 264th St. in the Redland.<P>

<P>

    Bradley and Roger Hammer, a naturalist for Metro-Dade Parks natural areas management, stumbled upon a tiny population of the wiry plants staking out a patch along a Cyclone fence bordering the park's Everglades Archery Range.<P>

   It was as if they happened upon a lost civilization.<P>

   ``The assumption was that all of its natural habitat has been destroyed,'' Hammer said. Distant kin to the plant from which linen is made, as well as linseed oil, Linum arenicola is ``dinky,'' in Hammer's words.<P>

   The pair counted 19 threadlike plants, from 8 to 10 inches high, huddled along the fence.<P>

   It is easy to miss. The flower, no bigger than the blunt end of a pencil, blooms for just one day before dying, its five petals falling away. A seed pod, no bigger than a pimple, forms, containing 10 microscopic seeds. A new flower opens the next morning.<P>

   Sand flax is easily shoved aside by bushier, more aggressive plants. It favors open rocky ground and does especially well after fires, once naturally occuring in the wild, Hammer said. It was recorded growing at Camp Owaissa Bauer in 1983, but was thought to be lost. The park has not been cleared in 20 years.<P>

   Bradley and Hammer speculate that the new colony found a home along the rocky fence line that is kept trimmed by parks personnel. An advisory is being issued to protect the site.<P>

   The only other recent locations where sand flax has been documented in Dade are on the grounds of Homestead Air Reserve Base, two other sites in the Redland and two spots along busy Old Cutler Road in South Dade.<P>

   Bradley estimates only a few thousand plants exist in Dade, mainly on the the hurricane-damaged air base.<P>

   Why is such a frail, seemingly unimportant plant worthy of note?<P>

   ``This plant is something we have that nobody else in the world has,'' Hammer said. ``That alone makes it special.<P>

   ``There is a lot we don't know. Before we allow anything to become extinct, we ought to know everything there is to know about it.''<BR>
