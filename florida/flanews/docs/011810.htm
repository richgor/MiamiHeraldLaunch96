    The University of Florida is telling its Jacksonville medical residents to quit working at abortion clinics in West Palm Beach, Central Florida and Tallahassee effective July 1.<P>

    Abortion providers, who say that they are suffering a dwindling supply of doctors, say the new policy will degrade health care for rural and poor women.<P>

    But anti-abortion activists are pleased, saying they have further reduced the availability of abortions in Central and North Florida.<P>

    The policy change, which the university says is being made for doctor-safety reasons, comes just days after anti-abortion protesters from Melbourne picketed the university for the first time. It was a bonus for anti-abortion activists who merely were trying to stop one doctor from traveling to Melbourne to do abortions.<P>

    ``We've never been picketed before,'' said Jan Olsen, medical school spokeswoman. ``They literally snuck in and put up their horrible fliers. We had telephone threats'' to medical residents doing abortions at clinics.<P>

    ``Those things led to a safety . . . and liability issue,'' Olsen said. ``It's not a moral issue, it is a safety issue.''<P>

    About a dozen protesters also marched outside the office and home of a medical graduate student, a licensed physician who was doing abortions for Aware Woman Clinic in Melbourne.<P>

    The doctor resigned from the Melbourne clinic the next day.<P>

    Within a week, UF's associate dean in charge of the Jacksonville medical campus met with other medical residents who also were doing abortions on their days off in at least three clinics from Tallahassee to West Palm Beach.<P>

    Residents are licensed physicians doing graduate training in a specialty. They are allowed to perform medical procedures, including abortions, without other supervision.<P>

    After the session, Dean Louis Russo handed down the new policy: Medical residents can only perform abortions at Jacksonville-area clinics and only after signing a waiver ``by you and your estate of any claim against the university should any injury or harm occur.''<P>

    To withdraw UF medical residents from clinics in greater Jacksonville would be too disruptive, Russo told the residents. But the Jacksonville campus bears no responsibility outside the greater Jacksonville area, thus the cutback.<P>

    Olsen said that policy change wasn't the medical residents' idea; it was the administration's.<P>

    The University of Miami medical school puts no such restrictions on its residents, nor does the state's third medical school, the University of South Florida.<BR>
    Although the new policy was welcomed by the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue-National in Dallas, it wasn't enough.<P>

    ``The way we win the battle is to go right to the schools,'' the Rev. Flip Benham said. ``The schools can't stand us marching with [pictures] of these little unborn baby boys and baby girls. We'll start [picketing in] Jacksonville until they stop.''<P>

    Meredith Raney, the Melbourne anti-abortion activist who led a group of 11 Central Florida activists to Jacksonville, also was happy.<P>

    ``This is good news that abortions will be curtailed all over the state,'' Raney said. ``The only reason we went to Jacksonville to picket is because that particular doctor was from Jacksonville. We wanted to put pressure on the main abortion provider in Brevard County.''<BR>
    Abortion providers say the new policy will make it much harder, especially for poor women in rural counties, to get reproductive health care, including abortions.<P>

    ``It is amazing that a small group of people can limit access to abortion and other women's health services across the entire state,'' said Reve Mitchell, director of North Florida Women's Health and Counseling Service, where part-time medical residents had performed about 25 percent of the clinic's abortions. ``The long-term effect is even worse,'' Mitchell said, because the other doctors who serve her clinic came up through the Jacksonville UF program.<P>

    ``I think [UF] is running scared,'' Mitchell said. ``Abortion is a hot issue.''<BR>
    Nationally known abortion rights activist Patricia Baird Windle, was angry with UF: ``It is time for this university to manifest the same kind of courage that abortion providers are manifesting all over the country,'' Windle said.<P>

    ``Only when we stand up to the tyranny of the terrorists can we win,'' she said.<P>

    Baird is owner of Aware Woman Center for Choice in Melbourne and West Palm Beach where four UF residents did about 1,500 abortions a year.<P>

    ``This is an issue of collateral extortion and the anti's are making it work,'' she said.<P>

    ``First they worked on the doctors at UF, and then they worked on the hierarchy at UF,'' Windle said. ``They just chip away at the foundation. Without clinics, there is no choice.''<BR>
