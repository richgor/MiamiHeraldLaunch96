<H2>Campus editor besieged by 2nd-guessers</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
By Jack Wheat<BR>

onday is D-Day at the University of South Florida.<P>

  D for detonation or D for dud.<P>

  The drama is taking place because a student named Deborah O'Neil decided she didn't want to be pushed around.<P>

  O'Neil is editor in chief of the USF campus paper.<P>

  On March 25, someone with the nom de plume ``The One, the Leader of the War Purgers'' swore to blow up the administration building and kill a white, female professor Monday unless O'Neil published his one-page manifesto.<P>

   Not long ago, The New York Times and The Washington Post were confronted with a demand from the Unabomber, who had a proven record as a killer. They published his 25,000-word manifesto.<P>

   O'Neil, facing a threat that might well be a college prank but could be the real thing, went the other way. <P>

   She decided to call ``The One's'' bluff.<P>

   O'Neil says she's pondered all those questions. But she believes she made the right calls.<P>

   She is not a typical student journalist. A 24-year-old senior from New Hampshire, she started college in Massachusetts, quit, joined the Army Reserve and worked as a reporter in Maine and Massachusetts. She came to USF in 1994 to finish her bachelor's degree. <P>

   Initially she dismissed the letter as a sick joke and nearly tossed it, O'Neil said. But alarm bells started going off. She read it again and again.<P>

   After all, Islamic intellectual-terrorists had set up shop in a think tank across the street from campus and gotten a toehold in USF. O'Neil had written about it. ``The One'' was well-versed in the controversy and upset about media coverage of it.<P>

   Even if The One wasn't what he claimed to be -- a neo-Nazi/Islamic terrorist -- he might still be a dangerous person on the loose. What really got her dander up was her supposition that The One thought student journalists could be bullied into printing what the big papers couldn't.<P>

   O'Neil decided she'd never publish such an inflammatory diatribe, but she couldn't let the threat go unnoted. She reported the threat in The Oracle, turned the letter over to authorities and started catching hell. Some critics think she's been hoaxed, others think she should have printed the thing just in case.<P>

   Last week, she took the flak and went without sleep to finish class work, take finals, produce a newspaper every day and cope with a siege from journalists around the country.<P>

  ``In Spanish class,'' she said, ``a buddy keeps teasing me and saying, `If something happens, it's all your fault.' ''<P>

  Some buddy.<P>

  Odds are little will happen at USF Monday except reporters, camera crews and law enforcement officers tripping over each other all day. But The One has wreaked unparalleled annoyance on the main campus of the state's second-largest university.<P>

  After experts studied the letter three weeks and couldn't give USF President Betty Castor the all-clear sign, Castor slammed spring semester onto the fast track. She merged final-exam week with the last week of classes. The 30,000 students and faculty were stressed and hacked.<P>

  By the weekend, USF was a heavily garrisoned ghost campus.<P>

  The furor has made O'Neil the most second-guessed student editor in memory. Her hope is that by the end of the week she'll be covering the news, not making it.<BR>
<P>

Jack Wheat covers higher education for The Herald.<P>
