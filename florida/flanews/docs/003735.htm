   SANFORD -- Attorneys who kept Joseph ``Crazy Joe'' Spaziano from Florida's electric chair have asked Seminole County to pay $100,000 for their expenses. <P>

   The bulk of the charges were for expert witnesses and investigative costs, but some charges are raising eyebrows.<P>

   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' Assistant County Attorney Susan Dietrich said.<P>

   Under Florida law, the county is required to reimburse reasonable expenses to Orlando attorney James Russ and the Holland & Knight law firm, the state's largest. Fees for expert witnesses, photocopies and deposition costs are routinely granted in many cases.<P>

   Russ and the firm defended Spaziano, a former Outlaw motorcycle gang member, for free. Spaziano, 50, won a new trial Jan. 22 after the star witness in his 1976 murder trial for the slaying of Orlando clerk Laura Harberts admitted to being forced to lie on the stand.<P>

   Prosecutors are appealing. Spaziano remains in prison on a 1975 rape conviction.<P>

   Tampa lawyer Gregg Thomas and Russ submitted a 2 1/4-inch-thick summary of bills on April 4. The case cost about $400,000 in lawyer time plus other costs that aren't included in the county bill, Thomas said.<P>

   Thomas headed a team of several lawyers and paralegals who worked with Russ, a well-known Orlando criminal attorney.<P>

   More than half the bill is for two expert witnesses a psychologist and an expert on hypnosis. <P>

   But the among expenditures that been most discussed is $24.15 in food and drinks for a defense investigator who went to a Casselberry topless bar. Russ said he believed that the investigator went to the bar because one of the key witnesses in the case was a topless dancer who had worked in the bar.<P>

   Thomas contends defense lawyers expected to bear some of the costs of representing Spaziano and asked for only those costs ``plainly necessary'' to prepare the case.<P>

   ``We wanted to be as conservative as possible,'' Thomas said. ``My feeling is we incurred these costs. If the judge decides to award them, fine. If not, our firm will absorb them.''<P>

   Seminole County officials are studying which items should be paid and which are questionable.<P>

   Defense attorneys will meet with county lawyers in about a week to negotiate the bill. Any disputed items will be decided by Seminole Circuit Judge O.H. Eaton Jr. at a May 17 hearing.<P>
