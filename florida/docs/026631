   BAY MINETTE, Ala. (--) Champion International Paper Co. will pay $5 million to settle pollution claims with 2,000 Florida and Alabama landowners, the company announced.<ep>
   A Baldwin County, Ala., judge approved the March 13 settlement Friday.<ep>
   Landowners filed suit in 1992, claiming that dioxin and other pollutants from Champion's plant in western Escambia County polluted Eleven Mile Creek and Perdido Bay, making the waters dangerous for wildlife and reducing the property values.<ep>
   The creek flows through western Florida, and the bay straddles the state line on the Gulf of Mexico.<ep>
   The average plaintiff will get a payment of $1,500 to $2,000, but those with property closest to the plant will get more, said Pete Grammas, a lawyer for the landowners.<ep>
   Their lawsuit had asked for $500 million in damages.<ep>
   ``If it had gone to court, a jury might have awarded $500 million. That's the uncertainty of litigation,'' Grammas said. ``But the class representatives overwhelmingly supported the settlement. They didn't just see it as a way to end the lawsuit.''<ep>
   The settlement releases Champion from liability for any property damage that occurred before the settlement date of March 13, but personal injury claims may still be filed, Grammas said.<ep>
   The company, which did not admit fault in the settlement, said it has spent $51 million since 1994 to reduce pollution from the plant.<ep>
   Spokesman Frank Westmark said Champion agreed to the settlement for economic reasons.<ep>
   ``When the plaintiffs brought the litigation, we said the suit was without merit. Nothing has changed. We're not liable for anything,'' he said.<ep>
   ``We agreed to the settlement proposal because it made it prudent business sense. It would have cost that much or more to defend ourselves in a trial.''<ep>
