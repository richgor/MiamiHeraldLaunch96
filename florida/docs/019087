<m0>   TALLAHASSEE (--) Hotels, oil drillers, Internet services and a fish museum that tacked tax breaks onto a huge bill as the Legislature closed better not count their money yet, Gov. Lawton Chiles said Wednesday.<ep>
   In the closing chaos, lawmakers turned a $1.5 million business-promoting tax break package approved by Senate committees into a ``tax train'' with enough loopholes hitched on to bring exemptions and credits to $45 million.<ep>
   ``I would say it may be a train going to nowhere,'' Chiles said.<ep>
   The governor pointed out that lawmakers slashed social services for the needy by $400 million in the $39.8 billion state budget they finally passed.<ep>
   Chiles questioned showering businesses with tax breaks ``at a time when we don't know if we can run the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services because of cuts we've made.''<ep>
   Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay said an analysis received by his office showed many of the tax train exemptions differed from those granted in a major economic development package passed at the end of the session.<ep>
   Those breaks (--) such as a sales tax exemption on electricity used in manufacturing (--) were favored by the administration based on what they would do for economic development, he said.<ep>
   But the exemptions hitched to the tax train didn't all meet that standard, and that may lead to a veto, said MacKay, reached in Washington.<ep>
   ``The more you overload that train, the greater the risk of derailment,'' he said. ``This one is pretty heavily loaded.''<ep>
   The package does include things the administration likes, such as a year's delay in taxing Internet services to businesses while a study panel examines the overall telecommunications tax picture.<ep>
   It includes benefits for ports and for enterprise zones that give companies incentives for creating jobs in economically depressed areas.<ep>
   ``Those are some of the things we'll have to weigh,'' Chiles said.<ep>
   If the Internet tax study dies with the tax train, Revenue director Larry Fuchs will ask Chiles to create a study panel by executive order, spokesman Chuck Springston said.<ep>
   But it hasn't been decided whether the tax would be collected while the study is being done.<ep>
   Other items, such as a five-year oil and gas severance tax exemption designed to encourage petroleum exploration, may not be doomed even if the bill fails.<ep>
   ``Hopefully not,'' said Brian Bibeau, lobbyist for the Florida Independent Petroleum Producers. ``It's on another bill as well.''<ep>
   Once Chiles considers how such incentives could stimulate the economy, Bibeau said, ``We feel hopefully he's going to sign it.''<ep>
   He added that many of the ``train'' provisions were from other bills that did win committee approval, or were passed by the House or Senate, and just ran out of time for final passage.<ep>
   That was the case with a sales tax exemption for complementary meals included in hotel bills, said Jim Tillman of the Florida Hotel and Motel Association.<ep>
   Tillman said the House passed a bill granting the break for the meals (--) such as the continental breakfast or kids-eat-free meals included in some room packages. A Senate bill won committee approval.<ep>
   But time ran out to finish passage of those bills, so the exemption was hitched to the tax train.<ep>
   Like the beneficiaries of more than 40 other breaks in the bill, said Tillman, ``We of course are keeping our fingers crossed that the governor won't veto it, but we are just one small item in there.''<ep>
