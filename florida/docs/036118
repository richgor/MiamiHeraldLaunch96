<m0>   TAMPA (--) Some fishermen who sold gill nets to the state after they were banned from Florida waters are buying them back at big discounts from a company the state hired to recycle them.<ep>
   The state Labor Department has asked that the company, Pollution Prevention Services, provide documentation about who is buying the nets and how the materials are being recycled.<ep>
   A constitutional amendment approved last summer by Florida voters outlawed several types of fishing nets in state waters.<ep>
   The Legislature allocated funds to buy these nets from fishermen, many of whom would be hit hard by the ban. The idea was that the buyout would help them and help discourage illegal fishing.<ep>
   About 3,000 miles of nets were brought in.<ep>
   The state picked Pollution Prevention Services to recycle the nets by selling the lead weights for use in car batteries and the plastic netting for making kitchen utensils in Taiwan.<ep>
   Now, a year later, many of those nets remain stockpiled in a warehouse near Tampa; others have been recycled at discount prices to commercial fishermen who had been were paid $500 to $3,500 apiece for nets they sold to the state.<ep>
   The company required buyers to sign an affidavit promising they wouldn't use them illegally. Commercial fishermen who bought nets say they have kept that promise.<ep>
   Company officer Charles Otero said the net buyback has been disastrous financially for Pollution Prevention Services and that all businesses but the net operations have been spun off to other companies.<ep>
   Don Hansen, a marine fisheries commissioner, called the company's handling of the buyback ``a complete fiasco. If you're violating the law already, what does an affidavit mean?''<ep>
