  A short-lived but vicious crime spree by a group of Lee County teenagers has left police and residents in the usually quiet Gulf Coast area stunned by the level of violence.<ep>
  So furious and brutal were the crimes (--) murder, arson, robbery, allegedly committed by teens with no criminal records (--) they reminded Sheriff John McDougall of the eerie characters in the book <m0>Lord of the Flies.<m0><ep>
  But this group had a different name.<ep>
  ``They called themselves the Lords of Chaos,'' McDougall said.<ep>
  <m4>Schwebes<m2><ql>
<m0>The string of crimes ended Friday when sheriff's deputies arrested five young men just as they were about to rob a restaurant.<ep>
  ``It had a life span of only two or three weeks. It was organized very quickly,'' McDougall said of the gang's activity. ``But it immediately turned into this vortex of crime, arson, murder. It was an unbelievable bloodlust that took on a life of its own.''<ep>
First, it was the school bus behind the Baptist church in East Fort Myers (--) set on fire and destroyed, nobody knew who did it, or why.<ep>
  Then it was the historic Coca-Cola bottling plant downtown (--) torched, gutted, for no discernible reason.<ep>
  Finally, it was a high school band director, gunned down on his front doorstep.<ep>
  In between were robberies, other arsons, and at least one carjacking.<ep>
  All were committed, police say, by the Lords of Chaos. Five members of the group, including their leader, have been arrested for the murder of Riverdale High teacher and band leader March Schwebes.<ep>
  Spearheading the horror, police say, was a 19-year-old who went by the nickname ``God.'' Kevin Foster had ``an obsession'' with guns, McDougall said, and had easy access to them because his father sold them at his pawn shop.<ep>
 ``He was a wild kid,'' the sheriff said.<ep>
  Foster, a former student at Riverdale High School, where all the gang members either attended or had graduated from, held some sort of inexplicable sway over his followers, McDougall said.<ep>
 ``They called him God,'' McDougall said. ``That should tell you something.''<ep>
  It was Foster who police say organized the gang April 13. He and his followers were fans of the Freemen, the militia members holed up on a ranch in Montana.<ep>
  But while the teens tried to pattern themselves after the militia, they didn't even know what the word meant, detectives say. They interpreted the word to mean gun-toting lawbreakers.<ep>
  One gang member told The Fort Myers News-Press that their next crime was going to be a trip to Disney World. The plan: steal costumes, then go on a shooting spree, targeting African Americans.<ep>
   Their most violent act, and the one that eventually led to their arrest, police say, was the murder of Riverdale High's band director, Schwebes.<ep>
  This is what informants told detectives:<ep>
  Last Tuesday, Foster and four of his followers planned to burn down the Riverdale High auditorium. But Schwebes drove by and saw them before they could set the fire. He confiscated some of their belongings, and told them to expect a visit from the school deputy the next day.<ep>
  Foster told his fellow Chaos members Schwebes had to die. They called information to get his address and phone number, called him to make sure he was home, and went to his house. Band member Derek Shields knocked on the door to make sure it was Schwebes who answered. Then he stepped aside, and Foster shot Schwebes in the head with a shotgun, then shot him again as he lay dying.<ep>
  On Friday, a few hours after the memorial service for the popular band leader, Foster and his gang planned to rob the Hardee's restaurant where one of the members works. Police found out about it, staked out the restaurant, and arrested five of the members, all of them armed.<ep>
  Arrested were Foster; Shields, 18; Christopher Paul Black, 18, a current student at Riverdale; Peter Edward Magnotti, 17, a current student at Riverdale; and Christopher Burnett, 17, a Riverdale drop-out who was attending night school there.<ep>
  Foster, Shields, Black and Magnotti are charged with first-degree murder and armed robbery. Burnett is charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery.<ep>
   McDougall said there are more Lords of Chaos in Lee County, and some witnesses fear retribution.<ep>
   ``We're seasoned law enforcement officers, we do this for a living, dealing with murder, rape, robbery,'' McDougall said. ``But we've all been absolutely shocked by this. We've never seen this level of violence wreaked on the community in such a short period of time by individuals so young.''<ql>
