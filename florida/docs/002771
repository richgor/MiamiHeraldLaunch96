   A big, flashy butterfly found only in Southeast Florida has risen on soft wingbeats from extinction's abyss.<ep>
   The Schaus swallowtail butterfly is soaring again.<ep>
   The showboat with brightly colored wings has been restored to the mainland where it had been declared extinct 72 years ago. And it is thriving in 10 growing colonies in the Florida Keys where only a few dozen individuals were isolated three years ago.<ep>
   Credit a determined and lucky University of Florida scientist who beat pesticide users, a powerful hurricane and hungry birds to save the swallowtail.<ep>
   Many of the swallowtails fluttering through South Florida's hardwood hammocks are zoologist Thomas Emmel's babies. They or their parents were raised in the lab that Emmel built in Gaines<m2><ql>

<m0>ville.<ep>
      Listed as endangered in 1976, the swallowtail is on a path that could make it the 12th species to graduate from the federal endangered species list. That, plus its sheer beauty has made the butterfly the toast of federal bureaucrats eager to show positive results to a tight-fisted Congress that has been hostile to endangered species protection.<ep>
   The show begins Monday afternoon when Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt releases a colorful blizzard of about 200 of Emmel's butterflies at a Dade County park, the Charles Deering Estate. Later this year, the U.S. Postal Service will feature the Schaus swallowtail among 10 endangered species on a new series of stamps.<ep>
   ``This could be the big success story that we've been wanting and needing,'' said Mark Yano, a federal biologist who worked on the Schaus project.<ep>
   The Schaus is a tailor-made symbol, federal officials say. Its 4 1/2-inch wingspan is streaked in rich yellow, trimmed with brown and splashed in magenta and iridescent blue. And its restoration has not inconvenienced private property owners since the butterfly is being placed only on public parks and refuges.<ql>
<m0>Once common in hammocks<ep>
<m0>   At the turn of the century, the Schaus was common in the hardwood hammocks between Miami and Key West. It thrived in the hammocks because of an evolutionary innovation: Unlike other butterflies, the Schaus could shift into reverse and fly backward.<ep>
   That enabled the swallowtail to live in tight quarters by dodging spider webs, thick vines and rough tree trunks.<ep>
   But the butterfly was no match for developers who wiped out most of the hammocks and pesticides that obliterated the last swallowtail on the mainland in 1924.<ep>
   By 1991, the surviving Schaus' swallowtails lived in four colonies on northern Key Largo and in Biscayne National Park. The butterfly was on the edge of extinction.<ep>
   It was in that year that Emmel, who had been studying the swallowtail for a decade, managed to help change a destructive course. He led a movement that persuaded federal, state and local authorities to ban a mosquito-killing pesticide, Baytex, that was responsible for the decline of the swallowtail and other beneficial insects that feed birds.<ql>
<m0>Captive breeding program<ep>
<m0>   And then Emmel finally got permission from federal and state officials to launch a captive breeding program in Gainesville. Captive breeding has helped the California condor, the black-footed ferret and the whooping crane. It had not been tried with a butterfly before.<ep>
   His timing couldn't have been better.<ep>
   Less than two months before Hurricane Andrew ripped through the remaining Schaus' swallowtail colonies, Emmel and his students collected 100 butterfly eggs (--) mere specks on the branches of trees in the hardwood hammocks on northern Key Largo and Elliott Key.<ep>
   In two colonies where there had been a few hundred butterflies prior to the storm, Emmel could find fewer than 50 in 1993. With so few butterflies left, that might have been the end of the species.<ep>
   But back in Gainesville, Emmel had a swallowtail farm going strong. The eggs he collected in 1992 had yielded 1,500 living pupae by 1994. The butterflies were thriving in a laboratory that Emmel raised money to build. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Butterfly work has its ups and downs. Last spring, Emmel and his research team distributed 760 pupae on popsicle sticks and distributed them in six sites in the Keys and in the Deering estate. It did not go well.<ql>
<m0>Waves of hungry birds<ep>
<m0>   Three times, strong cold fronts drove migrating warblers into southeast Florida and they devoured the pupae. Out of 150 pupae at the Deering estate, the birds ate 60, Emmel said. On some parts of Key Largo, 99 percent of the pupae were eaten.<ep>
   This year, Emmel will take no chances with warblers. He'll release adult butterflies that he'll take to hammocks in Styrofoam ice chests that will keep the insects cool and inactive. Aside from the 150 or so he brings from Gainesville, he'll be hatching pupae at the Butterfly World attraction in Coconut Creek.<ep>
   Emmel is eager to let the butterflies go. They're eating him out of house and home.<ep>
   ``We've scoured all nurseries from Gainesville to Ocala for nectar-producing plants,'' Emmel said.<ep>
   ``We've wiped them out for 30 square miles.''<ql>
