   University of South Florida President Betty Castor says she has no plans for the university to review its handling of the case of an undergraduate researcher who is in state prison for refusing to give the university the patent for an invention he claims is his.<ep>
   ``We take no pleasure in having someone incarcerated,'' Castor said Tuesday, but former USF student Petr Taborsky has no one but himself to blame.<ep>
   USF launched its criminal prosecution and separate civil lawsuit against Taborsky long before Castor became USF president in 1993. But USF's lawyers have assured her that Taborsky was responsible for his predicament, Castor said.<ep>
   ``The university felt strongly about the integrity of our research, the integrity of our faculty,'' Castor said.<ep>
   Officials believed Taborsky had stolen results of research paid for by Florida Progress Corp., a St. Petersburg-based utilities conglomerate, and the university had to do everything possible to recover them, Castor said.<ep>
   USF charged Taborsky with two felonies in 1989 because he refused to hand over personal notebooks that USF claimed contained data belonging to USF and a Florida Progress subsidiary.<ep>
   Taborsky, 34, said USF was using the criminal justice system to steal the ideas he had developed in independent research. But a Hillsborough jury sided with USF and convicted him of grand theft and theft of trade secrets in 1990.<ep>
   Upon his conviction six years ago, Taborsky turned over the notebooks, was placed on a year's house arrest and 15 years probation and ordered not to use any of the ideas for making the clay Clinoptilolite more effective at purifying waste water.<ep>
   He is now appealing the 1990 conviction. Hillsborough Circuit Judge Bob Anderson Mitcham ruled against him in March, and Taborsky has appealed to the Second District Court of Appeal in Tampa.<ep>
   In 1992, Taborsky was awarded a patent for a new process for using Clinoptilolite in waste-water treatment. At USF's behest, in 1993 a judge ordered him to sign the patent over to the university or go to prison for 3 1/2 years for violation of probation. He refused. <ep>
   After his appeals ended, he was jailed in Hillsborough County last October and transferred to a North Florida prison in January. He spent eight weeks on the state's chain gang and is now a prison gardener.<ep>
   ``Mr. Taborsky was given numerous opportunities'' to hand over the intellectual goods to USF and refused, Castor said. ``His actions in flouting the law'' are why he's in prison, she said.<ep>
   But Taborsky said all those opportunities have occurred without the university giving him a chance to show his ownership of the ideas.<ep>
