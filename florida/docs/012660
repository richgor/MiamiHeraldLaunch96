<m0>   TAMPA (--) A judge facing disciplinary action for jailing a woman who cried in court faces criticism for giving custody of three children to a father accused of abusing them.<ep>
   The judge said he was troubled by the mother's pregnancy by another man and by her work at night.<ep>
   The new baby of Michelle Dudek would interfere with raising her other three children, who need ``a man's presence,'' Hillsborough Circuit Judge J.T. Taylor wrote in a ruling giving custody to her ex-husband, Gary Lee Dudek.<ep>
   The mother has started a second family, which will ``interfere considerably'' with the present family unit and cause two allegiances as far as the children are concerned, Taylor said.<ep>
   The judge also penalized the mother for having a job that required her to work nights.<ep>
   Besides losing her children, Michelle Dudek was ordered to pay $450 a month child support.<ep>
   Authorities in California previously had determined the father physically abused the children and their mother. They obtained a court order to prevent the father from having unsupervised contact with the children.<ep>
   But Taylor disagreed and sent the children to live with their father in Florida permanently. She now works in Sebring to be near the children.<ep>
   ``Where has he been? Hello?'' said Margaret Zeller, president of the Hillsborough chapter of the National Organization for Women. ``His past history shows he's biased against women.''<ep>
   Taylor was unavailable for comment Friday.<ep>
   Michelle Dudek said she doesn't have enough money to appeal the judge's decision.<ep>
   In December, Taylor sent a woman to jail when she ran crying from his courtroom after he denied her request for protection from a husband she said had raped her.<ep>
   The Judicial Qualifications Commission, the agency that supervises the conduct of judges, filed formal charges against Taylor last month.<ep>
   Taylor, who has been on the bench since 1983, might escape penalty. At 69, he is not running for re-election. The charges will be dropped if he retires, a commission spokesman has said.<ep>
