<m0>   GAINESVILLE (--) A small fly may help poultry producers save thousands of dollars on pesticides and help the environment by eating the common house fly.<ep>
   ``Not only will producers profit and the environment benefit from decreased pesticide use, but of course the people living around these poultry farms will find less problems with house flies as well,'' Roger Jacobs said of the black garbage fly (also known as the dump fly.)<ep>
   The Hillsborough County Cooperative Extension agent and poultry specialist with the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences says the fly is slightly smaller than the house fly.<ep>
   Both flies can be found in garbage dumps and poultry manure, but the predator fly prefers darker spots like floors and manure pits. It does not typically enter the upper levels in chicken houses or neighboring homes.<ep>
   Dump fly larvae are voracious predators of house fly maggots, making them important biological control agents, said Jerry Hogsette, a USDA research entomologist and IFAS assistant professor.<ep>
   Unlike the house fly, the dump fly larvae have the ability to paralyze their prey, and will kill even more house fly larvae than they eat.<ep>
   This is the first time the predator fly has been available to the state's poultry producers. Originally trapped on a poultry farm in Hillsborough County, Hogsette established a colony of dump flies several years ago at a research laboratory in Gainesville.<ep>
   Zephyr Egg Co. in Pasco County has more than two million laying hens on five farm complexes. Production manager Frank Bennett said using the dump fly in several locations has worked very well in controlling house flies.<ep>
   Ranked ninth in the nation for commercial egg production, Florida's industry provides $100 million in farm value annually to the state. With most of Florida's 10.5 million laying hens on Central Florida farms, the state's chicken houses have become prime breeding sites for flies, irritating farmers and neighbors alike.<ep>
   Some evidence suggests house flies may transmit salmonella bacteria from manure to chickens and potentially to humans, he said.<ep>
   Many producers now use insecticide sprays in poultry houses or a larvicide mixed in the feed for house fly control.<ep>
