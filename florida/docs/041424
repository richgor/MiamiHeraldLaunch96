<m0>  After it all started to unravel, after police found the bloodstains in the apartment, after his wife gave a tearful confession, after the hoax of his missing stepdaughter was uncovered, John Zile decided to ``do the right thing'' and lead detectives to the body, a police officer testified Monday.<ep>
   As testimony in Zile's first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse trial entered its second week in West Palm Beach, jurors heard from the officer who took Zile's confession late one night in October 1994.<ep>
   Zile told Riviera Beach detective Lt. Edward Brochu that ``he wanted to do the right thing,'' Brochu testified.<ep>
   Once his confession started spilling out, Zile became so helpful that he even drew on a map where police would find the body of his 7-year-old stepdaughter, Christina Holt.<ep>
   He took police to the burial site in the woods behind a Tequesta Kmart, Brochu said. When they still couldn't find the body, Zile drew a map for them.<ep>
   Before that, he told Brochu what happened 41 days earlier in the tiny Singer Island apartment that Zile and his wife, Pauline, shared with their young sons Chad and Daniel and with Christina, Pauline's daughter from another marriage.<ep>
   It was around midnight, Zile told Brochu, and he was questioning the little girl about ``previous sexual activity'' that he alleges she had with one of his boys. Christina was a ``problem type child,'' Zile told Brochu.<ep>
   ``He started disciplining Christina Holt, striking her several times on the buttocks and lips,'' Brochu said. ``He observed visual injuries, bleeding lips, puffy lips.''<ep>
   Zile said Christina then went into a seizure, fell to the floor, and her heartbeat sped up, then slowed down. He tried to revive her with CPR, smelling salts, and by submerging her in a tub of cold water.<ep>
   Then he wrapped her body in a blanket and stuck it in a closet, where it stayed for four days until he found a place to bury it. Singer Island wouldn't do, he told Brochu.<ep>
   ``Because of the water level, the body would come up,'' Brochu quoted Zile as saying.<ep>
   Zile, 34, took notes while Brochu testified. Earlier in the day, he watched as jurors filed by evidence that police collected at the burial site (--) the blue tarp and plastic Power Rangers tent in which he wrapped Christina's body. The items were not brought into the courtroom because of the odor, and a court employee sprayed them liberally with ``a water-based odor neutralizer'' before jurors viewed them.<ep>
   Zile and his attorneys maintain that what happened that night of Sept. 16, 1994, was an accident. Christina died of a seizure after Zile administered corporal punishment, they say.<ep>
   But prosecutors say Zile beat the girl until she choked on her own vomit and died. They say they will seek the death penalty if he is convicted.<ep>
   His wife, Pauline Zile, was convicted of murder and aggravated child abuse last year and sentenced to life in prison.<ql>
