<m0>   KEYSTONE HEIGHTS (--) The two veterans were moved from grave sites in remote North Florida woods on a two-wheeled cart and reburied in pine boxes as a bugler in Confederate uniform played <m0>Confederate Tattoo<m0> and a National Guardsman played <m0>Taps.<m0><ep>
   A century after William Riley Glisson and Isaac Tyre died, the Civil War veterans' remains were moved to Gadara Cemetery near Keystone Heights.<ep>
   The reinterment Sunday was conducted in full military pageantry by uniformed members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who presented a 23-gun salute with Civil War rifles.<ep>
   At least 100 spectators witnessed the very Southern event. Many wore period costume (--) some women wore black with veils in the 90-degree heat.<ep>
   The caskets were taken to the cemetery by men pulling a limber, a two-wheeled cart used to carry ammunition caissons during the Civil War.<ep>
   Descendants of Glisson, a cavalryman, and Tyre, an infantryman, said they were glad their ancestors finally had been laid to rest near other family members and friends.<ep>
   ``They were very close friends,'' said Merrill Glisson of his grandfather and Tyre. ``I think getting the bodies moved is outstanding, primarily because Gadara Cemetery is sort of a family cemetery for all the Glissons.''<ep>
   Gayward Hendry, a leader in the Clay County Sons of Confederate Veterans who helped arrange the reinterment, said Glisson and Tyre were close wartime buddies. ``They had made a pact to be buried together.''<ql>
