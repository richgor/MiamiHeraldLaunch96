<m0>   JACKSONVILLE (--) A jailed suspect charged with murdering his former girlfriend, her father and brother waived his initial court appearance Friday.<ep>
   Dentcho ``Danny'' Denev, 38, was returned to Jacksonville on Thursday after being arrested in North Carolina. He is charged with first-degree murder for the shootings of Irina Leonova, 37, her brother Sergey Zadnepryanets, 34, and their father, Yuriy Zadnepryanets, 62.<ep>
   While being escorted from the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office to the county jail Thursday, Denev attempted to explain his actions.<ep>
   ``It was jealous love. . . . It was love and hate mixed together,'' said Denev, who had dated Leonova but recently was spurned by her.<ep>
   ``It all happened so fast. I cannot remember what happened,'' he said of the shootings early Monday morning. ``Of course I'm sorry what happened.''<ep>
   Denev also is charged with aggravated battery in the wounding of Leonova's 8-year-old son Kirill, who is in good condition in University Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the right shoulder.<ep>
   Denev, a Bulgarian auto mechanic who came to the United States five years ago, said he needed help before the shootings.<ep>
   ``Where was everybody when I needed help?''<ep>
   He was arrested in Sampson County, N.C., after a state trooper found him sleeping in his car Tuesday along Interstate 40. He said his car ran out of gas.<ep>
   Public Defender Bill White, whose office was appointed to represent Denev, said his client was under a lot of stress when he spoke to reporters.<ep>
   Prosecutors plan to take the case to a grand jury as early as next week to seek a first-degree murder indictment.<ql>
