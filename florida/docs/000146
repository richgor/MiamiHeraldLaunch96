<m0>   JACKSONVILLE (--) Two dozen sweaty park rangers let out a cheer when they completed a job of fitting a slab of broken masonry back into the wall of a 180-year-old slave cabin at the Kingsley Plantation.<ep>
   The rangers were repairing the work of vandals who park officials said pulled part of the wall down last year.<ep>
   The rangers, some from as far away from Alaska, were at the historic site Tuesday on Fort George Island as part of a program held every two years by the National Park Service's Williamsport Preservation Training Center in Maryland to teach rangers how to preserve and maintain historic areas.<ep>
   ``The wonderful thing about the Kingsley Plantation is that not only do you have an excellent example of colonial buildings, but maybe the largest collection of tabby slave quarters,'' said Tom McGrath, chief of the training center.<ep>
   The work is being done to preserve history rather than re-create it, McGrath said.<ep>
   ``Training in the field is a good classroom,'' he said.<ep>
   Dennis Walsh, a ranger from Valley Forge National Park in Pennsylvania, was curious about tabby, the material used to build the cabins. It is a mixture of lime, sand and oyster shells.<ep>
   ``I like it because it's a different kind of material than I've ever seen before,'' Walsh said.<ep>
   The plantation was the setting for one of the most colorful chapters in Florida history. Zephaniah Kingsley, a white plantation owner, and Anna Madgigine Jai Kingsley, a black woman he acknowledged as his wife, held African slaves and thousands of acres of rich, productive farmland in the early 1800s.<ep>
   The rangers have another wall in another cabin to stabilize and plan to cut some overhead branches because shade makes the tabby susceptible to decay.<ep>
