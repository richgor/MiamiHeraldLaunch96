<m0>   SEATTLE (--) A second sea lion suspected of overindulging in steelhead at the Ballard Locks has been caught and shipped to Tacoma's Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium, bound eventually for a new home at Sea World of Florida.<ep>
   The huge, bewhiskered critter, identified as No. 45, is one of five targeted for capture. It was caught Thursday night. Another (--) No. 225 (--) was caught Monday, according to a news release issued jointly by state, federal and zoo officials.<ep>
   It is not clear when the animals will be shipped to Orlando. It will save time and money for Sea World to take as many sea lions as possible at one time.<ep>
   Earlier this year, after a change in the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the state got federal permission to kill the five most voracious sea lions among those that gobble steelhead migrating through the locks.<ep>
   The plan was approved after years of unsuccessful attempts to deter the animals with firecrackers, rubber bullets and air horns.<ep>
   But it drew an outcry and a lawsuit from environmental groups, who blame the man-made locks for the problem.<ep>
   In April, Sea World volunteered to provide a home for the all-too-efficient anglers (--) Nos. 41, 45, 87, 225 and 17. <m1><ep>
<m0>   The Humane Society of the United States, based in Washington, D.C., says neither Washington state nor the federal agency has the authority to send the animals to Sea World. A society official suggested the state simply hold the animals at Point Defiance until the steelhead spawning run ends later this month.<ep>
