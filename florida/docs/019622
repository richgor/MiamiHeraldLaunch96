<m0>   ORLANDO (--) Apart from putting up a chain link fence, Volusia County is doing all it can to keep cars away from endangered sea turtles along 41 miles of beach, a lawyer told a federal judge Tuesday.<ep>
   ``We went way beyond'' the court's instructions to protect turtle-nesting sites, attorney Jeffrey Keiner told U.S. District Judge Anne C. Conway.<ep>
   Keiner was trying to keep the judge from finding the county in contempt of court on allegations that it violated the judge's order to keep vehicles away from turtles, their eggs and hatchlings.<ep>
   Conway ruled last August that Volusia was in violation of the federal Endangered Species Act. She banned nighttime vehicle traffic on its beaches and prohibited daytime driving and parking in ``conservation zones'' that range 30 feet seaward from turtle-nesting dunes.<ep>
   The county scrambled to comply after nine decades of allowing motorists to drive at will along the hard-packed Atlantic Ocean beachfront.<ep>
   Volusia put up thousands of plastic poles and warning signs to keep cars out of the protection areas. Its four-part strategy included the marked zones, regulation, enforcement and education, Keiner told the judge.<ep>
   ``We have taken serious, dramatic and lengthy steps to comply with the court's order,'' he said. ``It is fundamentally unfair to punish Volusia County for scofflaws of its zero-tolerance policy.''<ep>
   But Lesley Blackner, attorney for conservationists Shirley Reynolds and Rita Alexander, said the county's efforts had been haphazard and inadequate.<ep>
   ``The current enforcement method clearly isn't working, and the conservation zones aren't being protected,'' said Blackner, who furnished the court videos, photographs and testimonials from residents about infractions.<ep>
   Reynolds and Alexander sued the county last year, resulting in Judge Conway's order, effective during the turtle-nesting seasons from May 1 to Oct. 1.<ep>
   Along with trying to cope with the driving restrictions (--) and angry reaction from beachgoers, concessionaires and nearby businesses (--) the county also has drawn up and submitted a turtle-protection plan to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<ep>
   The plan would modify the judge's order and comply with federal law by imposing a driving ban in areas where turtles are most likely to nest and less-stringent rules in areas where they don't.<ep>
   Assistant County Attorney Jamie Seaman, one of seven lawyers for Volusia County in the courtroom, said she was confident the judge would reject the contempt motion.<ep>
   The judge did not indicate when she would rule.<ep>
   Reynolds said outside the courtroom that ``a lot of the problem on the beach is that there is very little, or no, law enforcement.''<ep>
   She said the county does not have the officers and guards it claims to have on patrol ``and this encourages traffic and violations.''<ql>
