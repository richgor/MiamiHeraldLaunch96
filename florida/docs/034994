<m0>   KISSIMMEE (--) The baby's crying woke him up four or five times, and 14-year-old Joey Coffman was tired when he got up to go to school.<ep>
   But Joey perked up when he packed up the baby (--) along with diaper bag, car seat and infant carrier (--) and took it to Horizon Middle School and turned it over to his teacher.<ep>
   The computerized doll, invented three years ago, is one of the newest tactics against teen <m4>JOEY<m2><ql>
<m0>pregnancy. Joey's school started using it this year, along with Osceola County's four high schools.<ep>
   The program called ``Baby, Think It Over'' aims to give students a taste of life with an infant. More than 15,000 of the dolls have been sold to schools and community groups across the country, said Carol Lambert, a spokeswoman for the manufacturer.<ep>
   A catalog describes the doll, available in Asian, black, Hispanic and white models, as ``adorable, cuddly and programmed to shriek at random intervals all day and all night.''<ep>
   Joey knew he had to scrap his after-school basketball game when it was his turn to take the doll home last week. But he thought he might get in a little time on his family's computer before dinner.<ep>
   But the sound of a crying infant filled the house soon after he arrived home. And it got worse.<ep>
   The faux-child was cranky.<ep>
   ``It gets kind of frustrating,'' Joey said.<ep>
   A programmed microprocessor in the doll's back makes it cry unexpectedly. A key students wear on their wrists can stop the unnerving crying (--) but not always right away. Students sometimes must keep the key in the doll's back for 20 or 30 minutes to simulate how long it would take to feed a real infant.<ep>
   Horizon uses the doll in its eighth-grade family and consumer science class. Each student keeps the doll for 24 hours, taking it with them wherever they go.<ep>
   ``It's a much more meaningful experience than just reading about it,'' said teacher Maria Rodriguez. ``That doll has made some of them change their opinions.''<ep>
   It did for Heather Kester, 13.<ep>
   ``I thought it was going to be easy,'' said Heather. ``Then when it started crying . . .''<ep>
   Roused from a sound sleep before dawn, Heather spent nearly 30 minutes sitting with the crying doll.<ep>
   ``I thought when I was like 18, I'd have a baby. But uh-uh,'' she said. ``When I have a real baby, I'm not going to be going to school.''<ep>
