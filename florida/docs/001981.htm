   TALLAHASSEE -- A sedative known as the date-rape pill can be classified with dangerous drugs like heroin, though the Legislature does not agree, Attorney General Bob Butterworth said Wednesday.<P>

   Butterworth has the power to pass a rule moving Rohypnol from a category of drugs with a low potential for abuse -- like Valium -- into the toughest category.<P>

   The Legislature has classified Rohypnol, nicknamed roofies, as a drug with some medical use. But Butterworth wants to classify the illegal drug as one with no medical value.<P>

   A Broward County prosecutor has asked Butterworth to crack down on the illegal drug.<P>

   Broward and the rest of South Florida is ``experiencing an epidemic of abuse of the drug,'' according to State Attorney Michael Satz.<P>

   Between October 1994 and last September, federal drug agents in Miami seized about 42,000 roofie tablets. Between last October and February, more than 136,000 tablets were seized.<P>

   ``Our office has six pending sexual battery cases, which are directly linked to `roofies,' '' Satz wrote Butterworth on Tuesday. ``A defendant who was recently convicted and sentenced bragged that he had raped many women after slipping them a `roofie.' ''<P>

   Roofies have been used in several sexual assaults in the South Florida town of Cooper City, including one in which three teenagers were charged in March with repeatedly raping a girl after crashing a Sweet 16 party and spiking her drink with the sedative.<P>

   Used in some 60 counties to alleviate insomnia, the drug is not approved for use in the United States. At least 10 times stronger than Valium, the sedative can impair a person's ability to move, think and react in addition to causing memory loss.<P>

   Early Saturday, in the final hours of the two-month legislative session, lawmakers passed a bill keeping roofies classified with drugs that have an accepted medical use and whose abuse may lead to limited physical or psychological dependence.<P>

   However, lawmakers increased the penalties to equal those reserved for drugs with no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Using the drug is now a first- or second-degree felony, which carries stiff prison terms.<P>

   Gov. Lawton Chiles has not acted on the legislation.<P>

   But Butterworth warned Wednesday that splitting the classification and the penalty is unprecedented, and prosecutors didn't think the tougher penalties could be applied.<P>

   Butterworth has filed a notice of intent to adopt an administrative rule to strengthen Rohypnol's classification. His office also has scheduled a public hearing for June 17 in Fort Lauderdale.<P>

   On the federal level, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is taking steps to reclassify Rohypnol as a drug with no accepted medical use in the United States.
