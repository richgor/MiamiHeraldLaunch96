<m0>   FERNANDINA BEACH (--) Conditions at the Nassau County jail ``fall beneath the standards of human decency,'' according to a class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in Jacksonville.<ep>
   Jacksonville lawyers Bill Sheppard and Dan Smith filed the lawsuit Friday against Nassau County on behalf of all the inmates at the jail, asking that conditions at the facility be corrected. The action also seeks unspecified damages, costs and attorneys fees from Nassau County.<ep>
   In the past several years, the Florida Department of Corrections has made several complaints concerning crowding and maintenance problems, including a leaky roof. Last year, the Nassau County jail averaged 115 inmates daily for much of the year.<ep>
   While Nassau County commissioners have discussed chronic crowding conditions at the 103-bed jail, they have opted for more study before enlarging the facility.<ep>
   The only named plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit are inmates Ricky Darby, Nathaniel Green and James Plyler.<ep>
   According to the lawsuit, Darby slipped on standing water from a leak and hurt his back. He requested medical attention, but got none for several days. A doctor then prescribed a muscle relaxer.<ep>
   Green developed a painful rash after being jailed March 9, but got no medical attention for several days, while Plyler was injured tripping over an inmate who was sleeping on the floor due to crowding, the suit alleges.<ep>
   Additional allegations listed in the lawsuit include:<ep>
   (box) Housing in the same cells of juveniles, adults, inmates with communicable diseases or mental or physical disabilities,<ep>
   (box) Forcing inmates to eat in clear view of leaking or clogged toilets,<ep>
   (box) Jail shower stalls with backed up raw sewage,<ep>
   (box) Lack of recreational activities for inmates.<ep>
   Nassau County sheriff's officials said Sheriff Ray Geiger hadn't been served with the lawsuit Friday. Geiger has pressed for a new jail at a central county complex in Yulee, but county officials say that could take several years.<ep>
