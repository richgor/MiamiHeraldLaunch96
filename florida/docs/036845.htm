   JACKSONVILLE -- A new desegregation agreement between the Duval County School Board and the NAACP calls for construction of 14 schools.<P>

   The plan mandates black enrollment of 20 percent to 55 percent at targeted schools.<P>

   By the end of 1996-97 school year, 106 of 148 schools must meet desegregation goals, up from the current 93.<P>

   By voting 5-1 to approve the plan Tuesday night, the School Board took a major step toward ending its decades-long dispute with the NAACP on how best to desegregate Jacksonville schools. No busing is required.<P>

   ``I'll feel total relief once the NAACP takes the vote,'' said School Board Chairwoman Cheryl Donelan.<P>

   The pact worked out during the weekend after three months of court-ordered mediation must still win approval from local and national officials of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.<P>

   The vote to approve the new schools kicks off a seven-year, $318 million building plan.<P>

   Some board members and parents have long urged new construction to relieve crowding in fast-growing areas, but the proposals have been held up by the dispute.<P>

   Both sides were ordered into mediation in January for failing to meet goals set in 1990.<P>

   The NAACP plays a key role because it is the plaintiff in a 35-year-old lawsuit against the board.<P>

   The local chapter's executive committee is expected to vote on the proposal later this week. The general membership, branch administrator and national legal counsel also must agree.<P>

   The proposal is slightly different from a version adopted by the School Board last month but never approved by the NAACP.<P>

   Leaders of the civil rights group feared the earlier version would not do enough to ensure the board would meet integration goals.<P>

   Both proposals called for building the new schools over seven years and pumping $10.8 million into magnet schools and steadily increasing the number of schools that would meet desegregation goals.<P>

   Six schools would be built in the first two years of the plan, including one in a predominantly black neighborhood. Three of the 14 new schools are in blacks areas.
