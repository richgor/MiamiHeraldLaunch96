<m0>   TALLAHASSEE (--) (AP) (--) Just one ticket matched all six numbers drawn in this week's Florida Lotto game to win the estimated $17 million jackpot, the state Department of the Lottery reported Sunday.<ep>
   That sole jackpot-winning ticket was bought in the Osceola County community of St. Cloud.<ep>
   The five winners of red Cadillac Sevilles in a second round of drawings were G.W. Gunn of Winter Haven; Jack Turney of Wesley Chapel; Marie Hagen of Dunedin; Therese Churchman of Flander, N.J.; and Donna Buggica of Tampa.<ep>
   Five winners of the cars are being announced each Saturday until all 25 winners are known.<ep>
   In Saturday's Lotto drawing, 402 tickets matching five of the correct numbers each were worth $1,033, while the 20,877 tickets with four winning numbers can be redeemed for $47.50 each.<ep>
   Payoffs of $3.50 go to all of the 363,147 tickets that got three of the correct Lotto numbers.<ep>
   The Lotto numbers drawn Saturday night were 49-7-12-24-10-22.<ep>
