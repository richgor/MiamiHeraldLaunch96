<m0>   FORT MYERS (--) Four current and former students of a Lee County high school were charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of the school's band director, authorities said Saturday.<ep>
  The four teenagers killed Mark Schwebes, 32, at home Tuesday because they didn't want him to turn them in for plotting to burn down the school auditorium, the sheriff's office said in a release.<ep>
   Arrested and charged late Friday were Christopher Paul Black, 18; Derek Shields, 18; Peter Edward Magnotti, 17; and Kevin Don Foster, 18. Black, Shields and Magnotti were enrolled at Riverdale High School, where Foster was a former student.<ep>
   Authorities said the four belonged to a gang called The Lords of Chaos and participated in carjackings, arson, armed robbery and auto thefts in the area, including setting fire to the historic Coca-Cola building.<ep>
   The foursome went to Riverdale High on Tuesday to burn the auditorium, but Schwebes foiled the attempt, the sheriff's office said. Later that night, the four went to Schwebes' home, and when he emerged, Foster shot him twice, the sheriff's office said. The teens feared Schwebes would later be able to identify them.<ep>
   They were arrested Friday while en route to rob a Hardee's restaurant, the sheriff's office said. In addition to the murder charges, the teens face a host of others, including robbery, arson and possession of firearms.<ep>
   Also arrested Friday and charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery was Christopher Burnett, 16, who attended night school at Riverdale High.<ep>
   Meanwhile, the funeral for Schwebes, a former U.S. Marine who had a spotless school district personnel file and above-average evaluations, is scheduled for Monday.<ep>
   The Long Island, N.Y., native had been at Riverdale High for about a year.<ep>
