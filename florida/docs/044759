<m0>   KEYSTONE HEIGHTS (--) The two veterans were moved from gravesites in remote North Florida woods on a two-wheeled cart and reburied in pine boxes as a bugler in Confederate uniform played <m0>Confederate Tattoo<m0> and a National Guardsman played <m0>Taps.<m0><ep>
   A century after William Riley Glisson and Isaac Tyre died, the Civil War veterans' remains were moved to Gadara Cemetery near Keystone Heights.<ep>
   The reinterment Sunday was conducted in full military pageantry by uniformed members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who presented a 23-gun salute with Civil War rifles.<ep>
   At least 100 spectators witnessed the very Southern event. Many wore period costume (--) some women wore black with veils in the 90-degree heat.<ep>
   The caskets were taken to the cemetery by men pulling a limber, a two-wheeled cart used to carry ammunition caissons during the Civil War.<ep>
   Descendants of Glisson, a cavalryman, and Tyre, an infantryman, said they were glad their ancestors finally had been laid to rest near other family members and friends.<ep>
   ``They were very close friends,'' said Merrill Glisson of his grandfather and Tyre. ``I think getting the bodies moved is outstanding, primarily because Gadara Cemetery is sort of a family cemetery for all the Glissons.''<ep>
   Gayward Hendry, a leader in the Clay County Sons of Confederate Veterans who helped arrange the reinterment, said Glisson and Tyre were close wartime buddies.<ep>
   ``They had made a pact to be buried together,'' Hendry said.<ep>
   The original tombstones, which were moved to the new graves within a mile of the original burial site, are inscribed with the names, military units and dates the two men died:<ep>
   (box) William Riley Glisson, Co. B, Second Regiment, Florida Cavalry. Died Feb. 10, 1898.<ep>
   (box) Isaac Tyre, Co. K, Third Regiment, Florida Infantry. Died Oct. 28, 1891.<ep>
   As residential development increased in the area about 25 miles northeast of Gainesville, family members grew increasingly worried about the graves being destroyed by land-clearing crews and construction equipment.<ep>
