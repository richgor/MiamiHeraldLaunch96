<m0>   EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE (--) Nearly 200 military positions will be eliminated at this Florida Panhandle base by the end of 1997 as part of military budget cutting.<ep>
   The Air Force announced plans to disband the 132-member 87th Electronic Warfare Aggressor Squadron between this October and October of 1997, said Staff Sgt. Carole Inman, a spokeswoman at Eglin.<ep>
   Another 62 military positions will be lost when five of the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron's 19 jet fighters are transferred late this year, she said.<ep>
   The 87th, created only six years ago, travels around the world testing aircraft and crews against electronic threats such as radars and jamming systems. It spent most of its first year helping crews learn how to shut down Iraqi air defenses.<ep>
   Some of its duties will be taken over by Eglin's 16th Test Squadron, which deals with electronic weapons development. When the 87th was formed, it was hailed as a way to cut costs by sending the evaluators to the home bases of combat units instead of having them fly to Eglin.<ep>
   The 85th tests the Air Force's newest bombs, missiles and other weaponry in situations that match real combat. It is losing three F-16 Fighting Falcons and two F-15 Eagles.<ep>
   Both units are part of the Air Force Air Warfare Center, which last year transferred its headquarters from Eglin to Nellis Air Force Base, Nev.<ep>
   Base officials said no other reductions are anticipated at Eglin during the coming year.<ep>
   The new cuts are separate from a decision last year by the Base Closure and Realignment Commission to transfer 10 mobile electronic warfare simulators and 50 related civilian jobs from Eglin to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.<ep>
