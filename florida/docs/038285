<m0>   SEATTLE (--) One down, four to go. That's the count at the Ballard Locks after a fish-munching sea lion, one of five targeted for relocation to Florida, was caught this week.<ep>
   The 636-pound sea lion, known as No. 225, was moved to a holding pen at the Point Defiance Zoo in Tacoma (--) separated by a chain-link fence from a baby polar bear adopted last year after it was found wandering motherless around Barrow, Alaska.<ep>
   Tacoma is a temporary stop for the sea lion, whose new home will be at Sea World in Orlando.<ep>
   He'll be held there ``till we capture one or two other sea lions or until Sea World is convinced we're not going to capture any more animals,'' said Brian Gorman, spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service here.<ep>
   It will save time and money for the Florida operation to take as many sea lions as possible at one time, he noted.<ep>
   Earlier this year, after a change in the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the state got federal permission to kill the five most voracious of the bewhiskered behemoths that gobble steelhead migrating through the locks and delight tourists with somersaults and other water play.<ep>
   The plan, approved after years of unsuccessful attempts to deter the animals with firecrackers, rubber bullets and air horns, drew an outcry from environmental groups, who blame the man-made locks for the problem.<ep>
   In April, Sea World volunteered to provide a home for the errant sea lions in Orlando.<ep>
   The Humane Society of the United States, based in Washington, D.C., said Tuesday neither Washington state nor the federal agency has the authority to send the animal to Sea World.<ep>
   That group and several other environmental organizations filed suit to prevent any sea lions from being killed.<ep>
   Naomi Rose, a Humane Society marine mammal scientist, suggested the state simply hold the sea lion at Point Defiance until the end of the steelhead season later this month and then release him.<ep>
   For weeks, there was no sign of any of the animals considered primary offenders (--) Nos. 41, 45, 87, 225 and 17, also known as ``Hondo.''<ep>
   Authorities put fencing around navigational buoys near a large, floating cage anchored in the water, to make the cage the most accessible and enticing spot for sea lions to rest or sun themselves.<ep>
   On Monday, No. 225 was in the cage.<ep>
   Steelhead on their way to freshwater spawning streams stop passing through the locks in May and in June, the sea lions migrate to California to breed.<ep>
   But some of the targeted animals have been seen at the locks year round, Gorman said, noting that in early summer, they can catch outbound juvenile steelhead and salmon headed for the ocean, where they mature.<ep>
   ``Some sea lions hang out at the dock just to eat those juveniles,'' he said.<ep>
   Hondo has not been seen since March, Gorman said, speculating that the animal may have died. While not dismissing the possibility that Hondo may have been shot, he said bachelor male sea lions have a stressful existence and usually live only 10 or 12 years.<ep>
   Hondo's first contact with authorities came in March 1989, when he was captured and weighed in at 400 pounds. In March 1990, he weighed 650 pounds, Gorman said.<ep>
   When he was captured in January 1995, he weighed 870 pounds. After five months in state custody, he was released in June weighing 1,087 pounds, the heaviest sea lion on record here.<ep>
   ``This guy was eating regularly,'' Gorman said.<ep>
