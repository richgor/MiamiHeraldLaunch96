<m0>   TALLAHASSEE (--) A majority vote wouldn't be enough to add taxes to the state Constitution under a proposal the Florida Supreme Court agreed Thursday could go on the 1996 ballot.<ep>
   Voters will be asked to require two-thirds approval for constitutional amendments changing taxes and fees. The measure itself would need a simple majority.<ep>
   ``This is a pretty good day,'' said David Biddulph of New Smyrna Beach, who leads the group that sponsored the citizen's initiative.<ep>
   Although taxes and fees generally aren't put in the Constitution, efforts are under way for the second time in recent years to insert a sugar tax to pay for Everglades restoration.<ep>
   The title of the anti-tax measure is ``Tax Limitation: Should Two-Thirds Vote Be Required for New Constitutionally Imposed State Taxes/Fees?''<ep>
   In a unanimous unsigned ruling, Florida's high court said the proposed amendment was clearly explained by its ballot title and summary (--) the final hurdle to get on the ballot.<ep>
   The Tax Cap Committee, which has pushed the citizen's initiative, has collected the necessary 429,428 signatures to go before voters.<ep>
   Although no justice dissented, Justice Ben Overton expressed some reservations in a concurring opinion.<ql>
<m0>Understanding paramount<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   ``I believe the public should understand that this provision would prevent a majority of the electorate of this state from changing the tax structure now contained in our Constitution,'' Overton wrote.<ep>
   Voters couldn't decide to increase taxes on the rich or provide tax relief to the middle class and poor without a two-thirds vote, he noted.<ep>
   It would take a super-majority to place a fee on the sugar industry to pay for Everglades protection or impose a limited income tax in exchange for reducing property and sales taxes, Overton added.<ep>
   Biddulph believes the measure would make it harder for income-tax supporters to reverse a constitutional ban on the tax. ``Many people believe we should have a state income tax, and we believe this will provide a fire wall against that notion.''<ep>
   Justice Harry Lee Anstead concurred with Overton's opinion. Chief Justice Stephen Grimes recused himself from the case.<ep>
   Florida's high court rejected the initiative in October 1994, when it ruled the measure could not go on the ballot because it dealt with more than one subject.<ep>
   A month later, voters changed the state Constitution so the single-subject limitation no longer applies to citizen initiatives dealing with taxes or fees.<ep>
   That change also was pushed by the Tax Cap Committee, which is promoting a proposal to require voter approval of all new taxes and a property rights measure as well.<ql>
<m0>Protecting minorities<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Biddulph said the super-majority requirement is designed to protect minority groups, such as smokers or a particular industry, from being targeted for tax increases.<ep>
   ``We think that this makes it a much more deliberative decision before we would impose new taxes or fees by constitutional amendment,'' he said. ``We think it's the way to go.''<ep>
   Two years ago, a group started pushing a proposed amendment that would have levied a tax on sugar to pay for Everglades cleanup, but was kept from the ballot by the high court.<ep>
   Eva Armstrong, government relations director of Audubon Society in Florida, said her group questioned the wisdom of the two-thirds rule. Common Cause and 1000 Friends of Florida have filed objections.<ql>
