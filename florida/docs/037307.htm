    FORT PIERCE -- Prison road gangs wear old-fashioned uniforms, horizontally striped with black and white bars. Humiliating? ``You bet it is,'' the sheriff said.<P>

   Prisoners pay $1.20 a day for food, $10 to see a doctor. Soon they'll live in tents. Pitiless? ``Too bad,'' the sheriff said. ``We save a lot of money.''<P>

   Jail house TV sets offer only religious, motivational and educational programs. Inhospitable? ``I don't think they're entitled to TV at all,'' the sheriff said.<P>

   R.C. ``Bobby'' Knowles, the hard-eyed sheriff of St. Lucie County, believes in hard time. Politically astute, he espouses the quaint notion that prisoners should be punished, not merely incarcerated.<P>

   What we do not have here is a failure to communicate.<P>

   ``We want to make jail a place you don't want to come back to,'' said Knowles, 55. ``Make it hard, make it uncomfortable. Make it fair and clean and consistent with the rights of human beings, but jail is supposed to be a bad place to go.''<P>

   Borrowing a concept from Broward County -- a concept blocked eight years ago by a federal judge -- the St. Lucie County Commission last week authorized Knowles to build tents for overflow prisoners.<P>

   The canvas surplus Army tents should be ready by summer. They will not be air-conditioned. A sign outside a model tent within sight of Knowles' office: ``Vacancy. Coming Soon -- Affordable Inmate Housing.''<P>

   Said the sheriff, who served as a Marine sergeant in Vietnam:<P>

   ``If it's good enough for American troops, if it's good enough for people who lost their homes in Hurricane Andrew, it's good enough for someone who's committed a crime.''<P>

   Knowles' methods are simultaneously old-fashioned and innovative. And they reflect a growing trend, as taxpayers tire of what they perceive as indulgent treatment of prisoners:<P>

   In North Florida, jailers pack up weight-training machines. In the Deep South, chain gangs suddenly reappear. In Arizona, a sheriff pitches tents for 1,500 inmates, feeds them bologna sandwiches, makes them wear pink underwear and grins when people call him ``the meanest sheriff in America.''<P>

   Knowles, in office since 1985, faces tough opposition in this fall's Republican primary from an ex-FBI agent. For Knowles and many other politicians, hard time is an easy sell.<P>

   Maybe too easy, according to some experts.<P>

Professor disagrees<BR>
   ``Basically, he's trying to pander to the lowest common denominator, people who don't really think very much but simply want to hurt people who have hurt them,'' said Paul Cromwell, a University of Miami professor of criminology and sociology.<P>

   He said research shows that repeat offenders rarely consider the consequences of their actions. So, he said, restricted TV programs and striped uniforms have little or no lasting effect.<P>

   Besides, Cromwell said, ``Incarceration itself is the punishment. You don't have to add all these other things.''<P>

   Nonsense, Knowles and his aides say. Common sense dictates that people -- even malevolent people -- will avoid unpleasant experiences.<P>

   Knowles: ``We've spent billions of dollars on rehabilitation, and obviously it hasn't worked. Now it's time to try something else.<P>

   ``The public wants truth in sentencing and the punishment to fit the crime, and that didn't happen for 30 years in our country.''<P>

Selective treatment<BR>
   Most of the sheriff's measures apply only to inmates who have been convicted and sentenced; those awaiting trial or sentencing are treated more conventionally. In addition, some anti-drug, educational and other rehabilitative programs are conducted at his prison.<P>

   The variables that govern crime statistics complicate assessments of Knowles' program, but he said major crime declined by 7 percent last year in the unincorporated area that is his prime responsibility.<P>

   ``Inmates are learning that if they want to commit a crime, they should do it somewhere other than St. Lucie County,'' said Mark Weinberg, a spokesman for the sheriff's department.<P>

   Incentives for moving on down the road:<P>

   <LI> For the last six months, inmates assigned to work crews have been required to wear striped uniforms reminiscent of those employed years ago in prison -- and in countless prison movies.<P>

   Some inmates complain that passing motorists shout insults and obscenities at them; others take the stripes in stride.<P>

   ``It doesn't bother me,'' said Arthur Rodgers, 27, of Fort Pierce, sentenced to nine months for public intoxication and found working last week on a litter crew. ``I did my crime, and it's part of my punishment.<P>

   ``The sheriff said, `Once you come to my jail, you won't want to come back.' It's true. I don't want to come back here.''<P>

   Inmates in Dade and Broward perform similar work, but wear less distinctive uniforms.<P>

   ``I don't know of any research to support the notion that prisoners who are humiliated don't return to crime,'' Broward Corrections director Susan McCampbell said.<P>

   <LI> Last May, Knowles began imposing ``co-payments'' on inmates who need or seek medical care. Each visit to a nurse costs $5, to a doctor or dentist $10. Prescriptions cost $5 each.<P>

   Then, two months ago, jailers started charging inmates for their meals. The $1.20 daily fee is about half the county's cost, Weinberg said.<P>

   ``Each of us pays for his own meals,'' he said. ``If we get thrown in jail, the taxpayer has to pay for our food? That doesn't make sense.''<P>

   Deductions come from each inmate's canteen account. If a prisoner's account is empty, jailers still provide food and medical services -- but maintain a running tally of the amount owed.<P>

   ``If they ever visit us again, we try to deduct it from their account then,'' Weinberg said.<P>

   Jail officials in Dade do not charge inmates for food or health care, though the Dade County Commission has authorized jailers to recover some medical costs from inmates. Janelle Hall, a spokeswoman for Metro-Dade Corrections, said the department is working on a plan to do so.<P>

   Broward's corrections department began charging inmates for some health services last July and soon will assess fees for room and board, McCampbell said.<P>

   <LI> Guests of the St. Lucie County Detention Center can watch TV if they like -- as long as they watch the Family Channel, Discovery Channel or public and educational channels. They can forget about NYPD Blue  and Homicide: Life on the Street.<P>

   ``They're not going to see any violence on TV while they're here,'' Knowles said. ``Most are here because they've already committed violence, so why would we show them more?''<P>

   Dade and Broward inmates enjoy a full range of TV programs, though Dade broadcasts special programs about the legal system during the afternoon and hopes to soon funnel educational programs into the Dade County Jail.<P>

   <LI> By far the most controversial action taken by Knowles concerns the use of tents to augment his 768-bed jail.<P>

   He is erecting five 20-by-40-foot tents in a secure area of the detention center. Each will hold about 10 inmates. A guard station and bathrooms will be nearby.<P>

   The cost: $100,000, less than one-tenth the price of a conventional building for the same number of inmates, according to county calculations.<P>

   Utilities will be provided, but not air conditioning. That could be a problem.<P>

   In 1988, a federal judge enjoined then-Broward Sheriff Nick Navarro from housing inmates in tents under Florida's scorching sun. Inmate advocates called the plan inhumane.<P>

   Broward now hopes to shelter overflow inmates in prefabricated, igloo-shaped contraptions that will provide some relief from the heat, McCampbell said.<P>

   Though some legal experts said Knowles is risking court action similar to that seen in Broward, the sheriff seems unconcerned, ever more resolute.<P>

   Coming this summer to St. Lucie County:<P>

   Chain gangs.
