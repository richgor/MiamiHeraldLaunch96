   FORT MYERS -- As ``God'' of the Lords of Chaos, Kevin Foster was a strict taskmaster.<P>

   To become part of his secret club, a teenage boy had to commit a crime to prove his worth -- a serious crime. Robbery, carjacking, arson. <P>

   He had to have the stomach to stand the kind of sights Foster could stand, such as setting fire to an exotic bird aviary just to watch the finely plumed animals burn to death. And he had to go along with even the most extreme schemes, like the one to murder the high school band teacher. <P>

   Foster, 18, a high school dropout, ``has written a new chapter in juvenile crime,'' Lee County Sheriff John McDougall said.<P>

   McDougall said Foster led a band of a dozen teenagers, most still in high school, on a crime spree so violent it has stunned even veteran law enforcement officers. <P>

   ``They certainly lived up to their name,'' McDougall said of the Lords of Chaos. Earlier this month, deputies arrested Foster and five other <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<PRE>LORDS OF CHAOS,  FROM  1A
</PRE>
members of the ``LOC'' -- as their stylized logo reads -- on charges ranging from conspiracy to commit robbery to arson to first-degree murder. <P>

   The boys came from middle-class homes in the Riverdale area of Lee County. It's a semi-rural place, 25 miles from the busy beaches, east of Fort Myers. Sand and coconut palms give way to cattle pastures and scrub pine in Riverdale. None of them have criminal records.<BR>
 <BR>
   They were planning to burn down Riverdale High's auditorium, police say -- they had already torched a historic Coca-Cola bottling plant in Fort Myers, and a Baptist Church in Lehigh Acres -- when band director Mark Schwebes came upon them. He didn't report them, but he confiscated cans of peaches they were going to use to break the windows so they could toss Molotov cocktails inside, police say.<BR>
   For that action, Foster ordered Schwebes' death, informants told police. The same night, April 30, Derek Shields, 18, a band member with a $20,000 scholarship to the University of Florida, knocked on Schwebes' door.<P>

   When the 32-year-old teacher answered, Foster stepped up with a shotgun and fired in Schwebes' face, police say. They say he then shot Schwebes in the buttocks to make a statement -- he suspected Schwebes was gay, and the Lords of Chaos hated homosexuals.<BR>
<P>

   Charged with Foster are: Shields; Christopher Black, 18; Peter Magnotti, 17; Christopher Burnett, 17; and Thomas Torrone, 16. <P>

   McDougall and his officers are puzzling over the central question behind the Lords of Chaos devised -- why did they do it? <P>

   One thing they know: It all started and ended with Foster, addressed as ``God'' by the other members. <P>

   Behind the tough, gun-toting image of the boy who liked to pose like Rambo with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle is a young man so insecure he threatened to kill himself when his girlfriend left him. The same man who police said led the murderous gang was so inept with a gun that he once shot himself. <P>

   ``God,'' his friends say, had a weak ego and a chip on his shoulder -- he thought he was inferior to everybody else. He manipulated friends and family, they say, by threatening to hurt himself. <P>

   He had an extreme fondness for guns -- detectives have seized 30 guns from the Lords of Chaos, most of them from Foster's home. One is a sawed-off shotgun, another has a silencer on it.<P>

   He had easy access to the weapons, because his stepfather of 10 years, John Foster, owns Riverdale Gold and Pawn and was a gun dealer. He put up a good face to his elders. Some neighbors called him ``Opie with a gun.'' Others told the Fort Myers News-Press that he was polite, and impressed adults with his manners and mature conversation. <P>

   But close friends and family gave police more insight into the mind of the founder of the Lords of Chaos. Two years ago, Foster shot himself in the stomach with a .45 caliber Colt revolver. It was an accident, he said.<P>

   First, he claimed it happened while he was sitting on his bed cleaning the gun. But when police told him they found no gun cleaning materials in the bedroom, he said the gun went off when he was ``sort of twirling it.'' Foster told nurses at the hospital that his best friend was dying of leukemia and that's why he was depressed. <P>

   The bullet passed through his abdomen -- missing vital organs -- and came out his left buttock. <P>

   Julie Stevens, his girlfriend at the time, said Foster ``was always down on himself.'' <P>

   ``He was just saying that he thinks that everybody is better than he is,'' Stevens told police.<P>

   It was during a phone call with Stevens that Foster shot himself March 6, 1994. She had placed Foster on hold while she took a call from another boy, Foster's best friend, who had once asked her out on a date. <P>

   Stevens said Foster was upset at that. ``He was just really mad, he said that he was going to hurt himself,'' she told investigator James Allan. ``He had no reason to be here, because nobody cares. I told him I cared, and I went out with him again.'' <P>

   Foster made the same threat eight months earlier, when another girlfriend left him, his mother told Allan. Stevens summed up Foster with this statement: ``He was just always messing with guns.'' <P>

   In Foster's bedroom, investigators found a typical teenage mess. Dirty clothes were strewn on the floor, a bottle of contact lens solution and a container of acne medicine mixed in with them.<P>

   The book Brian's Song was also on the floor, and a thriller by Steven King was on the dresser. A rebel flag hung from the ceiling.<P>

   But this boy's room had something most don't -- guns and ammo, lots of both. Cigar boxes filled with live rounds were on the dresser and in the closet. <P>

   Loose bullets littered the floor. One revolver was on the night stand, another on the floor. A shotgun was propped against the wall in the closet.<BR>
 <BR>
<P>

   In the living room of the Foster home hangs a picture of Kevin as a young boy. He's in a cowboy outfit. Foster worked for Terry Weber at Ken Bunting Carpentry in Fort Myers for the past two years. The teen was always on time, and didn't call in sick, Weber said -- not even the three days between the time police say he killed band leader Schwebes and his arrest May 4.<BR>
 <P>

   ``He was friendly and reliable,'' Weber said. ``He was skilled. He did well here, because he was very responsible.''    Foster was taking drafting classes, Weber said. He had dropped out of high school his sophomore year, after his straight-A grades dropped to Fs -- at the time his girlfriend left him. He later earned a GED. <P>

   Weber said he never saw Foster with a gun, and would never have guessed how gun-happy the teen was.<P>

 ``He was an exceptional employee,'' Weber said.<P>

   McDougall said he is glad of only one thing -- police stopped the gang before they pulled off their grandest and goriest scheme. The Lords of Chaos were planning to go to graduation night at Disney World last week, McDougall said. <P>

   The outlandish plot was to beat up costumed characters, steal the costumes, then open fire in the park, targeting blacks, an informant told investigators. <P>

   What makes kids go so wrong, so young?<P>

   Sheriff's Major David Bonsall doesn't know. He watched the interrogation of some of the gang members. To him, they seemed ``empty.''<P>

   ``Some people are just evil,'' Bonsall said. ``There's no explaining evil.''
