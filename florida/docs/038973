<m0>   PENSACOLA (--) (AP) (--) Scarred by burns when her dress caught fire at age 4, Virginia Minnich retreated onto the laboratory to keep out of public view and emerged a pioneer in hematology, the study of blood.<ep>
   She was 86 when she died of ovarian cancer in Pensacola, where she lived since 1987. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Minnich discovered a link between the eating of dirt by poor or primitive people and iron deficiencies. She was a specialist in the study of bone marrow and blood cell identification, and established hematology clinics from Havana to Thailand.<ep>
   A native of Zanesville, Ohio, she entered Ohio State University to study home economics, but instructors steered her away from the field, said her sister, Eleanor Addis of Pensacola.<ep>
   ``They told her she wouldn't be a good home demonstrations agent because of her scars'' from her waist to her eyes, her sister said.<ep>
   Instead, she entered the world of research and became a professor of hematology at Washington University in St. Louis.<ep>
   Minnich died April 26. She was cremated, and a memorial service was set for Saturday at Perdido Bay United Methodist Church.<m1><ep>
<m0>   Survivors include her husband, Jerry Hajek of Pensacola; two other sisters, Mary Milsted and Esther Dietz, both of Zanesville; and a brother, John Minnich of Indianapolis.<ql>
