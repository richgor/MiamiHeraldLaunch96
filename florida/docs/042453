<m0>   A surfer from Mount Dora became the season's first shark-bite victim.<ep>
   Jimmy Grunewald, 27, was surfing in Shark Shallows off Ponce Inlet when he was nipped by a two- to three-foot shark.<ep>
   ``It was a pretty good bite,'' said Joe Wooden, deputy chief of the Volusia County Beach Department. The skin on the surfer's left foot and leg was mangled and it took 24 stitches to close the wound.<ep>
   There was no bone or nerve damage, Wooden said.<ep>
   The attack happened just after 11 a.m. Tuesday, Wooden said. Grunewald was able to stem the bleeding and drive himself to Fish Memorial Hospital in New Smyrna Beach, Wooden said. He was being treated there Tuesday afternoon and was expected to be released.<ep>
   ``This is the time of year when large numbers of bait fish have moved into the warmer waters closer to the beach,'' Wooden said. ``They are being followed by juvenile sharks. The juveniles are not good hunters yet. They get into the surf line, get disoriented and chomp down on anything that moves.''<ep>
   The shark grabbed Grunewald, tugged a bit, then let go, taking only one bite, Wooden said.<ep>
   ``It grabbed, shook a little bit and let go, thank God,'' Grunewald told WFTV, Channel 0 in Orlando.<ep>
   Told that he was first of the year, he laughed, ``Do I win something for that? Is there a Cadillac outside for me?''<ep>
   The shark may have been a black tip shark or a spinner, probably no more than a few months old, added George Burgess, a shark expert.<ep>
   Tuesday's biting was the first attack reported this year, said Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History at Gainesville.<ep>
   Last year there were 62 confirmed shark attacks worldwide, 11 of which were fatal. There were 29 attacks in Florida, none fatal, Burgess said.<ep>
   The registry does not include as a fatal attack the disappearance of a diver in the Keys last summer.<ep>
   The diver, William Covert, vanished off the Upper Keys while gathering tropical fish in September.<ep>
   After finding some of Covert's ripped clothes and a nylon dive belt missing a half-moon-shaped chunk, detectives consulted with shark experts and concluded that an 11-foot bull shark had attacked him.<ep>
   Dive operators and tourism promoters doubted the story, as did several shark experts, but the 25-year-old graduate student has not been heard from since.<ep>
   Burgess said there is insufficient evidence to warrant adding the diver to the list of attacks.<ql>
