<m0>   In the past three years, the staff at the Cauley Square Tea Room has endured some tough times. They lost their jobs after Hurricane Andrew destroyed the quaint, romantic restaurant. Many lost their homes, forcing them to move or rebuild.<ep>
   But now, they're on a winning streak.<ep>
   In October, they reopened the restaurant. Last week, they won $10.4 million in the lottery.<ep>
   Six employees and the owner of the restaurant at the Cauley Square historic district in Goulds had one of the three winning tickets in the April 20 drawing of the Florida Lottery. They will share one-third of the $31.08 million jackpot, and receive 20 annual installments of $518,000 (--) $74,000 each a year.<ep>
   ``I've been a nervous wreck,'' said Brigitta Hewitt, a part-time cook who prepares delicate <m1> <m0>desserts at the Tea Room. <ep>
   Since the restaurant reopened in October, the seven would each put in $1 and buy seven tickets each week. This was the first time they hit it big. <ep>
   Hewitt drove to Tallahassee with her husband George on Thursday to turn in the winning ticket. To be on the safe side, she placed the ticket in a small plastic bag and pinned it on her bra strap.<ep>
``I didn't want her to sweat the numbers off,'' said Martha Wade, who provided the plastic bag. Wade, the restaurant owner, will share the prize, too.<ep>
   Most of the winners worked at the Tea Room before Hurricane Andrew destroyed it. It took Wade more than three years to be able to reopen and rehire her staff. ``We have a camaraderie here. It's like a family,'' she said.<ep>
   Winning the lottery was an answer to Wade's prayers: ``We lost everything to the storm, and we didn't have insurance at the time. This comes in very handy.''<ep>
    Hewitt, who regularly watches the Saturday night lottery drawings, was the first in the pool to learn the news. She woke her husband to tell him.<ep>
   ``He used to say we'd get struck by lightning before we won the lottery,'' she said. ``I said: `Get up! Get up! We just won the big one. We got struck by lightning.' ''<ep>
   The other winners include waitress Inge Chaney, another waitress, another cook and a waitress helper (--) all who did not want to be identified (--) and the restaurant's former dishwasher, 71 (--) who retired as fast as Wade could replace him and bought a Lincoln Towncar.<ep>
   None of the remaining five employees expects to leave their jobs in the near future.<ep>
   ``We like it here,'' Hewitt said. ``It's a nice place to work, and we're all friends.''<ql>
