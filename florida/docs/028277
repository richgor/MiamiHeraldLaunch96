<m0>   From a journalist's view, life is always stranger than fiction. In the case of <m0>My Son Is Innocent, <m0>an ABC film based on the saga of Todd Neely of Stuart, the real story, which happened 10 years ago, was much more compelling.<ep>
   I covered the four-year fight against a <m4>Neely<m2><ql>
<m0>wrongful conviction (--) the police bungling, the pig-headed prosecution and the law-and-order judge who discounted a time-stamped American Express dinner check that showed Neely and his mother were 11.3 miles from the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.<ep>
   After a faulty eyewitness identification, Neely, then 18, went to jail for attempted murder and attempted rape.<ep>
  The movie, which airs at <m1> <m0>9 tonight on Channel 10, deletes the juicy details and ignores the insider politicking that corrected a malfunction of justice.<ep>
   To be fair, it accurately captures the struggle of Neely's mother, Edith Crosley, to uncover the real culprit, as well as the work of the Martin County legal establishment.<ep>
   But no mention is made of the labor of Martin Dardis, the <m0>pro bono <m0>private investigator, nor his behind-the-scenes lobbying with Deputy Florida Attorney General Jim York and staffer John Hogan, now U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno's chief of staff in Washington.<ep>
   Weird details such as defense investigator Jim Humphries' surreptitious interview with the crime victim (--) while flying her over Stuart in his private aircraft (--) were left out.<ep>
Polygraph expert Warren Holmes' prying interrogation of young Neely got scratched, as did my stumbling search for the real suspect in the seedy trailer parks of west Palm Beach County.<ep>
   The fate of former Assistant State Attorney Peter Neil, now an insurance lawyer in Alabama, and lead detective Steele Ritter, demoted after leaving part of a human head in a Dumpster behind a crime scene, also ended up on the cutting-room floor. <ep>
   The movie is set in Fairview, Ariz., and the names were changed; possibly to protect the producers from lawsuits. Edith, dubbed Maggy Sutter, is played by Marilu Henner, best known as Burt Reynolds' wife in the old <m0>Evening Shade  <m0>television series.<ep>
   Neely's character, Eric Sutter, is well done by actor Nick Stahl, balancing Neely's frustrating nonchalance with sympathy for a typical if troublesome adolescent. He even looks like the real Todd Neely (--) who went to jail for 92 days in 1987 before being released on appeal.<ep>
    A perky Lewis Crosley, Edith's second husband and the grandson of the flamboyant former Cincinnati Reds owner Al Crosley Jr., is also true to life.<ep>
<m0>   <m0>Screenwriters had to tell the tale in 90 minutes. The real story was more dramatic. Judge C. Pfeiffer Trowbridge, who occasionally wore a gun under his robes, convicted Neely on the basis of the eyewitness testimony of Linda Zavatkay, a young Pratt & Whitney engineering assistant. Taking pain pills at the time, she initially identified her assailant as ``a boy with braces.''<ep>
   Neely never wore braces. Sheriff's detective Ritter zeroed in on Neely when a neighbor told him about an unruly boy in the townhouse complex. Ritter ran the tag number of Todd's car, then called his own high school-age son. Neely, it turned out, had once stuck the Ritter boy's head in a toilet during a scuffle at school.<ep>
   What came out later was that other neighbors (--) whose interviews with the police were <m1> <m0>never divulged to the defense (--) had complained for months about a 14-year-old boy in the neighborhood who peeked in windows, exposed himself in public and, yes, wore braces.<ep>
   Deli owners John and Kathy Talliere, who complained repeatedly about the boy, joined the Crosleys' public fight after reading of the conviction.<ep>
   The Herald-Dardis investigation found that the boy had once pulled a knife on a neighborhood girl while drunk at a party. Dardis - the former Dade state attorney investigator who first linked the Watergate burglary to the Committee To Reelect President Nixon (--) persuaded then state Attorney General Bob Butterworth's office to order an investigation.<ep>
  Dardis recalled his meeting with York and Hogan in Fort Lauderdale. <ep>
   ``They told me, `We have to play the devil's advocate, but you've convinced us the kid is innocent and it was impossible for him to have done it.' '' <ep>
   After a 400-page report from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, a new judge overturned the verdict. Refusing to give up, District Attorney Bruce Colton appealed.<ep>
   When the Fourth District panel found that the state had purposefully withheld evidence, the state attorney's office finally dropped the charges.<ep>
   Hollywood's version is much neater. A ``Daily Herald'' reporter locates the boy with braces in a boarding school, and Edith/Maggy and Todd/Eric talk their way into the school to take a picture of the boy. When Edith/Maggy shows the photo to Zavatkay's character, the witness recants in tears.<ep>
   In real life, Linda Zavatkay never changed her testimony. Relatives of the boy with braces, Dennis John Raether Jr., sent him to exile in Oregon. Raether's relatives admitted later that they owned a distinctive knife found at the crime scene (--) a matter omitted in the TV version.<ep>
   Neely is now 28, and living in Orlando, where he is studying political science at the University of Central Florida. He has been back to Stuart only once in recent years, just last week, to visit a friend.<ep>
   Edith and Lew Crosley retired in Sarasota. The Crosleys received $157,000 in compensation from the state of Florida, $75,000 of which went to attorneys. Movie rights gave the family $50,000. Neely got $185,000 in out-of-court settlements from the Martin County Sheriff's Office and the Treasure Coast State Attorney's Office.<ep>
   Colton is up for re-election this year. He is expected to run unopposed.<ep>
