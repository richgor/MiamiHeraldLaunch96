<m0>   TALLAHASSEE (--) Florida is better known for the Everglades, North America's only living coral reef and miles of beaches, but it also has cacti. And the most endangered species is under serious threat from a foreign moth.<ep>
   Scientists know of only 13 semaphore cacti in the wild. Those plants could be ravaged by the larvae or caterpillars of the Cactoblastis moth, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission warned in a release issued Wednesday.<ep>
   The semaphore cactus, which exist in the Keys, is one of six species of prickly pears native to Florida.<ep>
   ``This moth can ravage populations of cacti,'' said Doria Gordon, an ecologist for the Florida Chapter of the Nature Conservancy. ``The semaphore cactus may be one of the rarest plants in the world, and this moth has the potential to make Florida's other native cacti rare, too.''<ep>
   Phil Frank, a commission researcher, said the potential for the semaphore cactus to be wiped out in the wild is pretty high.<ep>
   ``To counter that, we need to maintain as many geographical locations as possible,'' he said. ``We can't want to have all our eggs in one basket. We need them separated because of the threat from this moth.''<ep>
   To protect the semaphore cacti, environmentalists from The Nature Conservancy have enclosed about half of them in screened enclosures. They have sent tissue samples to botanical gardens to propagate new cacti and create a supply in case the wild ones are wiped out.<ep>
   ``These insects are going to be extremely difficult to eradicate,'' said Randy Tate, land steward for The Nature Conservancy in the Keys. ``So it's up to the conservation community to take all the measures to perpetuate these cacti.''<ep>
   Scientists believe the moths either arrived in Florida naturally or on shipments of prickly pears from the Caribbean during the late 1980s.<ep>
   The moths have been spotted from the Keys, up the west coast to Tampa Bay and up the East Coast to Brevard County.<ep>
   Researchers from the University of South Florida in Tampa have studied the damage caused by the moths but have no estimate on the percentage that have been damaged or destroyed.<ep>
