<m0>    Rescue workers used airboats to get to the remote, swampy site, then slogged through thigh-deep muck Wednesday to get to the bodies of three people killed in a seaplane crash west of Melbourne.<ep>
    Killed in the Tuesday crash were Michael Demchack, 59, a well-known flight instructor at Florida Technological Institute, and Alistair Graham, 27, a former student. Also killed was an unidentified friend of Graham's, authorities said late Wednesday.<ep>
    The area, on the western shore of Lake Washington, was so difficult to reach that FTU called in a salvage helicopter to remove the airplane piece by piece.<ep>
    National Transportation Safety Board investigator Preston Hicks said it will be weeks before technicians sort out what may have happened, but he said the plane's wingtip hit the top of the only tall tree in the area about 75 yards from where it crashed.<ep>
    When the plane hit, it flipped over, submerging the cockpit in about four feet of water and mud.<ep>
    The plane, a Lake Buccaneer, has one engine and is set up with pontoons so it can land in water. Whether the plane was trying to land was unclear, Hicks said.<ep>
    People aboard a second Florida Tech plane, in the air at the time of the crash, apparently saw the seaplane go down at 7:02 p.m., officials said.<ep>
    The plane was rented and was not a school instructional flight, school officials said. Both Demchack and Graham were certified to fly the plane.<ql>
