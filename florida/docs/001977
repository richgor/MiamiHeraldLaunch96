<m0>   PUNTA GORDA (--) This one monkey just about stopped the show (--) for a while at least (--) at the Burger King east of here.<ep>
   Shortly before lunchtime, the monkey was spotted outside the fast food restaurant. The 30-pound stump-tailed macaque had escaped from its cage at the Keesling ranch (--) right next door to the Burger King, Charlotte County Sheriff's Sgt. Randy Crowl says.<ep>
   The ranch's owners were on vacation, and ranch hands were caring for the animals when the monkey got away.<ep>
   Over at the Burger King, off-duty Deputy Chris Pifer called in to report what looked like a baboon on the loose. Other deputies joined up, chasing the monkey back toward the ranch.<ep>
   ``He got up on buildings and was swinging from trees and doing things that monkeys do. We just eye-balled him until the pros got there,'' Crowl said.<ep>
   The monkey then led its pursuers on a nearly three-hour chase through neighboring fields. <m1> <m0>Charlotte County Animal Control Director Keith Larson finally managed to get the loop of his capture stick around the animal.<ep>
   ``It wasn't one of the easier jobs we've done,'' Larson said. ``He was fast and a lot better at climbing over fences than me.''<ep>
   The reason for the escape was evident at the monkey's cage, said Lt. Steve DeLacure of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.<ep>
   Acidity in the macaque's urine appeared to have weakened a section of the wire cage, permitting the monkey to bend the bars to make a hole large enough to slip right through.<ep>
   The macaque, DeLacure said, was returned to the ranch, which on Tuesday passed inspection.<ep>
   Looking back on all the monkey business, Crowl, said the simian simply ``had a hankering for a Whopper.''<ep>
