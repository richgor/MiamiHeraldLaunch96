   PENSACOLA -- Anna Smith said Tuesday she will turn down a precedent-setting offer of relocation from her dioxin-contaminated neighborhood unless residents of surrounding communities also are moved.<P>

   The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed moving 66 households most directly affected by a toxic waste site known as ``Mount Dioxin.'' Additional studies will be conducted, however, before it is decided whether to relocate nearly 300 more families.<P>

   ``We are going to hang together or we are going to die together,'' Smith said although she added, ``Hell can't be any worse than this.''<P>

   Citizens Against Toxic Exposure, a community group pushing for a wider relocation, has urged residents of the predominantly black neighborhoods to take an all-or-none stand.<P>

   CATE has been seeking a full-scale relocation for nearly four years and contends the agency's reluctance is an example of environmental racism, which EPA officials deny.<P>

   They say what CATE wants has never been done before and could set an expensive precedent for the federal government's Superfund cleanup sites.<P>

   The group will ask EPA to delay a public hearing on the relocation plan from May 16 until June 14 to give it more time to build its case, said CATE president Margaret Williams.<P>

   Mount Dioxin got its name from EPA's excavation of contaminated soil left at the abandoned Escambia Wood Treating Co. plant to halt contamination of groundwater.<P>

   EPA has yet to decide what to do with the soil laced with dioxin and other toxic substances, which remains piled at the site, standing nearly 60 feet high and covered by gray plastic sheeting.<P>

   Escambia is the most seriously contaminated of two Superfund sites within a half-mile of each other in the heart of Pensacola. The other is a former Agrico Co. fertilizer plant in the midst of being cleaned up.<P>

   Nearby residents have blamed the toxic sites for causing rashes, cancer, respiratory problems and other ailments and deaths, but EPA officials say their claims are unproven.<P>

   Smith, 79, keeps her windows shut to block out contaminants from the Escambia site less than a block from her home. She blames it for the death of her husband, Curtis Smith, from cancer and kidney failure.<P>

   The plan sets precedents because it is based on a lower dioxin level than used in most Superfund relocations and includes homes with lesser levels that may be endangered by cleanup efforts, said EPA project manager Mark Fite.<P>

   Dioxin exceeds the new threshold in yards of about 20 homes, but the agency has agreed to relocate everyone in the Rosewood Terrace neighborhood at an estimated cost of $4.8 million. Relocating all 350 area households would cost about $23 million.<P>

   The plan includes further evaluation of how the sites affect the welfare of the other residents. It would involve such factors as aesthetics, recreational uses and economic impact, including the loss of property value.<P>

   Considering welfare is another precedent, Fite said. Previous relocations have been based strictly on health and safety or were ordered by Congress.<P>

   A third element of the plan is to seek help from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, local governments and private agencies in finding other ways residents could be relocated.<P>

   Fite said a number of residents told him they want to move, and he pointed out it will be up to each household to accept or reject the offer.<P>

   ``We don't have to make everybody happy, so we are not held hostage by public opinion,'' he said. ``We may choose to proceed with this plan even if we do get objections.''<P>

   The EPA's own National Environmental Justice Advisory Council, which is helping the agency develop a national relocation plan, may be among the objectors.<P>

   The council met in Pensacola last week with residents. Its chairman, Charles Lee, research director for the United Church of Christ Mission for Racial Justice in New York City, promised to take their case all the way to the White House, said CATE president Williams.
