   For example, there is the annual Gasparilla Festival in Tampa just before Lent, celebrating Jose Gaspar, a legendary pirate who some think never existed. Then there is the Billy Bowlegs (the pirate not the Seminole) festival in Fort Walton Beach at the end of this month. And, on June 1, the good citizens of St. Augustine will re-enact English corsair Sir Francis Drake's attack on the city. (Corsair is a fancy word for pirate.)<P>

   The pirate Billy Bowlegs perhaps never actually came to Florida, but several places, Fort Walton Beach included, have made a good thing out of celebrating his colorful and bloody career.<P>

   Drake launched his attack on St. Augustine in 1586. He had 2,000 men, 23 warships and 19 auxiliary vessels. Piracy was big business in England, although Elizabeth I denied she approved of such actions by her subjects. The Spanish retreated into their log fort, fired on Drake, then fled at his approach. He sacked the city, taking 2,000 pounds sterling and a dozen brass cannons. As he left, he burned the town and fort.<P>

   In Stuart, people will regale you with the saga of Don Pedro Gilbert, the world's last official pirate, who careened his black schooner Panda in the St. Lucie River while luring unsuspecting ships onto the reef offshore.<P>

   Gilbert was caught by the British navy in Africa, returned to the United States for trial in Boston, convicted and hanged for piracy.<P>

   When the Spanish treasure fleet of 1715 sank along today's Treasure Coast and salvage operations began, privateers -- that's a word for a legal pirate -- sailed down from the British colonies to raid the valuables hauled from the sea by the Spanish and deposited on the beach.<P>

   Up in Fernandina Beach, they will tell you stories of Luis Aury, who arrived there in 1817, raised the flag of the Republic of Mexico and turned the port city into a haven for pirates and cutthroats. He opened the city, nominally in Spanish territory, to the slave trade. The U.S. Marines were brought in, Aury fled and the city was briefly handed back to the Spanish.<P>

   There were lesser pirates who operated out of the little bays and rivers of the Florida peninsula. Most of their names are lost to us today.<P>

   Some of the wreckers, or salvors, who operated along the Florida Keys were little more than pirates. They often lured ships onto reefs or into shallow water just so they could plunder them. Some stories even say wreckers murdered the crews of the hapless ships.<P>

   Pirate legends are everywhere. Some real-estate brokers in earlier days spread stories that pirate treasure was buried on the land they were selling. This scam often worked, and suckers would buy almost any land and start digging with abandon. If anyone ever found anything valuable, they certainly did not make much noise about it.<P>

   What is certain is that no matter how colorful the old pirates may have been, they were a thieving and treacherous lot. They thought little of slitting throats, slaughtering entire crews and some of their own men. They were not, in short, very nice people.<P>

   So, how is it we celebrate pirates during fun-filled festivals? Why do people dress up in pirate garb and careen through the streets in mock raids?<P>

   Maybe it is something psychological. Maybe we like the opportunity to pretend we are daring, dashing, totally amoral people as a way to escape from the realities of some of our modern-day pirates.
