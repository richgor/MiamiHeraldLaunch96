<m0>   PENSACOLA (--) Retired Vice Adm. James B. Stockdale, who won the nation's highest military award for his leadership as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, was among six men enshrined Thursday in the Naval Aviation Hall of Honor.<ep>
   The Medal of Honor winner from Coronado, Calif., was independent presidential candidate Ross Perot's running mate in 1992 but this year is backing the presidential bid of Republican Bob Dole.<ep>
   ``Don't get the idea that we who lived out that war in Hanoi gained nothing to show for it,'' said Stockdale, who endured torture and deprivation as the POWs' underground leader. ``We did not come home empty-handed.''<ep>
   Stockdale, who encouraged resistance among POWs, said they learned that surviving at any cost might be surviving at the cost of a comrade. By supporting each other, they returned with consciences intact, he said.<ep>
   ``So I say, bless you prison, bless you shootdown, bless all the close shaves I've had in the air and all the hairy carrier landings on dark nights and those ready-room memories for having been in my life,'' Stockdale said.<ep>
   He led the first American air strikes against North Vietnam in 1964 and flew 201 missions before he was shot down, becoming the Navy's highest-ranking POW of the Vietnam War.<ep>
   He was held captive in North Vietnam for 7 1/2 years, four of them in solitary confinement, before being released in 1973. He continued in the Navy as a wing commander and president of the Naval War College.<ep>
   The Navy has recognized his legacy of leadership by creating the James Bond Stockdale Leadership Award, presented to two commanding officers each year.<ep>
   The Hall of Honor is part of the National Museum of Naval Aviation at Pensacola Naval Air Station.<ep>
   Three inductees were posthumously enshrined (--) Adm. Forrest P. Sherman, Rear Adm. Joseph C. Clifton and Marine Corps Gen. Christian F. Schilt.<ep>
   Adm. Maurice F. Weisner of Pensacola was the only other new member present. Helicopter manufacturer Charles Kaman of Bloomfield, Conn., was too ill to make the trip.<ep>
   The enshrinement was part of the museum's annual symposium held jointly with the Association of Naval Aviation Convention.<ep>
   The museum also will dedicate an addition that includes a seven-story IMAX theater, display space and a new entrance.<ep>
   Weisner is a former president and chief executive officer of the Naval Aviation Museum Foundation, which has raised millions of dollars to build and expand the museum. His Navy service included sinking a Japanese destroyer-escort and commanding the Pacific Fleet and U.S. Pacific Command.<ep>
   Kaman started Kaman Aircraft Corp. in 1945 when only 26. Kaman produced the first helicopter to perform a loop, the first to use a gas turbine engine and the first to fly by remote control.<ep>
   The airfield at Pensacola Naval Air Station is named for Sherman, who commanded the USS Wasp, then served as deputy chief of staff to Adm. Chester W. Nimitz during World War II and was the youngest officer to serve as chief of naval operations.<ep>
   Schilt won the Medal of Honor for repeatedly flying out wounded and bringing in personnel and medical supplies in Nicaragua in 1928. He retired as director of Marine Corps aviation in 1957.<ep>
   Clifton downed two Japanese planes during World War II and commanded an aircraft carrier division before serving as chief of naval air advanced training and air technical training.<ql>
