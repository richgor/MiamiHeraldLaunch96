   TALLAHASSEE (--) Attorney F. Lee Bailey hopes to prove a former client used Canadian rather than U.S. drug profits to buy stock over which Bailey and the government are wrangling, his attorney said Tuesday.<ep>
   But government attorneys say the national origin of illegal proceeds make no difference.<ep>
   Bailey, who did not appear in court, wants to subpoena prosecution documents to track the disputed $16 million worth of stock.<ep>
   U.S. District Judge Maurice Paul, who had locked Bailey up for 43 days on a contempt charge until he handed the stock over to the court last month, didn't rule on a government motion to quash Robert Zuckerman's subpoenas.<ep>
   The judge also heard arguments on a Bailey motion to delay a May 20 hearing on the stock ownership. Paul didn't say when he would rule on the motions or on a request by Bailey for a jury trial on who owns the stock.<ep>
   For federal authorities to claim the stock, Zuckerman asserted, ``There must be a factual basis to conclude, `Yes, these assets derived from conduct unlawful under the drug laws of the United States.' ''<ep>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David McGee disagreed, saying federal law provides broadly, ``We get the proceeds of his criminal endeavor.''<ep>
   For example, if Bailey's former client, Claude Duboc, took profits from a U.S. drug deal and invested them in a Canadian drug deal, McGee said, ``We get that too.''<ep>
   Bailey, 62, who has defended O.J. Simpson, the Boston Strangler, Patty Hearst and Dr. Sam Sheppard in his 36-year career, was released April 19 after spending more than six weeks in Tallahassee's Federal Detention Center.<ep>
   To get out, he agreed to financial terms committing future income until he has handed over $700,000 to the court and pledging his 74-foot yacht Spellbound as security.<ep>
   Bailey also must report all spending and get written permission from the court for any spending more than $10,000.<ep>
   The stock, now in the court's custody, is 400,000 shares of Biochem Pharma, a Canadian company. It was among assets forfeited by Duboc, a former Bailey client awaiting sentencing before Paul on drug charges.<ep>
   Bailey has said he intends to prove the government transferred the stock to him ``without any restrictions whatsoever'' to pay fees and expenses.<ep>
   McGee said the stock was only entrusted to Bailey to manage some of Duboc's properties in France and accused Bailey of trying to make off with shares that must be returned to the government.<ep>
   Bailey maintains prosecutors showed no interest in the stock until it rose sharply in value. It was valued at about $6 million when turned over to him and is now worth about $16 million. Bailey left prison vowing, ``I'm going to get my money back.''<ep>
   But McGee told the judge that the assets ``rightfully belong to the United States.''<ep>
   ``Every drug-related asset in Mr. Duboc's possession, wherever they were in the world, was to be repatriated to the United States,'' he said. ``It was absolutely crystal clear that all of these items were to be forfeited to the United States.''<ql>
