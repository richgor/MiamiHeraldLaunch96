<m0>   GAINESVILLE (--) Marijuana use has increased dramatically, hallucinogenic drugs are growing in popularity, and cigarette smoking is the highest ever reported among young people, a survey of nearly 200,000 American schoolchildren revealed Monday.<ep>
   ``These findings are alarming and should convince us to focus efforts at middle school prevention and at reinvigorating parents' groups, national education and prevention activities,'' said Mark Gold, a professor of neuroscience, psychiatry, community health and family medicine at the University of Florida medical school, who analyzed the study.<ep>
   Children are much less fearful of illicit drug use or smoking than they were just a few years ago and are using more potent and more dangerous drugs at an increasingly younger age, the study indicated.<ep>
   Students are using tobacco and marijuana more frequently because the drugs are inexpensive, easy to obtain and glamorized in the media. Peer disapproval also is low.<ep>
   The results were based on an annual survey of sixth- through 12th-grade students in 32 states from California to New York. Nearly 200,000 students were polled anonymously on their drug habits and their perceptions of drug use during the 1994-95 school year.<ep>
   The findings reflect similar recent studies of drug use by America's youth.<ep>
   Gold analyzed responses in conjunction with the Atlanta-based Parents Resource Institute for Drug Education, of which he is a board member, and presented his findings Saturday at a meeting of the Society of Biological Psychiatry in New York.<ep>
   One-third of all high school seniors said they smoked marijuana in the past year, and one-fifth smoke at least monthly. Marijuana use increased more dramatically than any other illicit drug.<ep>
   Other recent surveys have shown that daily marijuana use now exceeds daily alcohol use among high school seniors, Gold said.<ep>
   The rate of cigarette smoking among sixth- through 12th-graders also has soared, Gold said.<ep>
   Annual cigarette use reported for middle school and high school students was the highest ever. Nearly one in three sixth- through eighth-graders reported smoking cigarettes annually. And 44 percent of the high school students who responded said they had smoked during the past year, compared with 37 percent in a 1988 sample.<ep>
   For the fourth consecutive year, hallucinogenic drug use increased among students enrolled in grades six through 12. Hallucinogens include LSD, psilocybin, ``Nexus,'' GHB and other drugs such as Rohypnol.<ep>
   The rate of hallucinogenic drug use was four to 23 times greater among students who report carrying a gun to school, taking part in gang activities, thinking of suicide often, threatening to harm another and getting into trouble with police, Gold said.<ep>
   ``A permissive atmosphere, drug availability and '60s nostalgia may be leading a generation of young people naive to today's more potent drugs into the mire of addiction and illicit-drug related illnesses,'' Gold said.<ep>
   The study mirrors a study released last week of 13,000 students by Joseph Califano, former head of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which showed the percentage of eighth-graders using drugs has climbed from 11 to 21 percent since 1991.<ep>
   That study examined the drug-use habits of students who participated in a Youth Risk Behavior Survey over an 18-month period for the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.<ql>
