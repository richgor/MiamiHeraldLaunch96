<m0>  Week three of John Walter Zile's first-degree murder trial ended in controversy Friday, but not before the accused child killer's lawyer may have added another plank to the platform of reasonable doubt he's trying to build for jurors.<ep>
  Defense attorney Craig Wilson got an unexpected boost from Maryland pediatrician, Dr. Dennis Welsh, who came to the courtroom at the behest of prosecutors trying to convict Zile in the September 1994 beating-suffocation murder of his stepdaughter, Christina Holt. But Welsh's testimony may have instead strengthened Zile's defense.<ep>
   Welsh was one of only three witnesses called during a brief session. The trial is expected to end early next week.<ep>
   Welsh said that although Holt did not suffer from epilepsy or any other seizure disorder, she could have developed it at any time (--) and the fact that her mother Pauline Zile suffers from epilepsy is significant ``because I think there can be a congenital history.''<ep>
  As the case nears the end, the centerpiece issue has become this: did Christina choke to death accidentally on her own vomit during a seizure brought on by a spanking; or did she suffocate with Zile's hand over her face to stop her from screaming during a beating?<ep>
  Wilson said he needs to make jurors believe that Christina could indeed have suffered a seizure. The mother-daughter link is essential, Wilson <m1> <m0>said.<ep>
  Prosecutors Scott Cupp and Mary Ann Duggan have been struggling to keep that kind of testimony away from jurors because they don't believe there is a link.<ep>
  Zile has admitted hiding Christina's body in a closet for days before burying her in a shallow hole. Weeks later, Zile and his wife Pauline (--) who has been convicted of first-degree murder (--) launched an elaborate hoax, saying the child had been abducted at the Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop.<ep>
  Both Ziles eventually caved in and confessed, but called the death an accident.<ep>
  Zile is charged with first-degree murder and four counts of aggravated child abuse, including the incident during which Christina died.<ep>
  Jurors will be told that first-degree murder can be premeditated, that Zile meant to kill Christina, or that the death happened during the commission of another felony (--) in this case, aggravated child abuse. In either event the punishment could be the same.<ep>
   But Wilson may have planted enough doubt about epilepsy that jurors may be reluctant to find aggravated child abuse in the events that caused Christina's death.<ep>
   When Wilson asked for a postponement so he could get one more expert witness on epilepsy (--) in response to the prosecution's calling Welsh (--) Circuit Judge Roger Colton refused, prompting heated protests from Wilson and a demand for a mistrial. Colton ignored the complaints and when Wilson refused to declare the defense portion of the case finished, the judge issued a rare ruling closing the case anyway.<ql>
