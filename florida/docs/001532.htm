   LAKELAND -- A 6-year-old Florida girl, infected with HIV at birth, is in line to be the first child in the nation to receive an experimental vaccine to boost the immune system against the deadly AIDS-causing virus.<P>

   Lesley Clementi of Lakeland is an excellent candidate because she is healthy and her immune system is intact, said her doctor, Robert Nelson of All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg.<P>

   ``This is hope for us,'' said Lesley's mother, Tracey Clementi, who tested positive for HIV in 1985 and still shows no symptoms. She was infected by a former husband, who died in 1987. ``I'm just grateful that we have this opportunity because not everyone does.''<P>

   The vaccine, called Immunogen, differs from other AIDS drugs. It strengthens the immune system rather than attacking the virus.<P>

   ``Before it gets too late, we are trying to fight back,'' said Shizuko Sei, an HIV expert in pediatrics at the National Cancer Institute, a component of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.<P>

   Immunogen, which has been tested on adults since 1987, was developed by Jonas Salk, who also developed the polio vaccine.<P>

   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved Immunogen's testing in children based on results of the adult tests, Sei said.<P>

   Ultimately, researchers hope, the vaccine will help the immune system stamp out the HIV.<P>

   Lesley and her mother are going to NIH on May 20 for the first of numerous visits during 18 months. NIH, a federal agency run on tax dollars, is paying for their travel, room and board.<P>

   Clementi, 35, who is separated from her husband and cleans houses for a living, said she would not have been able to provide costly treatment for Lesley on her own.<P>

   Last year, Clementi tired of waiting for the whispers to start and tired of living in fear people would discover she and her daughter were infected with the AIDS-causing virus.<P>

   Before Lesley started kindergarten, the mother began telling friends, relatives, co-workers and school officials.<P>

   ``For years I have asked myself, `What does God want me to do with this?' '' Clementi said. ``I may have found my mission.''<P>

   Her crusade since August has been talking with school employees and parents about AIDS and HIV.<P>

   The Polk County native has been active in educating her community about AIDS so that Lesley, who attends public school and plays in local sports leagues, would not face hostility. Lesley's three siblings do not have the virus.<P>

   Lesley was referred to NIH researchers by her doctor at All Children's Hospital. All Children's collaborates with the University of South Florida and NIH on experimental treatments for pediatric AIDS.<P>

   Lesley underwent preliminary tests at NIH last summer after Nelson recommended her for another drug. Lesley's immune system was too stable for that drug, Nelson said, but NIH researchers turned to her as soon as Immunogen was approved for tests in children.<P>

   ``It was rather serendipitous,'' Nelson said. ``The reason she's the first one is that she was in the system and fit the criteria at the time the protocol was approved.''<P>

   Lesley is one of 32 children NIH plans to test in phase one, which will determine whether the vaccine stimulates the immune system and is safe for use in children, Sei said. The 31 other children have not been selected.<P>

   If those tests are favorable, phase two would help researchers determine the dosage, the schedule and the way the drug should be administered in children. Finally, phase three would pinpoint effectiveness, Sei said.<P>

   ``We have no evidence that this will help the child. There is a chance the vaccine could even accelerate the disease, although it had the opposite effect in adults,'' Sei said.<P>

   However, Clementi said she's willing to take that chance. ``The other choice is to do nothing,'' she said. ``If we do that, I know what will happen.''
