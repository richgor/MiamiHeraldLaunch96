   CRESTVIEW -- A convicted pedophile has lost his court battle to have thousands of sexually explicit photographs of his victims and other youngsters returned to him.<P>

   Judge Keith Brace ruled that John Gay, 30, did not prove that he was legally entitled to possess the 7,500 photographs, many of which show nude boys.<P>

   Inspectors at the Okaloosa Correctional Institution had seized the pictures claiming they were pornographic and violated prison rules.<P>

   Gay claimed they were evidence for his pending appeals and accused officials of also seizing a photograph of his deceased mother.<P>

   Gay's civil complaint gained attention when Gov. Lawton Chiles cited his case as an example of frivolous lawsuits filed by prison inmates.<P>

   Gay vigorously denied that charge, saying he was trying to prove his innocence.<P>

   A former employee of a photo processing store, Gay was sentenced in 1990 to two life terms for sexual battery on children under 12 plus 210 years on related charges.<P>

   In the ruling signed last week, the judge warned Gay that he would face court sanctions if he files another lawsuit on the same issue.<P>

   Meanwhile, he denied the state's request that Gay be ordered to pay the state's legal fees.<P>

   The judge also ordered the destruction of any sexually explicit photographs, but ruled Gay can mail any nonoffensive pictures of children to a friend or relative. Otherwise, they will be destroyed as well.<P>

   ``This puts to rest an issue that's been dogging the prison and the taxpayers for five years,'' Assistant Attorney General David Frank said this week. ``It's outrageous that this case has consumed this kind of time and money, but that's what it takes.''<P>

   Chiles signed a bill last month intended to discourage frivolous inmate lawsuits. The lawsuits cost taxpayers an estimated $2.3 million annually.<P>

   About 1,200 cases are still pending statewide.
