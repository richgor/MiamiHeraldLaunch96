   JACKSONVILLE -- (AP) -- A woman, her father and brother were shot to death early Monday, but her 8-year-old son survived. Police were seeking the woman's former boyfriend for questioning.<P>

   ``It was a pretty gruesome scene,'' said Lt. David Gueterman, a homicide detective. He described the slayings as ``a crime of passion.''<P>

   The shootings occurred on both floors in a two-story townhouse at the Williamsburg Commons complex, and several shots were lodged in the apartment walls, he said.<P>

   Dentcho ``Danny'' Denev, 38, an auto mechanic who came to the United States five years ago from Bulgaria, was wanted for questioning.<P>

   Killed were Irina Leonova, 37; her brother, Sergey Zadnepryanets, 34; and their father, Yuriy Zadnepryanets, 62. All of the victims were Ukrainians from Kiev.<P>

   When called to the apartment, police found the brother's body outside and the bodies of the woman and her father inside. All died from gunshot wounds.<P>

   Leonova was a dentist in Kiev and was working as a dental assistant in Jacksonville.<P>

   Her son, Kirill Leonova, was in serious condition at University Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the right chest, a hospital spokesman said.<P>

   Denev had an ``on-again, off-again'' relationship with the woman and a prior record of domestic violence, Gueterman said. He said he hadn't determined if the previous incidents involved Denev's wife or the slain girlfriend.<P>

   ``We believe he [Denev] went over there as an ongoing confrontation with the brother. He confronted the brother, and the shooting began,'' Gueterman said.
