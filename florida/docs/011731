<m0>   TAMPA (--) An asthma attack is to blame in the death of an inmate whose relatives called for a probe to answer questions about how he died and if he had proper medical care, an investigator said.<ep>
   A Hillsborough County sheriff's investigator found no other cause for the April 17 death of inmate James Anderson, 39.<ep>
   A document about a fight with another inmate was written by Anderson for another inmate who didn't know how to write but didn't involve Anderson, as his family had presumed, according to papers released Tuesday.<ep>
   Relatives didn't know that Anderson, who had been incarcerated for most of the past 20 years, had asthma.<ep>
   He was serving a one-year sentence for violating probation.<ep>
   Sheriff's officials continue to look into the death, said Maj. Steve Saunders, commander of the Morgan Street jail where Anderson was housed.<ep>
   Saunders said once the report is completely reviewed, officials will decide if changes are needed.<ep>
   ``We are concerned. Somebody's life was lost, and we want to look at it,'' he said.<ep>
