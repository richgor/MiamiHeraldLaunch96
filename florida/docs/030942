<m0>ddie Stillings already was a three-time loser when his latest cocaine trafficking conviction landed on the steps of Tampa's Second District Court of Appeal a few months ago.<ep>
  But in Florida's justice system these days, just about anybody can come out a winner. Even Eddie Stillings.<ep>
  And sure enough, with the help of his state-paid lawyer, the 36-year-old Stillings recently gained a reversal from the appeals court.<ep>
  Not a reversal of his conviction, though. Instead, Stillings got what more and more defendants are getting (--) a reversal of part of his 15-year sentence. In Stillings' case, a teeny-tiny part: a $2 cost that was assessed by his trial judge.<ep>
  But it's the principle that matters. And the principle emerging from cases like Eddie Stillings' is this: The state's increasingly cumbersome and complex sentencing rules simply are becoming too much for judges and lawyers to handle.<ep>
  In Stillings' case, for example, the appeals court ruled that the $2 charge was illegal because the trial judge hadn't pronounced it separately at the moment when Stillings stood before him. A state statute allows judges to levy the charge for local government law enforcement training.<ep>
  ``The entire system frustrates me from the standpoint of what these characters can appeal,'' gripes Tampa prosecutor Lyann Goudie, who is still cleaning up the mess from Stillings' two-year-long appeals. ``The stupidity is endless.''<ql>
<m0>Burdening the courts<ep>
<m0>  In a system that often seems to demand diamond-cutter precision, Eddie Stillings' case is just the latest in a whole pile of slightly flawed rejects. In fact, as a recent informal study shows, such appeals of sentences are becoming a gigantic burden on Florida's courts.<ep>
  Back in 1970, the study shows, sentencing objections made up only 11 percent of the issues dealt with in written appellate decisions.<ep>
   By 1995, 52 percent of the issues considered by appeals courts in criminal cases involved sentencing, while only 48 percent concerned nonsentencing issues like evidence, guilt, etc. And the number of reversals for sentencing errors exceeded the number of reversals for nonsentencing errors. In many cases (--) like Eddie Stillings' case (--) the errors involved are relatively small. A few dollars in fines, say, or a few days or weeks on a sentencing score sheet.<ep>
  What's going on? The author of the study, lawyer William Haddad, says the main problem is that sentencing rules simply have become too numerous and too complicated.<ep>
  ``No matter what you say the sentence ought to be,'' says Haddad, ``it ought to be simpler.'' Haddad, who's the clerk of the Second District Court of Appeal, describes his findings in the latest Florida Bar Journal.<ql>
<m0>Lawmakers responsible<ep>
<m0>  Certainly lawmakers deserve blame for creating a sentencing scheme that's layered with multistep mathematical formulas and multiple-choice menus of fines, fees, costs and conditions.<ep>
  A big part of the solution could lie in a proposal now pending before the state Supreme Court. It would require defendants to raise objections to their sentences in the trial court within 10 days after sentencing. That could forestall a lot of time-consuming appeals later. But not all of them.<ep>
   Eddie Stillings' appeals, for instance. As of April 24, he was back in the Hillsborough County Jail awaiting a hearing in yet another appeal.<ep>
   ``You basically never get these guys off your back,'' says Goudie.<ql>
