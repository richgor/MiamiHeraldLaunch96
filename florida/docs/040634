<m0>   LARGO (--) A judge sentenced a convicted murderer to death, but a flaw in the jury instructions (--) which the judge knew about (--) may win the condemned man another chance.<ep>
   ``I don't believe it's a problem, said Pinellas Circuit Judge Tim Peters.<ep>
   He went ahead with sentencing because the old jury instructions were the only ones he had, and defense attorneys never objected to their use.<ep>
   The Florida Supreme Court has not approved new instructions.<ep>
   David Carpenter was sentenced Friday to die in Florida's electric chair for the murder of Ann Powell.<ep>
   During trial in March, Peters told jurors they could recommend a sentence of either death or life in prison with a chance of parole after 25 years.<ep>
   The jury recommended death by a 7-5 vote.<ep>
   The instructions given to the jury were based on a law that has changed. The Legislature has eliminated parole for first-degree murder. The sentence now is life in prison without parole.<ep>
   It applies to murders committed after May 25, 1994. Ann Powell was killed Nov. 23, 1994.<ep>
   Although the law changed, no one thought to change the jury instructions approved by the state's high court. So those instructions were used by Peters.<ep>
   It's not known how many jurors statewide have been given the same misinformation or whether the Supreme Court will consider the issue serious enough to overturn the sentence. The Supreme Court automatically hears all death cases.<ep>
   Pinellas State Attorney Bernie McCabe said the flaw was overlooked by the entire court system.<ep>
   ``I think it just slipped by,'' he said. ``It slipped by the defense, the prosecutors, the judges, everybody. It even slipped in the Supreme Court.''<ep>
   Chris Slobogin, a University of Florida law professor and a death penalty expert, said Peters' decision could be a serious error.<ep>
   ``The verdict was tainted by erroneous instructions,'' he said. ``It ought to be appealable.''<ep>
   A Supreme Court committee drafted a plan to change the jury instructions during a Miami meeting Friday, but the group did not have enough members present to approve the change, The St. Petersburg Times reported Saturday.<ep>
   In a nine-page sentencing order, the judge outlined details of the crime. Carpenter, 34, had invited Powell, a 63-year-old casual acquaintance, to his apartment for dinner and a dance.<ep>
   The Dunedin man also invited Neilan Pailing, 17, planning a three-way sexual encounter. When Powell resisted, she was raped, beaten and strangled with her bra.<ep>
   The Carpenter case marked the second time in three weeks that the flawed instructions were used in the Pinellas-Pasco circuit. In the Pasco County case, the judge has not decided whether to follow the jury's recommendation of death.<ep>
