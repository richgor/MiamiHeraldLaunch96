<m0>  WEST PALM BEACH (--) John Zile's lawyers called on a bevy of <m1> <m0>doctors Thursday to bolster their theory that Christina Holt's death may have been the accidental result of corporal punishment, not a brutal beating.<ep>
  The tiny 7-year-old could have just as easily died during her stepfather's lifesaving efforts, Dr. Michael Frank Arnall told the 12 jurors hearing the first-degree murder case.<ep>
  Defense attorneys also showed jurors a Mickey Mouse videotape customized at the start and the end with John Zile's loving messages to his daughter. The scene painted a picture of love and caring that prosecutors say dissolved into a fusillade of beatings that led to her death. But Judge Roger Colton refused to let a defense psychologist give jurors a glimpse inside Zile's mind.<ep>
   Norma Schulman, who examined Zile, would have testified that Zile lived in fear that his children would be taken away by the state. The fear began after a state social worker looked into a report of possible child abuse at the home of John and Pauline Zile. Schulman testified outside the presence of the jury that Zile, ``an extremely devoted family man,'' suffered a ``panic disorder'' and ``was not thinking clearly'' when he killed Christina in September 1994.<ep>
   Colton ruled Schulman's account out of order because it dealt primarily with the cover-up after the murder, not the murder itself. Much of Schulman's testimony focused on Zile's actions in the six weeks between the Sept. 16 murder and the day the Ziles admitted they had lied when they said Christina had been abducted on an October afternoon at the Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop.<ep>
  Pauline Zile was convicted of first-degree murder and has begun serving a life sentence. The case is being appealed.<ep>
  Prosecutors say Christina choked to death on her own vomit when Zile covered her mouth with his hand to keep her from screaming during a brutal beating.<ep>
   Arnall, a former associate medical examiner in Fort Myers, gave jurors a different scenario.<ep>
   Arnall testified that Christina could have suffered an epileptic seizure, vomited, choked and passed out.<ep>
  Zile testified Wednesday that Christina had a seizure during a spanking, choked and died despite his efforts to revive her.<ep>
  If Zile tried CPR and the Heimlich maneuver, as he told police that he did: ``it was exactly the wrong thing at the wrong time,'' and it killed her, Arnall testified.<ep>
  During the autopsy, Medical Examiner James Benz found food particles in Christina's airway and lungs.<ep>
  Benz wrote in the death certificate that the cause of death was: ''Asphyxia due to multiple blunt trauma.'' <ep>
  Arnall also testified that Christina's body, found six weeks after her death, was so badly decomposed that it is impossible to tell whether discolorations of her skin were bruises, let alone when those injuries occurred.<ep>
  Jurors are decidedly more restless now than at the start of the trial. They fidget more. Several rock vigorously in their chairs. Others swivel back and forth. They'll stand up, adjust their sweaters or coats, stretch or reach for something to drink during even the slightest break.<ep>
   Jurors will hear both rebuttal witnesses today. Closing statements will consume six hours Monday. Deliberations will start Tuesday. <m1>                <ql>
