   FORT MYERS -- Deputies patrolled a high school campus Monday as police investigated whether a group of teens accused of murdering the band director were also plotting to shoot tourists at Disney World.<P>

   ``Something galvanized these kids into violence and bloodlust, and it was unquenchable,'' Lee County Sheriff John McDougall said. ``It was like a vortex of bloodlust and arson. It was consuming them. They couldn't get enough.''<P>

   Four teenagers are charged with first-degree murder in the shooting of Riverdale High band instructor Mark Schwebes. Schwebes, 32, was shot in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun Tuesday as he stepped from his home to answer a knock at the door.<P>

   Several members of the group, who called themselves the Lords of Chaos, told authorities they shot Schwebes because he caught two of them as they planned to burn down the high school auditorium as part of an arson spree.<P>

   Schwebes, who did not realize the seriousness of their plans, let the teens go but told them he would report them to school authorities, McDougall said.<P>

   The leader of the group -- accused of pulling the trigger in Schwebes' death -- is 18-year-old Kevin Foster, a former Riverdale student and the son of a local gun dealer. The teens also shot Schwebes in the buttocks, McDougall said, because they thought he was homosexual.<P>

   Foster and students Peter Magnotti, 17; Christopher Black, 18; and Derek Shields, 17, were charged with first-degree murder, armed robbery, arson and carjacking. They were being held Monday without bond.<P>

   A fifth teen, Christopher Burnett, 17, was charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Two other teens are cooperating with deputies and haven't been charged.<P>

   Members of the group called Foster ``god,'' McDougall said. ``The others orbited around Foster.''<P>

    Authorities were looking into whether the group was also plotting to shoot black people at Disney World, as one of the teens told police, McDougall said.<P>

   ``They were homophobic, as well as racist,'' McDougall said. ``They were all white, all heavily armed. . . . There was some real hatred involved here.''<P>

   Members also confessed to other crimes, including torching a church and restaurant, and an armed robbery and carjacking at another restaurant.<P>

   The teens said they considered themselves an armed militia, not a street gang, McDougall said. Police confiscated dozens of weapons from their homes and cars, including M-16s, semiautomatic rifles, silencers, ski masks and camouflage outfits.<P>

   McDougall asked the FBI on Monday to investigate whether the teens had contact with militia groups. He also contacted the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms because of the large number of weapons involved.<P>

   The school district ordered beefed-up place for students who returned Monday to the county's 20 middle and high schools.<P>

   At Riverdale, deputies were patrolling the campus to keep out visitors and to prevent any violence. All the high school campuses were closed to visitors and the media during school hours to prevent disruptions.
