<m0>   ORLANDO (--) Volusia County officials felt vindicated Thursday by a federal judge's ruling that they complied with a court order to protect endangered sea turtles from beach motorists.<ep>
   In fact, U.S. District Judge Anne C. Conway said the county was to be congratulated for its temporary protection efforts. And the judge chastised the plaintiffs who sought a contempt order against county authorities.<ep>
   ``We won a moral victory. A big moral victory,'' said Assistant County Attorney Jamie Seaman.<ep>
   ``The court finds that, not only has the county fully complied with the court's Aug. 1 order, but that the county efforts to implement an effective strategy for enforcing its `zero tolerance' policy [toward violators] are to be commended,'' the judge wrote in a 12-page order issued late Wednesday.<ep>
   New Smyrna Beach residents Shirley Reynolds and Rita Alexander sued the county last year, claiming it was violating the U.S. Endangered Species Act by allowing traffic on beaches used by nesting sea turtles.<ep>
   Conway agreed and ordered strict enforcement of the law. But the plaintiffs later filed a motion for contempt of court, claiming the county's efforts were haphazard and inadequate.<ep>
   The judge disagreed and chided the two women for failing to cooperate with conservation efforts.<ep>
   ``Plaintiffs' time would be better spent in working with the county to educate the public about the damage that violations of the conservation zone cause to the sea turtles and in helping the county to identify the beaches where the most frequent violations occur, in a spirit akin to a neighborhood watch program,'' Conway wrote.<ep>
   Last year's court order prevents driving and parking in conservation zones 30 feet seaward from dunes along 41 miles of county beaches. The order was in effect during the May-through-October nesting season and is being followed again this year.<ep>
