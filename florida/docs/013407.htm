   Loren B. ``Totch'' Brown -- woodsman, fisherman, gator poacher, smuggler, storyteller and poet -- whose life and stories came to symbolize for Floridians the rugged spirit of the Everglades, has died on a little island camp he built on his beloved Chokoloskee Bay. He was 76, but seemed timeless, as epic and mythic as the Everglades themselves.<P>

  The son of a pioneering western Everglades family, whose formal education ended in the fourth grade, gave voice in prose and song his last years to the families that settled there in the late 1800s and suffered and died in the frontier tradition.<P>

  He died Wednesday of an apparent heart attack while laying a floor at a sort of hideout he kept on an island in Chokoloskee Bay, south of Naples alongside Everglades National Park. ``It was quick,'' said his close friend Marney Reed, who was with him. ``And it was where he wanted to be.''<P>

   It was never very clear whose island it was. Totch Brown considered them all his.<P>

   Deservedly so, said his friend Peter Matthiessen, author of the acclaimed Killing Mister Watson, a book about the famous outlaw shot dead in 1910 by Chokoloskee vigilantes.<P>

   ``Totch was built into the Everglades. He was ingrained in it. I don't know anyone who better personified its spirit,'' Matthiessen said.<P>

   Brown, whose family survived the Depression by camping on Ed Watson's Chatham River homestead, helped Matthiessen research the book. He also contributed to a sequel Matthiessen is now writing.<P>

   But Brown would never be content to let others tell his story. The University of Florida Press published Brown's autobiography, Totch: A Life in the Everglades, in 1993. The 18,500 copies sold had made it the press's No. 3 bestseller in 50 years of publishing. He was working on a novel and had completed 11 chapters when he died.<P>

   Florida novelist and outdoorsman Randy White, a longtime friend, recalls a camping trip he and Matthiessen took with Brown during which they joked about shooting and barbecuing a white ibis, so they could test Brown's pioneer recipe for ``Chokoloskee chicken.''<P>

   Recalls White: ``Totch said, `No, we can't do it. Can you imagine the headlines -- Totch Brown and two companions arrested.' ''<BR>
Boastful storyteller<P>

   Outrageous boasts were always a part of his storytelling. You had to guess when he was kidding. As Brown once told Matthiessen: ``I'm the best at anything I ever tried.''<P>

   And he was. Trouble was, some of those things were illegal. He was the first commercial fisherman on the Gulf to see a sales potential in stone crab claws, but was best known for his one-man war with alligators and game wardens.<P>

   ``From the time I was 14, until 1970, I hunted gators as hard as I could go,'' Brown said in a 1993 interview. ``I killed as many as 80 in a single night. Just every one I could possibly skin before they rotted.''<P>

   These were hard, hungry times, said his wife Estelle, who bore three daughters and a son: Lorna, Elaine, Judy and Loren. ``My God, this was food for the kids. However you got it you got it.''<P>

   Theirs was a culture of violence, but also of innocence. When they married, he was 19 and she was 16. During her first labor, both of them cried over the contractions, thinking she must be dying.<BR>
Marijuana smuggler<P>

   Theirs was also a culture that made its own rules. After demand for gator hides dwindled in the late '70s, Brown joined nearly 100 other men in Chokoloskee and Everglades City in a marijuana smuggling operation that extended from Central America to the Gulf Coast. He and his neighbors were caught in 1983, and Brown served 18 months for tax evasion.<P>

   Upon release, he turned to writing, creating a history of the taming of a wilderness. Estelle, who could shoot as well as he could, was his starring character. He called her his ``Queen of the Everglades.''<P>

   When she died last year, Brown ``sobbed over her coffin,'' said his sister Laberta Thompson. ``For all his shortcomings, he was a hell of a man.''<P>

   He continued to write. His secretary Debbie Ford said he was building the cabin so he could write without interruption. The book was a thriller based on his smuggling exploits.<P>

   Brown also was promoting a movie based on his life, wheeling and dealing by phone with a variety of Hollywood bigwigs. He wanted Willie Nelson to play him. They met when Nelson came to Florida to record a song Totch wrote, Down in the Everglades, for a new Joe Pesci movie called Gone Fishin'.<P>

   Brown also recently helped produce a video -- recorded at his cabin -- depicting the pioneers who survived in the Everglades in the old days. ``I played a pioneer woman,'' said Ford. ``Totch played himself.''<BR>
Loved showing off Glades<P>

   But what he loved most was taking friends and almost anyone else who asked on what he called his ``million-dollar tour'' -- a meandering, all-day boat ride past the oyster bars, Indian mounds, mangrove swamps and secret creeks of his lifelong sanctuary.<P>

   Just so they could see the fierce wild thing the Everglades was and is.<P>

   ``It's just a damn shame that the knowledge I have of this country is fixing to go to nothing,'' he explained. ``I hate for it just to be gone.''<P>

   A visitation will be held from 4 p.m. to 8 tonight at the Johnson/Pittman Funeral Chapel, 4424 E. Tamiami Trail, Naples. Services will be held at 1 p.m. Saturday at the Chokoloskee Church of God on Demere Street. Burial beside Estelle will follow. For information, call (941) 774-3444.
