  Jurors heard a tape Tuesday of John Zile explaining how he slapped, spanked, and ``whacked'' his stepdaughter, Christina Holt.<P>

  Zile is charged with first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse in the September 1994 death of Christina. He and his wife Pauline concocted an elaborate scheme to hide her death -- with tearful pleas on TV, they claimed Christina had disappeared from the Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop.<P>

  All the while they were fool<BR>
ing the public, Christina's body was buried behind a Kmart in Tequesta.<P>

  The prosecution rested its case Tuesday, finishing up with the statement John Zile gave police after the ruse unraveled.<P>

  Christina was a lying, manipulating little girl, Zile told police. She had ``an attitude,'' and didn't listen to her parents.<P>

  Zile's tone of voice was matter-of-fact as he confessed to police October 28, 1994. The 7-year-old girl died while he was punishing her, Zile said, but it was an accident. She had a seizure, he said, soon after he started disciplining her for lying, and for soiling her pants.<P>

  ``I was highly upset,'' Zile told police. ``I asked her why, and she said, `because I felt like it.' That's when I smacked her.''<P>

  He hit her in the mouth, hard enough to draw blood. She started crying, Zile said, ``starting to whine.'' So he put his hand over her mouth.<P>

   ``The boys were in the next room,'' he said. ``I didn't want them to wake up.''<P>

  The beating lasted less than five minutes. Her mother sat on the couch most of that time, watching.<P>

  Zile said Christina, who had only lived with her mother and John Zile for three months before her death, had sexually molested at least one of his young sons, and then lied about it.<P>

    After she ``expired,'' Zile said, he wrapped her body in a blanket, and laid it on the bed, ``like she was going to sleep.''<P>

  The next day, he stuffed the body in a closet, where it remained for four days until he buried it in Tequesta.<P>

  Zile explained why they came up with the missing girl hoax.<P>

 ``We wanted to save ourselves and our family, and her family, from the anguish of knowing the truth,'' Zile said. ``At least there would be hope, they'd remember her as she was.''<P>

  While his voice on the tape was impassive, Zile looked shaken as he sat listening to it in the courtroom. He kept his face turned from the jury and the public, and wiped his eyes occasionally as the tape played.
