   KISSIMMEE -- The victim's parents watched in quiet disbelief as a primly dressed teenager pleaded guilty to being an accessory to murder for keeping silent about the gang killing of their 22-year-old son.<P>

   Rebecca and Larry Oliver Sr. sat in the courtroom's first row as they watched Mary Lineberger, 19, wipe her eyes with a tissue and offer her plea in such a soft voice the judge told her to speak up.<P>

   A waitress by day and stripper by night, she was the third young adult in as many days to admit a role in the shotgun killing of the Olivers' son.<P>

   Her crime was saying nothing about the slaying while the Olivers prayed through six nights for their son's safe return home.<P>

   Larry Oliver Jr. lay dead in an orange grove.<P>

   And not one of a group of seven friends called for help, despite watching the killing, cleaning up afterward, stripping the victim's shiny red pickup or destroying evidence, investigators said.<P>

   ``It's so hard to say what I ask myself, what I think about when I see her,'' Larry Oliver Sr. said after watching Lineberger plead guilty Thursday. ``She went about her normal life for an entire week. She sat on the information and didn't say anything.<P>

   ``The moral thing is to go forward and tell what you know. But there's a lot of morality this group didn't have. They didn't have the moral background our son had.''<P>

   The man accused of the killing, Jermaine ``Bugsy'' Gleason, is in jail in New York, where he had a court hearing Thursday to fight extradition to Osceola County.<P>

   A judge's decision was expected soon.<P>

   Gleason and most of his co-defendants were members of a youth gang known as Four-Play, records show. Members believed they were closer than family and pledged to live and die by the knife and gun.<P>

   The only way out of the gang was to die, one of the members said in a sworn statement.<P>

   The Four-Play members met through jobs at Walt Disney World or at topless bars in Orlando. Lineberger, 19, bridged both worlds.<P>

   Three others are expected to plead guilty in coming weeks.
