<m0>  A fire that sent hundreds of cruise ship passengers scrambling Wednesday afternoon was still too hot Thursday for investigators to discover how it started.<ep>
   ``They haven't done anything yet, they're waiting for the boat to cool down,'' said Petty Officer Jeff Hall, a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard.<ep>
   Inspectors from the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office joined officials from Panama in Freeport, Bahamas, Thursday to begin their investigation into a fire in the engine room of the Discovery One.<ep>
   Hall said the majority of the damage occurred in the engine room and crew quarters on the ship's lower level.<ep>
  Firefighters were still trying to bring the blaze under control Thursday at the Freeport Port Authority. No one was hurt.<ep>
   ``It was so hot, it was hard to cool down to get under control,'' Hall said.<ep>
   The fire was discovered at noon Wednesday while the ship was about three miles from Freeport. Capt. George Salichos was alerted to smoke in the engine room and ordered the engines shut down as a precautionary measure, said Discovery spokesman Larry Turner.<ep>
   Discovery One, built in 1971 and renovated in 1985, was carrying about 600 passengers and 400 crew members on a day cruise and was scheduled to return Wednesday night to Port Everglades, said spokeswoman Roberta Backus.<ep>
   With the engines off, tugboats from Bahamas Oil Refinery towed the ship to port.<ep>
   Television reports from the Bahamas on Thursday quoted passengers who called the ordeal chaotic.<ep>
   ``It was very bad, very black smoke,'' Joyce Hanley told WTVJ-Channel 6 in Freeport. ``There was burning paint falling onto the deck.''<ep>
   But company officials said the emergency was handled with calm.<ep>
   ``There was no panic. There were no injuries,'' Turner said. ``That is a testament to the professionalism of the captain, the officers and the crew.''<ep>
   About 350 passengers returned Wednesday to Port Everglades on the Sea Escape. Some who had airline connections were flown back, Backus said.<ep>
   Others stayed in Freeport Wednesday night and were sailing back Thursday. They were scheduled to arrive Thursday night on the Discovery Sun at the Port of Miami. Passengers were offered another cruise, Turner said.<ep>
   This wasn't the first fire for the Fort Lauderdale-based ship, which is registered in Panama.<ep>
   In 1992, a fire broke out in a deep fryer at a snack bar while the ship was docked at Port Everglades. Crew members spotted the fire and contained the flames until firefighters arrived and put it out. No one was injured.<ql>
