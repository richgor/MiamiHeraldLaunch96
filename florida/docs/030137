<m0>   WEST PALM BEACH (--) Water managers have agreed to buy 21,702 acres of prime Florida panther territory in Hendry County at the headwaters of the Big Cypress National and Fakahatchee Strand State preserves.<ep>
   ``It's one of the greatest natural sites in South Florida,'' South Florida Water Management District board member Nat Reed said after voting to buy the land. Buying the land ``has been the dream of everyone who's familiar with it.''<ep>
   The district board unanimously voted Thursday to buy the tract for the appraised value of $11.5 million, or $530 an acre, from citrus grower Alico.<ep>
   The purchase includes Okaloacoochee Slough and Twelve Mile Slough southeast of LaBelle and southwest of Clewiston, and includes more than 11,000 acres of wetlands covered by sawgrass, oak hammocks and cabbage palm islands.<ep>
   The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission gave the slough its highest ranking for habitat protection and cited the need for the land in its Florida panther protection plan.<ep>
   Water managers plan to ask the state's Conservation and Recreation Lands program to pay for half of the purchase.<ep>
   The public eventually will be able to use the land for recreation, such as canoeing and hiking, after a management plan is developed by the state Division of Forestry, which will manage the tract.<ep>
   Sam Poole, executive director of the water management district, praised Alico for preserving the land in good condition.<ep>
   ``It's a positive move to protect the lands for the benefit of the state,'' Alico Chairman Ben Hill Griffin III said.<ep>
   The purchase comes as the federal government is moving to buy land on the eastern edge of the Everglades. Congress approved and the president signed a farm bill in April that included more than $200 million for the purchase of farmland to convert back to marsh.<ep>
   Talisman Sugar, owned by Jacksonville-based St. Joe Paper, increased the asking price for a 52,000-acre tract south of Lake Okeechobee after the federal money was approved. Talisman is now asking $190 million, about $34 million more than earlier estimates.<ep>
   Environmentalists and their allies in government have long sought the Talisman tract to establish a water storage area and attempt to imitate the natural water flow to the Everglades.<ep>
