  TALLAHASSEE (--) Theoretically, starting in 1997, the Florida Lottery will help send high school graduates with a B average or better to college.<ep>
  In the final hours of the legislative session last week, the Legislature created a lottery scholarship program that will be worth up to $2,180 a year for tens of thousands of Floridians (--) if a future Legislature comes up with the money.<ep>
  ``It's the first step in making the lottery accountable to the public,'' said Rep. Dean Saunders, D-Lakeland, the prime sponsor of the bill.<ep>
  Lottery anger is a hot topic in Florida (--) so hot this election year that various legislators filed a score of bills to reform lottery spending.<ep>
  Voters adopted the lottery a decade ago to provide money for extras in schools. But only a fraction of the lottery money has been earmarked for specific improvements. As education budgets have tightened and the number of students in Florida schools rose, the Legislature and school boards have used lottery money to pay basic costs of keeping schools running.<ep>
  The lottery scholarship bill is a thin version of a sweeping lottery reform package Saunders started out with. Despite the anger about what happened to lottery proceeds, legislators couldn't figure how to come up with $730 million in new tax money for schools to take the place of lottery dollars <m1> <m0>already committed to basic operations.<ep>
  The bill simply says lottery scholarships will take effect after 1996. It doesn't bind next year's Legislature to <m1> <m0>appropriate the scholarship money.<ep>
  Saunders predicts that when word of the scholarship gets out to students, parents and teachers, legislators will feel intense pressure to find the money. The key will be making sure the Legislature doesn't pay for college scholarships by cutting money for instruction, he said.<ep>
  First, the bill has to get past Gov. Lawton Chiles, who hasn't decided whether to approve <m1> <m0>it. In the past, Chiles has campaigned for the Legislature to come up with the tax money necessary to devote all lottery dollars to enhancement.<ep>
  Education Commissioner Frank Brogan said Monday the Department of Education will have a plan for running the scholarship program for the Legislature to consider next year. A major goal, he said, will be to make sure that students actually receive the full, in-state tuition to public schools and the book allowance the bill promises.<ep>
  Brogan said he wants to prevent a recurrence of what happens with an existing, smaller state scholarship program for top Florida students that promises awards of $2,500 a year. They get less because the Legislature doesn't provide enough money for all recipients to <m1> <m0>receive the full amount.<ep>
  State university system Chancellor Charles Reed said universities would agree for money they currently get from the lottery to go into scholarships if the Legislature would replace the money with new tax dollars. ``If they'll do that, it's a good idea.''<ep>
  But if the state pays for scholarships by lowering the quality of college instruction, Reed said, ``it's not worth it.''<ep>
