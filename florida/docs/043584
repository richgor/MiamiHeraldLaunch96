<m0>   PANAMA CITY (--) The Goosebumps series of ``soft-core horror'' novels for young readers will remain in Bay County elementary schools.<ep>
   The School Board rejected a request by a third-grade student's parents to ban the books after the student's teacher read a Goosebumps story to her class in suburban Lynn Haven.<ep>
   The board, however, adopted a policy that will permit parents in the Florida Panhandle county to ask for alternative assignments or placement of their children if they find classroom materials objectionable.<ep>
   The school system cannot be a parent, said Superintendent Stefanie Gall, who had recommended the board action.<ep>
   ``We can't be all things to all people,'' Gall said. ``There are things on the shelves that I don't like. I'm not thrilled with the Goosebumps series.''<ep>
   Media technology coordinator Loretta Hugghins said the books are not high-quality literature but are high-interest, low-reading-level stories that inspire many students to read on a regular basis.<ep>
   The ban had been sought by Kip and Lisa Clinton. Kip Clinton fought back tears as he read passages from the books, some describing ``living dead'' dissolving into dust or eating ``human-looking bones.''<ep>
   Board members, however, said the excerpts were brief and out of context.<ep>
   Lisa Clinton also was overcome by emotion as she described research linking violence in children to violence they see in the media.<ep>
   Board member Henrietta Swilley disputed those findings and pointed out many fairy tales and nursery rhymes have gruesome aspects, such as the wolf that tried to eat Little Red Riding Hood only to be hacked apart by a woodsman.<ep>
