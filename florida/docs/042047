<m0>   PENSACOLA (--) Pensacola Christian College is suspending its building program to pay back taxes to the federal government, although the Florida Legislature has agreed to forgive $3.5 million owed to the state.<ep>
   The college agreed in January to pay an undisclosed amount to the Internal Revenue Service to settle income taxes owed from 1988 through 1995 by its profit-making A Beka Book Publications Division.<ep>
   ``We're not planning to build any new buildings until all of this is taken care of,'' said Joel Mullenix, vice president for public affairs. ``It's a big impact for us and for the community.''<ep>
   A Beka is one of the nation's largest publishers of Christian school books, and its success has helped finance $120 million in construction at the campus, which includes Pensacola Christian Academy, since 1988. Projects put on hold include a 148-seat planetarium.<ep>
   Last week, the Florida Legislature passed a bill that would excuse the college from back taxes owed the state. The corporate income tax break was added in the hectic closing hours of the legislative session to an unrelated bill. Few lawmakers realized what it did because the provision did not actually name the college.<ep>
   It was passed at the request of two influential Pensacola lawmakers, House Appropriations Chairman Buzz Ritchie, a Democrat, and Republican Sen. W.D. Childers.<ep>
   An earlier estimate that the waiver would be worth $7 million was based on preliminary information and has been cut in half.<ep>
