   ORLANDO -- A man posing as a doctor and two others were charged with third-degree murder for running a bogus company targeting tourists at hotels for medical services that ended up killing an 11-year-old girl from England.<P>

   Rebecca Richards was visiting Orlando two years ago when she became ill. Her grandmother took the girl to Amrishkumar H. Patel, who prescribed antibiotics. A day later, Rebecca -- a skinny girl with blond hair to her waist -- was dead.<P>

   She turned out to be suffering from a critical case of juvenile diabetes that had gone undiagnosed. Authorities pinned her death on Patel and the two associates, saying the three ran an elaborate medical scam at Central Florida hotels, The Orlando Sentinel reported Saturday.<P>

   ``If she'd been treated by a legitimate doctor she'd be alive today,'' detective Tom McCann said.<P>

   Patel, 29, Marlein Cabrera Villafana, 22, and her husband, William Villafana, 30, were arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder, as well as manslaughter.<P>

   The husband and wife were arrested in Miami and were being held on $5,000 bond each. Patel was taken into custody in Edison, N.J., and was being held without bail. Each member of the group also faces charges of practicing medicine without a license.<P>

   Rebecca came to South Florida in 1993 with her grandmother, sister and a group of family friends. She was feeling ill after the flight from England.<P>

   Her grandmother found a card in the girl's room at the Marriott hotel on International Drive for On-Call Medical Services, a firm that made house calls for tourists. The woman phoned, and Patel examined Rebecca for a $125 fee.<P>

   Authorities said Patel is not licensed in the United States but had some training in India. He diagnosed Rebecca with a minor throat ailment and prescribed an antibiotic.<P>

   The next day, the girl's condition deteriorated. Patel suggested continuing the medication, gargling with salt water and spending time in the sun. That afternoon, Rebecca fell into a diabetic coma and died.<P>

   The doctor who reviewed the case said Patel had apparently missed several symptoms that pointed to serious illness. Deputy Chief Medical Examiner William Anderson said ``any practitioner'' would have done a full medical workup on the girl after checking her out.<P>

   ``He never even looked to see how dehydrated she was,'' Anderson said. ``It seemed to me it was certainly reckless.''<P>

   Elizabeth Richards says she still finds the sequence of events that killed her daughter two years ago difficult to understand. She wonders how the Villafanas were able to run a business without anyone verifying that the company was legitimate.<P>

   ``You'd think a big hotel like that would check,'' she said from her south Yorkshire home in England.<P>

   Officials at the Marriott don't know how the referral card got into the girl's hotel room.<P>

   Investigators have a theory. They believe that hotel employees throughout the area were paid $25 each time they referred a guest to the Villafanas' service.<P>

   There is no requirement that such businesses submit a list of employees and credentials to the state. The company roamed from city to city, operating out of a mailbox, police say.<P>

   ``They just follow the tourists like a lion will follow a pack of wildebeests,'' McCann said.
