<m0>   GAINESVILLE (--) (AP) (--) Although groundbreaking for the University of Florida Brain Institute has yet to start, a $13.3 million federal grant will someday help fill the facility with high-tech equipment.<ep>
   U.S. Rep. Bill Young, R-St. Petersburg, who shepherded the request through Congress, announced the Department of Defense/Veterans Affairs Medical Program award Friday.<ep>
   Young said the investment will heavily outweigh the costs of treating brain diseases.<ep>
   ``The research that this money will help fund . . . will deal with issues like head and neck injuries, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (--) so many diseases of the neurological system, the brain,'' said the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, which approved the grant.<ep>
   The equipment will include body scanners, computers and a 12-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging unit. Once the 200,000-square-foot center opens in 1998, faculty from both UF and the Gainesville Veterans Administration will make use of the facility.<ep>
   Construction of the center, which will double as a training center for military health care professionals, is supported by an $18 million Defense Department award matched with another $26 million from the university's College of Medicine and Shands Hospital.<m2><ep>
