   JACKSONVILLE (--) An auto mechanic wanted in the slayings of three members of a Ukrainian family here was arrested Tuesday after running out of gas in North Carolina.<ep>
   Dentcho ``Danny'' Denev, 38, who came to the United States five years ago from Bulgaria, was arrested in Sampson County, N.C., said Harry Reagan, a spokesman for the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.<ep>
   When authorities in North Carolina checked his auto tag, they learned he was wanted in Florida, Reagan said. Sampson County is about 400 miles north of Jacksonville on Interstate 95.<ep>
   ``There was no resistance,'' said Sampson County Sheriff Buck McCullen. ``This guy had given out of gas and had gone to a service station to obtain gas and had caught a ride back. When he got back . . . he was arrested at that point.''<ep>
   McCullen said the suspect showed officers a .40-caliber Glock pistol that authorities think may have been the weapon in the slayings. The pistol was under the front seat, the sheriff said.<ep>
   Denev is charged in a Florida warrant with three counts of first-degree murder and one count of aggravated battery.<ep>
   Killed early Monday were his former girlfriend, Irina Leonova, 37; her brother, Sergey Zadnepryanets, 34, and her father, Yuri Zadnepryanets, 62. All the victims were Ukrainian Jews from Kiev.<ep>
   Leonova's 8-year-old son, Kiril, was listed in serious condition Tuesday at University Medical Center.<ep>
   Reagan said he did not know if Denev planned to fight extradition back to Jacksonville.<ep>
   The shootings occurred about 12:30 a.m. Monday at the Williamsburg Commons apartments. All the victims died of multiple gunshot wounds.<ep>
   Denev had an ``on-again, off-again'' relationship with the woman and a prior record of domestic violence, said Lt. David Gueterman, a police homicide detective, said Monday.<ep>
   Gueterman said the initial target may have been the woman's brother, who often tried to protect her from Denev and repeatedly warned him to stay away.<ql>
