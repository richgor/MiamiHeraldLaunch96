   DAYTONA BEACH (--) One of four teenagers charged in the murder of a Canadian tourist was released from jail Tuesday on $50,000 bond.<ep>
   Scott Russell Malone, 15, of Umatilla, left the Volusia County Branch Jail on Tuesday afternoon, a day after Circuit Judge Edwin Sanders set bail.<ep>
   Malone and his co-defendants had been held without bond for their alleged involvement in the March 15 murder of Canadian high school student Mark Fyke during a botched robbery attempt. All four have pleaded innocent.<ep>
   Sanders attached conditions to Malone's release. He must stay at home unless accompanied by his parents and he has to stay in Lake County unless he's meeting his lawyer or attending court.<ep>
   Malone and another 15-year-old, William Marshal Schmidt, of Astor, and Donald Shoup Jr., 17, of Ormond Beach, were charged with being accessories to murder and attempted armed robbery in Fyke's slaying at a beachside pay telephone.<ep>
   John O'Neal Rainey, 17, of Umatilla, was charged with killing the Ontario teenager, who was on a spring break vacation, just as he hung up the phone after speaking to his mother.<ep>
