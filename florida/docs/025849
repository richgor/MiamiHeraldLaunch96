<m0>ALLAHASSEE (or, as William Bartram spelled it, Talahasochte) (--) The handsome new Library of America edition of William Bartram's 1791 classic, <m0>Travels Through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida, <m0>is cause for rejoicing, mingled with melancholy.<ep>
   We can rejoice that the book is appearing in a deluxe format, printed on acid-free paper, including a large selection of Bartram's own artwork (--) 16 pages of full-color plates, 32 pages of black-and-white drawings. (If you think the $37.50 price tag is steep, a 1792 British edition of the work was priced at $2,950 at an antiquarian book fair last month in St. Petersburg.)<ep>
   But we can also feel a pang of sorrow, reading Bartram's glorious descriptions of Florida when he saw it on his 1773-77 journey, and realizing how much has been lost, what a terrestrial Eden this place was two centuries ago, and what a ruin we've made of it since.<ep>
   ``Dewy evening now came on,'' Bartram wrote, camping on a starry night at Payne's Prairie, south of Gainesville. ``The glorious sovereign of the day, calling in his bright beaming emanations, left us in his absence to the milder government and protection of the silver queen of night, attended by millions of brilliant luminaries.<ep>
   ``The thundering alligator had ended his horrifying roar; the silver plumed gannet and stork, the sage and solitary pelican of the wilderness, had already retired to their silent nocturnal habitations, in the neighboring forests; the sonorous savanna cranes, in well-disciplined squadrons, now rising from the earth, mounted aloft in spiral circles, far above the dense atmosphere of the humid plain; they again viewed the glorious sun, and the light of day still gleaming on their polished feathers, they sung their evening hymn, then in a straight line majestically descended, and alighted on the towering Palms or lofty Pines, their secure and peaceful lodging places. All around being still and silent, we repaired to rest.''<ep>
   Today two major highways, Interstate 75 and Route 441, slash across the prairie, and a strip joint called Cafe Risque (motto: ``We Dare To Bare!'') stands at its southern border. Bartram, a gentle Quaker, would be horrified to see what goes on inside it.<ql>

2,400 miles of Southeast<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,2 <styl>txt,16p6<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   A failure as a farmer, bankrupt as a merchant, Bartram undertook his 2,400-mile journey through the southeastern United States with the backing of John Fothergill, an English doctor and naturalist whose garden in England was famous. His rhapsodic descriptions of what he saw had a profound influence on the English Romantic movement.<ep>
   Before Bartram, many Europeans regarded America with the same nervous horror that would be reserved for ``Darkest Africa'' in the 19th Century. In his 1770 poem, <m0>The Deserted Village, <m0>Oliver Goldsmith described an imaginary, ghastly landscape around southeast Georgia's Altamaha River, listing:<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,2<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   <m0> ``The various terrors of that horrid shore<ep>
    Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray<ep>
    And fiercely shed intolerable day;<ep>
    Those matted woods where birds forget to sing<ep>
    But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling;<ep>
    Those poisonous fields with rank luxuriance crown'd,<ep>
    Where the dark scorpion gathers death around;<ep>
    Where at each step the stranger fears to wake<ep>
    The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake;<ep>
    Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey,<ep>
    And savage men, more murd'rous still than they. . . .''<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,2<ql>
<m1>   <ep>
<m0>   Passing through the actual landscape three years later, Bartram wrote:<ep>
 ``How gently flow thy peaceful floods, O Altamaha! How sublimely rise to view, on thy elevated shores, yon magnolian groves, from whose tops the surrounding expanse is perfumed, by clouds of incense, blended with the exhaling balm of the liquidambar, and odours continually arising from circumambient groves of illicium, myrica, laurus and bignonia.''<ep>
   Goldsmith's gruesome jungle is Bartram's bed of roses.<ep>
   Bartram waited until 1791 to publish his <m0>Travels,<m0> and critics at first believed he was exaggerating wildly, with his extravagant descriptions of crystal springs, his limitless pine and oak forests, his tremendous flocks of birds, his amazing rattling snakes capable of hypnotizing their prey, his gigantic alligators bellowing in ``diaphanous'' lakes filled with millions of fish, and his noble ``Siminole'' Indians. Over and over, Bartram refers to the region as ``Paradise'' and ``Elysium.''<ql>

<m0>His poetic descriptions<ql>
hold true to science<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,2 <styl>txt,16p6<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   But time and science have confirmed his accuracy. Bartram was a brilliant, observant botanist (--) the Indians named him ``Puc Puggy,'' or ``plant collector'' (--) and discovered several species new to science, such as the oak-leaf hydrangea, the eared magnolia, and a beautiful flowering tree he discovered growing only on the banks of the Altamaha, and which he named <m0>Franklinia alatamaha, <m0>after Benjamin Franklin. His route can be retraced with considerable exactitude today.<ep>
   English Romantic poets admired his style and subject matter. William Wordsworth wrote two poems, <m0>Ruth  <m0>and <m0>Seminolies,<m0> based on Bartram's work. Samuel Taylor Coleridge based part of his opium-inspired realm of Xanadu, ``where Alph, the sacred river, ran/ Through caverns measureless to man/ Down to a sunless sea . . .'' on Bartram's description of Welaka Springs, near Lake George.<ep>
   ``In front, just under my feet, was the inchanting and amazing crystal fountain, which incessantly threw up, from dark, rocky caverns below, tons of water every minute . . . a continual and amazing ebullition. . . .''<ep>
 Yet Florida was already being despoiled in Bartram's day. He saw forests along the St. Johns River near Palatka ``violated, defaced, and torn to pieces . . . exhibiting a mournful, sallow countenance.'' British planters believed the woods harbored mosquitoes, and cut them down.<ep>
 Alas, if Bartram were to return to Florida today, he would probably be run over or mugged. It is toward Goldsmith's ``horrid shore,'' not Bartram's pristine paradise, that we are tending.<ep>
   The ``blooming realms of Florida'' that the Quaker traveler marveled at have shrunk to rare islands in a sea of masonry and macadam, and the landscape of his pages is practically mythical now, no longer of this world. <m0>Franklinia alatamaha  <m0>is actually extinct in the wild. It grows only in gardens and greenhouses.<ep>
  The road to Xanadu begins beside a beautiful spring, and ends, two centuries later, in a theme park.<ql>
