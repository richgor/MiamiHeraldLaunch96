   Quivering and sobbing, John Zile tried to explain to a jury Wednesday what happened the night his stepdaughter died.<P>

   ``It wasn't murder,'' he said again and again. ``She died.''<P>

   The bruises on the face of 7-year-old Christina Holt, he testified, didn't come from him. ``Post mortem'' is when they happened.<P>

   Zile, 34, charged with first-degree murder and trying to keep out of the electric chair, testified for 90 minutes. Jurors stared in rapt attention.<P>

   For days they heard him depicted as a sadistic bully who terrorized Christina with brutal punishments until the moment she died. Then he buried her behind a shopping center and concocted a kidnapping hoax to explain her disappearance.<P>

   His unexpected appearance on the stand came a day after jurors heard his taped confession. In it, Zile sounded clinical and detached as he matter-of-factly told detectives that the child lied and misbehaved and he was disciplining her when she had a seizure and died.<P>

   Wednesday, in contrast, Zile was alive with emotion.<P>

   His voice cracked and his eyes welled with tears as he looked into the faces of the jury and described the events of the night of Sept. 16, 1994.<P>

  It was near midnight, Zile recalled, and Christina was still awake. He called her to the living room of their tiny Singer Island apartment to have yet another talk about her misbehavior -- she was lying, acting up, sexually molesting her young stepbrothers, he said. <P>

   ``I was frantic at this point. I'd tried just about everything, talking to her, making her write `I won't <BR>
<BR>

<PRE>PLEASE SEE  ZILE,  12A

  

</PRE>
<PRE>ZILE,  FROM  1A
</PRE>
act up, I won't lie.' I had spanked her,'' Zile said. <P>

   ``I had even at one point, did the asinine thing of flicking my fingers on her lips when she lied to me.''<P>

  She soiled her pants as he lectured her. He told her to take a bath, then he dressed her in fresh pajamas.<P>

 ``I asked her why she defecated in front of me, and she told me she felt like it. I got upset,'' Zile said.<BR>
Staring strangely<BR>
<P>

  Then he noticed her staring strangely. ``She was just staring right through me,'' he said. ``I thought she was dizzy, I thought she might fall.''<P>

  Then she started ``clawing at herself,'' Zile said, moving his hands across his chest to demonstrate. She clenched her teeth, and bit down on her tongue.<P>

  He tried smelling salts and tried putting her in a cold bath. He thought it was an epileptic fit, like one she had a few weeks earlier. Christina wasn't diagnosed with epilepsy, but her mother Pauline suffered from it. <P>

   ``All I saw was that blank stare. There no noise or anything. I didn't hear her heartbeat, I checked her pulse, I didn't feel a pulse.''<P>

<P>

 ``I put her to bed, like she was going to sleep,'' Zile said, weeping. ``I went out in the living room and cried, praying she would wake up. I went in and checked on her, to see if she was awake.<P>

 ``She wasn't awake. She was dead.''<BR>
Wrapped her in blanket<BR>
<P>

  The next day, he said, he wrapped her in a blanket and put her body in a closet, so his sons Chad, 3, and Daniel, 5, wouldn't see her. Four days later, he buried her behind the Tequesta Kmart.<P>

  A month later, to cover her absence, he and his wife told an elaborate abduction story that fooled police and the public for a while, until blood stains were found in their apartment. <P>

   Christina, his wife's daughter by another man, lived with them only three months. His wife was pregnant, but they decided to give the baby boy up for adoption because they couldn't handle four children.<P>

 ``I thought everything was going well,'' Zile said. ``She was bonding with us, she became a big sister to Daniel and Chad.''<P>

  Then school started. Christina thought she was just in Florida for a summer vacation, Zile said, and she wanted to go back to her friends in Maryland, where her grandparents had raised her for most of her life.<P>

  Zile said Christina ``acted up'' in school, and at home. As punishment for pouring a bottle of Pert shampoo down the drain, he took away her pink bike. His wife pawned it for $10. <BR>
Pawned video tapes<BR>
<P>

   They pawned some of the 70 video tapes her grandparents had sent her. They pawned her Hooked on Phonics set. They made her stand in the corner.<P>

  ``We wanted her to be with us, we just wanted her to be good, to be a happy family'' Zile said, tearfully. ``At the time, she said she wanted to so I took her back home.''<P>

   Prosecutor Scott Cupp said Zile couldn't have cared much for the little girl because he buried the body and didn't tell anyone, not even her mother, where it was.<P>

   ``You destroyed her, so you set out to destroy her memory, too,'' Cupp said.<P>

   ``That's not true,'' Zile replied.<P>

   ``You ever hear of 911?'' Cupp asked.<P>

   ``Yes.''<P>

   ``Isn't it true that when she died, nobody was with her who gave a damn about her?'' Cupp asked.<P>

   ``We all gave a damn about her, Mr. Cupp,'' Zile said defiantly.
