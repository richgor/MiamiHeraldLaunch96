   PANAMA CITY -- A letter sent by Corrections Corp. of America to other tenants of the Bay County Industrial Park touched a raw nerve with Connie Pettis.<P>

   It detailed what would happen if an inmate escaped from the private state prison run by the Nashville-based company about 10 miles northeast of this Panhandle city.<P>

   ``I said, `Wait a minute! We were told these people would be so happy to be in a step-down program . . . that there wasn't going to be any escapes,' '' said Pettis, co-owner of Fiberoptic Engineering.<P>

   Her company was one of four tenants that went to court in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the 750-bed medium-security prison from being built.<P>

   The prison quietly opened last fall in a secluded corner of the park.<P>

   Other tenants have accepted their new neighbors, including Jim Scott, whose company was a plaintiff in the lawsuit.<P>

   ``You don't even know they're there, with the exception of the traffic,'' said Scott, president and chief executive officer of Sunshine Piping. ``Why would I notice them? It's not like they fire guns or cannons.''<P>

   Corrections Corp. spokeswoman Susan Hart said the letter was merely a precaution. There have been no escapes, and she doubts there will be any because of three security fences and high-technology monitoring.<P>

   The typical prisoner is in the last three years of his sentence.<P>

   ``It hasn't affected our business per se,'' Pettis acknowledged. ``But we do have some bigwigs coming in, and they're not being told there is a CCA facility down there. We keep it a secret.''<P>

   She said she realizes it would not be easy to keep the prison's presence quiet if she and her husband, Frank Pettis, decided to sell the company. They believe it has lowered the value of their property and discouraged other businesses from locating in the park.<P>

   No new tenants have moved in since the prison opened, and Ohio-based Spencer Forge & Manufacturing has withdrawn an offer to buy a building in the park.<P>

   Spencer Forge spokesman Jim Montrose said the prison had nothing to do with the decision, explaining the building just was not up to the company's standards.<P>

   Bob Swenk, economic development chairman of the Bay County Chamber of Commerce, insisted the prison has not hampered industrial recruitment.<P>

   ``It hasn't been an issue,'' he said. ``Nobody's even mentioned it.''
