   ROCKLEDGE (--) A self-proclaimed minister and crusader for the disadvantaged who himself had been in trouble with the law has died of stab wounds.<ep>
   Jack Anthony Ott, 41, called 911 from his home early Saturday, but could only mutter, ``Help, help'' before collapsing, police said. Ott died later Saturday at a Rockledge hospital.<ep>
   Police sought clues to the Vietnam veteran's stabbing death Sunday. There were no suspects.<ep>
   Ott was deeply religious and often would bring vagrants into his home for a meal or to help them back on their feet, said his brother-in-law, Ray Hall.<ep>
   He began referring to himself as a reverend and started a church in his home that he called the Church of the Holy Spirit. In a column he wrote two years ago for the Florida Today newspaper, he said he had visions of angels.<ep>
   ``One day I was looking at my rosary and decided if I could find people who believed in God and would pray once a day to him, that God would love them and share his powers.''<ep>
   Ott had a longstanding feud with his ex-wife over child custody, had a drug problem and had been charged many times with assault and battery, police said. Additionally, he went to prison several times in connection with stalking and beating his ex-wife.<ep>
   ``He was always doing something [to get himself in trouble], but he had a big heart,'' said Debbie Baker, a former girlfriend.<ep>
