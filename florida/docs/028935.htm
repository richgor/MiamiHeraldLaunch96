   KISSIMMEE -- Henri Landwirth has prospered in business and surrounded himself with prominent friends in the 51 years since his escape from the nightmare experience of a Nazi concentration camp as a teenager.<P>

   But none of his achievements has given him as much pleasure as developing a program that has provided Central Florida theme park vacations to about 25,000 critically ill children and their families.<P>

   Landwirth, 69, is a dreammaker: fulfilling the wishes of children recommended by 350 organizations and hospitals around the world.<P>

   At least a dozen astronauts, scores of corporate executives, a smattering of foreign dignitaries -- and 1,400 other people who have helped in one way or another -- will join the founder this weekend in celebrating the 10th anniversary of Give Kids The World.<P>

   The 35-acre village in this Orlando suburb serves as the home away from home for the visitors, many of them clinging to their last few days or weeks of life.<P>

   Mickey Mouse and Walt Disney World are, of course, at the top of their wish list, followed by Universal Studios, Sea World and other parks and attractions.<P>

   The children, their parents and siblings spend six days here, at no expense, after their sponsoring group provides transportation and any medical care necessary. It is all made possible by the generosity of many major corporations and small businesses. They have contributed an estimated $75 million in cash, goods, services and time during the past decade.<P>

   Thousands of employees from the theme parks and other companies volunteer to keep the village operating and entertain and transport the families.<P>

   The Belgian-born Landwirth, a slim, gray-haired Santa Claus without the beard, presides over it all with a wide smile. His total involvement in the project has made for ``the happiest 10 years of my life,'' he says.<P>

   Landwirth was 13 when he and his twin sister Margot were separated from their parents and sent to separate concentration camps in Poland in the early days of World War II. Their parents died, but he and his sister survived the camps, came to this country and prospered.<P>

   Along the way, Landwirth worked as a New York diamond cutter, served in the U.S. Army, studied hotel management under the GI Bill, married and settled down in Florida.<P>

   He was manager of the Starlite Hotel in Cocoa Beach at the time the Mercury astronaut program began in nearby Cape Canaveral, and he became friendly with astronauts, television commentators and others involved in the space activity.<P>

   Television commentator Walter Cronkite and John Glenn, Alan Shepard and the other Mercury 7 astronauts later supported Landwirth in the Give Kids The World program, and they and other astronauts continue to do so with personal appearances, fund-raising programs and other activities.<P>

   ``It's an emotional time for me,'' Landwirth said Wednesday. ``I am immensely gratified that I've been able to accomplish this and make kids happy. I look on their pale, sick faces and I see myself sometimes.<P>

   ``I know what it is to have no control over your life at a very young age.''
