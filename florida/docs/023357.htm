   FORT WALTON BEACH -- Two review panels have refused to ban a book of black-written poetry from middle schools after a parent contended it promotes violence and complained about expletives and a reference to abortion.<P>

   Steve Powers of nearby Valparaiso said he would carry his fight to the Okaloosa County School Board after a second panel turned down his request Tuesday to pull Poetry of Black America from school libraries.<P>

   A seven-member committee concluded the 552-page book published in 1973 by Harper & Row is a valuable resource that should remain on the shelves, where it has gathered more dust than readers during the past 21 years.<P>

   The panel included a cross section of school employees and School Board member Bert Moore. Earlier, another review panel at Lewis Middle School, where Powers' 14-year-old daughter is a student, refused to ban the book.<P>

   ``I did not find it to be so offensive that I would want to say that the people at Lewis had gone too far,'' Moore said.<P>

   Powers agrees that the book, taken as a whole, has value and may be suitable for older students, but he maintains it is inappropriate for younger children.<P>

   The poems he complained about focus on the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s, but the book also chronicles black experiences in America during the past 150 years.<P>

   The Florida Panhandle paint and body worker, a father of two, said he would reserve further comment until the School Board considers the matter, possibly at its May 27 meeting.<P>

   He has been trying to generate support for a ban by passing out copies of passages he considers objectionable at churches in Valparaiso and adjacent Niceville.<P>

   The book also is in libraries at one other middle school and two high schools in Okaloosa County, according to a survey by Keith Kyker, educational media specialist at Lewis.<P>

   A sampling by Kyker of nearly 40 percent of Florida schools found the book available in 126 high schools, 75 middle schools and 38 elementary schools.
