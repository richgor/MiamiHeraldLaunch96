<m0>   A developer can build on uninhabited Buck Key near Captiva Island (--) site of a Calusa Indian village that now mostly belongs to the J.N. ``Ding'' Darling National Wildlife Refuge (--) but says he would rather make a deal.<ep>
   Mariner Properties Development has signed a contract to buy about a quarter of the 325-acre island to build 32 homes, but company President Ray Pavelka says he's willing to sell the land to conservationists at a discount.<ep>
   The catch?<ep>
   Pavelka wants conservationists and concerned residents of adjacent Captiva Island to help Mariner get its Buck Key development rights transferred (--) for more building on low-density Captiva Island.<ep>
   The conservation conundrum is the result of a contract just signed by Mariner, which reached a $3.8 million deal for the Buck Key tract with owner Ted Watrous of Fort Myers after 12 years of talks.<ep>
   Zoning permits up to 32 single-family homes and such amenities as swimming pools and tennis courts.<ep>
   But Mariner would rather build on Captiva Island, Pavelka says. To do that, the developer would like public backing in getting Lee County and state approval for zoning changes needed for its Captiva plans.<ep>
   ``Our first objective is to save Buck Key,'' Pavelka said. ``We've served it up as an option. Now it's time for the community to act.''<ep>
   But Mariner remains ``in the business to make a profit,'' added Pavelka, who wouldn't say how much conservationists would have to pay for the Buck Key tract.<ep>
   Instead, he says, the more that Mariner is allowed to build on Captiva, the less it will charge for its Buck Key property.<ep>
   Conservationists who have tried for years to buy the Watrous site on Buck Key to add to the renowned Ding Darling refuge are worried.<ep>
   ``A lot of people are really upset,'' said Ann Bruning, Captiva resident and Buck Key visitor since 1944, ``but we just don't know what we can do about it.''<ep>
   Apart from the refuge and the Watrous property, Buck Key's remaining acres are owned and preserved by the state and the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation.<ep>
   Conservationists couldn't afford Watrous' original $6 million asking price (--) or the final price tag now being paid by Mariner, said refuge manager Lou Hinds.<ep>
   But they've long pressed to slow or halt further development on Captiva as well.<ep>
   In March, the Captiva Civic Association board officially announced that it opposes any development on Buck Key or any transfer of development rights that would increase Captiva's three-units-an-acre density limit.<ep>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service might be interested in buying the Buck Key land but not if it means building on environmentally sensitive land on Captiva, Hinds said.<ep>
   ``It would be a shame, a real shame to destroy [Buck Key] and put houses on it,'' said Hinds, who plans to meet this month with Mariner.<ep>
   Should no agreement be reached, Pavelka said Mariner would go ahead and develop Buck Key (--) and feel good about doing it.<ep>
   ``We develop with the environment in mind,'' he said. ``And if we didn't develop it, someone else would.''<ql>
