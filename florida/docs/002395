<m0>   A butterfly's life is a beautiful blur.<ep>
   Most live just a few days before they are eaten by birds, spiders or other insects.<ep>
   The expected life span: two days to two weeks.<ep>
   In that scary world, butterflies live fast. They are born to mate.<ep>
   The Schaus swallowtail female is ready the moment she emerges from the pupa on a May or June day. She'll lay 10 to 15 eggs a day.<ep>
   In captivity or if they're lucky, some butterflies can live as long as 11 months. The best known American species, the Monarch, lives long enough to migrate thousands of miles each fall to mate in the tropics from as far away as southern Canada.<ep>
