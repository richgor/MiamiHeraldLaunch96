<m0>   TALLAHASSEE (--) Coastal Petroleum is again pressing a claim for state restitution for a ban on oil drilling in Gulf Coast waters, where Coastal holds rights to royalties from any oil production.<ep>
   Coastal's claim was rejected in a summary judgment in Leon County Circuit Court in 1993. But rather than dismiss the claim outright, the 1st District Court of Appeal ordered the court to hear arguments.<ep>
   Leon Circuit Judge Philip Padovano began hearing an expected five days of testimony this week, to be followed by depositions and written arguments before he issues a ruling.<ep>
   The controversy is over a 1976 agreement in which the state gave Coastal the right to collect 6.25 percent royalties on any oil production on about 2.5 million acres of tidal lands (--) stretching roughly from Apalachicola to Naples and extending 4.3 miles out from shore.<ep>
   Coastal President Phil Ware acknowledged under questioning Tuesday by Assistant Attorney General Robert Glogau that there had been no major oil discoveries on the lands.<ep>
   But Coastal attorney Robert Angerer said, ``At the time the settlement was signed, Coastal anticipated leases would be signed on the lands.''<ep>
   The state outlawed drilling in offshore waters in 1990, and Coastal claims its royalty interests were rendered worthless.<ep>
