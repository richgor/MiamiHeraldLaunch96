<m0>  Chalk one up for Nancy Reagan.<ep>
  The former first lady was widely known for her ``Just Say No'' campaign to prevent drug use and teenage pregnancy. Critics said it was too simplistic.<ep>
  But in the years since the Reagans left the White House, use of tobacco and marijuana by kids has soared, and pot and cigarette smoking is attracting younger users, a University of Florida researcher reports.<ep>
  Mark Gold, a professor in the UF Brain Institute, said Nancy Reagan's retirement to the California sunset is only a small blip on the screen of social changes that have led to a massive reflowering of the drug culture.<ep>
  Society in general is doing a terrible job of showing kids why they should say no to drugs and how to say no, Gold said in a presentation to the Society of Biological Psychiatry in New York last week.<ep>
  UF researchers working with annual national surveys of 200,000 students in grades 6-12 confirmed the rise in drug and tobacco use that other recent studies have found.<ep>
  More importantly, Gold said, the results show the strong link between adolescents smoking cigarettes and using drugs. ``If you never learn how to smoke, you can't smoke nicotine, marijuana, crack or heroin,'' Gold said.<ep>
  Prevention campaigns usually focus on specific drugs, like crack, cocaine and heroin. ``Prevention activities are destined to fail unless they're focused on prevention of smoking in the earliest years of school,'' Gold said. ``We occasionally lose sight of that.''<ep>
  Just when the rise in junior high smoking and drug use began is not clear, he said. Surveys of high school seniors began in the mid-1970s. But only in recent years, as educators and others have seen evidence of significant increases in drug use, have the surveys been administered to lower grades.<ep>
   UF researchers analyzed the national surveys conducted by the Atlanta-based Parents Resource Institute for Drug Education. The results, Gold said, are comparable to other surveys through the years.<ep>
  From 1975-90, surveys of high school seniors charted a steady decline in marijuana use and a rising belief that marijuana could be harmful. Then the trends reversed.<ep>
  Findings from UF's analysis of the nationwide survey of sixth- through 12th-graders include:<ep>
  (box) Last year, 9.5 percent of kids in grades 6-8 smoked marijuana, up from 8.2 percent in 1994 and 5.8 percent in 1992.<ep>
  (box) In 1995, 28 percent of sixth- through eighth-graders smoked cigarettes, up from 26.3 percent in 1994 and 22.1 percent in 1991.<ep>
  (box) Slightly more than a third of high school seniors smoked marijuana, up from 28.9 percent in the 1994 survey. A fifth smoke marijuana at least once a month.<ep>
  (box) Use of other illicit drugs rose between 1993-94 and 1994-95.<ep>
  (box) Nearly half (--) 46.8 percent (--) of high school seniors smoked cigarettes, up 2.9 percent over the prior year.<ep>
  (box) Only half of all eighth-graders believe smokers run a great risk of physical harm smoking a pack of cigarettes or more daily.<ep>
   Gold attributed much of the rise to ``a permissive atmosphere, drug availability and '60s nostalgia.'' Parent groups to fight drugs were grew strong in the 1980s, but their kids have grown up and '90s parents haven't seen the urgency of taking up the torch. And national and educational anti-drug campaigns are generally weaker, Gold said.<ep>
  Meanwhile, drug use is a frequent theme in popular music, TV, movies and the ``cyberspace'' entertainment of the computer age, Gold said.<ep>
   Gold, whose research focuses on how drugs affect the brain, said smoking gets drugs to the brain just as efficiently as intervenous injections. Fear of injections is a natural deterrent to that kind of drug use, he said. But kids' fear of smoking is rapidly disappearing.<ql>
