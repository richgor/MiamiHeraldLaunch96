<m0>   OVIEDO (--) When David Knickerbocker, a former mayor, turned over a spare room in his real estate office in Oviedo to friend Tom Feeney's political campaign, he thought he knew what to expect.<ep>
   Then the hired guns with computers showed up from as far away as Tallahassee. Maps of Florida House District 33 covered the walls. A volunteer army arrived. A dozen phone lines were installed. There were media advisers, pollsters and more.<ep>
   ``Now I realize that I had never seen a real campaign,'' Knickerbocker said, standing amid controlled bedlam. ``It has been a joy to behold.''<ep>
   When voters in District 33 cast ballots today in a special election to fill a House seat vacated in scandal, they will culminate what might be the most sophisticated campaign in legislative history.<ep>
   ``This is like a gathering of two huge armies and fighting the Battle of the Bulge in three city blocks,'' said Feeney, the Republican nominee.<ep>
   Part of the interest in the race is Feeney himself, a onetime rising star attempting to return to the state House after leaving in 1994 to enter the governor's race as GOP candidate Jeb Bush's running mate. He faces James Hattaway, 27, scion of a prominent local family.<ep>
<m1>Testing strategies<ep>
<m0>   But more than that, the race is to the regular elections this fall what the Spanish Civil War was to World War II (--) a tidy little war in which bigger allies of both sides are testing the latest strategies for use in the fall.<ep>
   For Democrats, this is an opportunity to bolster party morale (--) sagging since 1994 (--) by picking up a district that has been in Republican hands since the 1980s.<ep>
   Most recently the incumbent was Marvin Couch, a leader in the GOP's Christian-conservative wing until he was arrested in his car with a prostitute last month. He resigned, forcing the special election.<ep>
   ``If the Republicans lose,'' said Florida Democratic Party Executive Director Scott Falmlen, ``they'll be really hurtin'. This is an election that they're expected to win, so if we win, it's an upset.''<ep>
   The candidates seem perfectly cast.<ep>
   Not only does Feeney have a statewide profile (--) adding credence to the Democrats' upset hopes (--) but he is being portrayed by Democrats as the epitome of all that is amiss with today's Republican Party.<ep>
   An ideological conservative, Feeney appeals to ``the far, right-wing psycho fringe'' and fits the mold not only of the fallen Couch, but also of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Pat Buchanan, says his opponent.<ep>
   During his prior two terms as a legislator, Feeney was linked to the Christian Coalition because he championed the group's views. In this campaign, he is working hard to shed the label.<ep>
   ``Nobody likes to be considered a puppet for any cause, least of all me,'' Feeney said in an interview. ``I'd rather be a maverick than a puppet.''<ep>
 <m1>Hattaway the home boy<ep>
<m0>   But the most potent weapon that the Democrat appears to have is ``the home court advantage.'' Hattaway is from a politically prominent family with roots planted three generations deep in the district. His father is a former county commissioner; his mother is the dean of Seminole Community College.<ep>
   His uncle, Bob Hattaway, held the same House seat from 1974 to 1982. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Hattaway said he decided to run when he read that Feeney planned to move into the district in the hope of being a part of the Republican takeover of the Florida House in elections this fall.<ep>
   ``I was furious,'' Hattaway said. ``Democracy is about electing your neighbors to represent the neighborhood. It's not about moving pieces on a chessboard because of some strategy.''<ep>
   But Feeney hopes his newcomer status will not be a liability in an area that has exploded with similar transplants.<ep>
   It might help Feeney that the district was drawn to favor a Republican. Its roughly triangular shape wraps around Orlando's northeastern shoulder and points well northward, taking in the cities of Oviedo, Casselberry, Sanford and Deltona (--) all fast-growing suburbs.<ep>
   Knickerbocker, the former Oviedo mayor, calls it ``yuppie-ville,'' a place of subdivisions, Little Leagues, families with vans and moderately conservative views. Republicans make up 46 percent of the voters; Democrats 40 percent.<ep>
   But these Republicans also back Democrats, including Sen. Bob Graham and Florida Cabinet members Bill Nelson, Bob Butterworth and Bob Crawford.<ep>
   Both sides are spending close to $200,000 each, or about five times a typical House race. Says Feeney: ``It's out and out obscene.''<ep>
   Republican women could be the key.<ep>
   Hattaway is targeting them with almost daily mailings tarring Feeney as an extremist on issues ranging from abortion rights to violence against women. Meanwhile, Feeney's mailings to Republican men depict Hattaway as a kid, calling him ``Jimmy'' and even linking him to Ted Kennedy.<ep>
   That was based on a letter that Hattaway wrote to The Orlando Sentinel five years ago in which he said he did not believe that Massachusetts voters should be denied the chance to vote for or against Kennedy because of term limits. Both sides accuse the other of dirty tricks; both deny it.<ep>
    Both sides insist that their internal polls show the race too close to call. Besides, the polls are unreliable, the candidates say, because nobody can predict the voter turnout on a day when most people tend to chores, play with the kids or stretch out to watch the Orlando Magic in the basketball playoffs. <ql>
