AFTER HOUSE VOTE: Tony Valdes, with his mother at his side, says they'll return for Gov. Lawton Chiles' signing of the measure.<BR>

  TALLAHASSEE -- For Elaina Valdes, a House vote Friday meant parents like her will have a better chance to sue when their infants are the victim of medical mistakes.<P>

  For her 8-year-old son Tony -- inspiration for the bill -- it held a different meaning. His mother, who fought for two legislative sessions, won't have to come to Tallahassee any more.<P>

  ``I want her to stay home,'' the West Palm Beach boy said. ``We'll go once more to Tallahassee -- for Gov. Chiles to sign the bill.''<P>

  That's what is expected to happen. And when it does, the plan (CS/S 454) will give parents in Florida twice as long to sue when their infants have been hurt by a medical mistake. If a mistake occurs when a child is younger than 4, parents will have until the child's 8th birthday to file suit.<P>

  Florida law now sets that deadline to sue at four years after the medical mistake -- no matter the patient's age. Most other states allow longer when the patient is an infant.<P>

  In the Valdes' case, they missed the deadline by 14 days.<P>

  When Tony was a baby, his doctor misdiagnosed him as a hermaphrodite -- and sewed his testicles to his abdominal wall. Years later, Tony's descended testicle developed normally. His mother sued, believing that disproved an earlier diagnosis that his other testicle -- which had melded to his abdominal wall -- was shrunk because of a birth defect and not physician's error.<P>

  But it was too late.<P>

  ``This law really benefits children under the age of 4,'' said Rep. Carlos Lacasa, R-Miami, who sponsored the bill with Sen. Roberto Casas, R-Hialeah. ``Some injuries do not manifest themselves until the child is a little older.''<P>

  Elaina Valdes was clearly happy that her two-year fight is over. It ended as the House voted 112-4 on Friday. She and Tony applauded together as they watched from the House gallery.<P>

  ``It's for the children,'' she said. ``It's not going to help Tony, but at least his injuries were not in vain.''<P>
