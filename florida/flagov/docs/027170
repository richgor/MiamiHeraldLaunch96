<m0>  TALLAHASSEE (--) The House on Friday rejected Speaker Peter Wallace's effort to rein in a long-standing perk from special-interest lobbyists: pricey free meals.<ep>
   They also decided they ought to hold onto things like free tickets to basketball and hockey games.<ep>
  Wallace, D-St. Petersburg, wanted to limit the free meals and gifts to $25, but in an extraordinary move, the House overwhelmingly defeated his motion, 82-35.<ep>
  Wallace grimaced in his presiding chair as he saw the vote going against him, and immediately afterward he vowed in a low but clear voice: ``There will be another day.''<ep>
  When the mild-mannered Wallace met with reporters afterward, he could not conceal his disgust. ``The members are too attached to the perquisites of office, particularly the meals. They are not willing to give them up.''<ep>
  Tallahassee lobbyists ply lawmakers with steak, lobster, sushi, beer and wine at lunches and dinners throughout the 60-day session. Lobbyists host a group of House members every Wednesday at an expensive Tallahassee seafood restaurant, and lobbyists pick up the tab every Tuesday night when the South Florida Democratic caucus meets.<ep>
  Throughout his two years as speaker, Wallace has sought to improve the image of the House. In his opening address this year, he gave a highly praised speech saying lawmakers had lost their moral compass and challenged them to act more in the interests of their rank-and-file constituents so they could be judged well by historians.<ep>
  Wallace has seized on limiting free meals as a way to achieve this goal. House members currently can accept meals worth any amount at a single sitting but cannot accept gifts worth more than $100.<ep>
  Ironically, the Senate earlier this session banned meals of any value from lobbyists, except when senators are attending an event with at least 250 people. ``I didn't particularly want to be here congratulating the Senate,'' Wallace said Friday. ``What they did is not perfect by any means, but it is a lot better than anything the House did.''<ep>
  Wallace wanted the House to emulate the Senate, but in the face of strong opposition was forced to push Friday for the more limited step of reducing the permitted cost to $25.<m1><styl>cxon<ql>

<m0>   In defeating Wallace, the House approved, 113-5, a modest bill that would put a $100 cap on meals consumed in one sitting. That matches the $100 cap on gifts that House members can accept. The bill is slightly different than a measure approved by the Senate, so the two versions will have to be melded into one before they can be sent to Gov. Chiles for his consideration.<m1><styl>cxoff<ql>

<m0>  Wallace had lieutenants replace him as presiding officer throughout the week so he could meet with members one on one and try to persuade them to vote with him. In failing in that effort, Wallace saw most of his leadership team turn against him, including his deputy, Rep. Buzz Ritchie, D-Pensacola, Rules Committee co-chairman, Rep. Allen Boyd, D-Monticello.<ep>
  After the vote, Wallace rejected the claim of many lawmakers that they opposed him because they must accept free tickets to charity or civic functions if they are to go. He said the bill would have exempted these events from the limit. He also voiced dismay with the claim of many lawmakers that they voted against him because they think that only newspaper reporters (--) and not their constituents (--) care that they get free meals and tickets to such events as Heat, Panthers, Dolphins and Marlins games.<ep>
  House members typically roam the chamber talking with their colleagues. But they remained seated and hushed when at the end of the day the meal-gift issue arose, because they were witnessing a rare open revolt of their elected leader. Many lawmakers asked Wallace not bring up the measure, saying that he would be embarrassed in defeat. <ep>
   But Wallace said he told them: ``You're not going to embarrass me. You're going to embarrass yourselves.''<ep>
