<m0>  Catholics, Jewish organizations and interfaith groups have sent lobbyists to Tallahassee for years without sparking a holy war within their ranks.<ep>
   But a Southern Baptist lobbyist joined them for the first time this year, and that's causing an uproar in a denomination in which the faithful pride themselves on fierce independence and speaking for themselves.<ep>
   Top employees of the Florida Baptist Convention, the denomination's state organization, hired William Bunkley and introduced him to legislators with a letter <m1> <m0>saying he represented the concerns of ``our one million Florida Baptists.''<ep>
   Bunkley, a Tampa Bay-area Republican, handed legislators a Florida Baptist Convention political agenda that closely mirrors the conservative Christian Coalition's. It said Baptists support legislation that would, in part, require women seeking abortions to learn about alternatives, make it tougher for social workers who suspect abuse to remove a child from home, and send public dollars to private religious schools under a voucher system.<ep>
   Don Hepburn, director of public relations for the denomination in Florida, said that no one at Baptist headquarters in Jacksonville realized that the lobbyist had widely distributed the agenda until recently, and that the Baptist officials who hired him thought he would be monitoring legislation, ``not necessarily supporting'' specific bills.<ep>
   Some prominent conservative Baptists say they are thrilled with the lobbyist's work.<ep>
   ``Southern Baptists are the second largest denomination in the state of Florida behind the Roman Catholics,'' said the Rev. Dan Southerland, pastor of Flamingo Road Baptist Church in southwest Broward and member of an elected state board that paved the way for Bunkley's hiring. ``We need to use our position of influence for good, and the Legislature is one place we can do that.''<ep>
   But some moderate Southern Baptists, who just learned of the lobbyist's activities as the 1996 legislative session is nearly over, are furious and say the denomination employees who hired him and helped craft his agenda overstepped their power.<ep>
   ``The Florida Baptist Convention has taken no polls of its member churches, has consulted with only a very narrow group of preachers regarding its <m1> <m0>`legislative agenda' and is in no way representative of Florida Baptists,'' said Patrick Anderson, the nationally prominent president of an association of moderate Southern Baptists and a college professor from Lakeland.<ep>
   ``Someone in Baptist headquarters has tried to graft the diverse citizens who call themselves Baptists . . . onto the shrub known as the Religious Right. Shame on them.''<ep>
   Evelyn Evans of Miami, a lifelong Baptist who is director of undergraduate education at Barry University, said, ``I'm just heartsick. In our history, Baptists have died to keep church and state separate. What they are doing is anti-Baptist.''<ep>
   Bud Strawn, a St. Petersburg real estate investor, is so angry he sent legislators a petition this week (--) signed by 27 members of his church (--) saying the lobbyist does not represent them and has no authority to speak for anyone but himself under Baptist church structure.<ep>
   At the heart of the dispute: Baptist theology says every individual stands before God alone in matters of conscience and belief; the denomination is decentralized, with authority resting in autonomous individuals and churches; and there is a long-running battle between moderate and conservative Baptists for the soul of their denomination.<ep>
   Bunkley did not return telephone calls from The Herald, but the executive director of the Christian Coalition of Florida, John Dowless, said Bunkley had worked closely with him and with the chief lobbyist for the Florida Catholic Conference on common issues, such as abortion. ``We're the three amigos.''<ep>
   The Rev. Bill White, pastor of University Baptist Church in Coral Gables, said no one should be selling legislators on a Baptist legislative agenda because ``there's no such thing in Baptist life as one speaking for all Baptists.''<ep>
