<m0>  In the final week of the legislative session, lawmakers avoid taking a stand on one of the most controversial bills (--) the measure requiring a woman to wait for 24 hours before having an abortion after getting advice on alternatives.<ep>
  The bill has cleared two of the Senate's committees (--) amended to apply to women younger than 18. But it is bottled up in the House, where Health Care Chairman <m0>Ben Graber, <m0>D-Coral Springs, has refused to hear it in his committee. Leaders aren't likely to schedule a full vote on the Senate bill before the session ends.<ep>
  The one option for advocates such as Rep. <m0>Bob Brooks, <m0>R-Winter Park, a physician, is to attempt to amend the measure to another bill on the House floor. Graber says some Republican lawmakers privately have told him that they don't want to see a formal vote on this divisive issue in an election year.<ql>

<m0>  Watch for a vote on the effort to override Gov. <m0>Lawton Chiles <m0>and repeal Florida's tough anti-tobacco law as soon as Tuesday.<ep>
  Senate President <m0>Jim Scott <m0>said Friday he doubts the Senate will vote on a bill narrowing the scope of Florida's law to cigarettemakers.<ep>
  The bill (S 12) was aimed at ensuring that other businesses aren't vulnerable to lawsuits under the law that Chiles has used to sue tobaccomakers for $420 million a year (--) the estimated cost of smoking-related illnesses suffered by Florida's poor. With this measure dead in the House, said Scott, R-Fort Lauderdale, a Senate vote is a moot point.<ep>
  This was music to the ears of tobacco lobbyists hoping that the bill's failure will lend momentum to their effort to repeal the law. ``I don't see how this can't help the override,'' said lobbyist Guy Spearman, representing The Tobacco Institute.<ql>

<m0> Russian legislators who toured Tallahassee were particularly interested in the debate over free meals. They consider the salary that Florida lawmakers get (about $24,000 a year) to be a pretty good privilege since most of them are unpaid.<ep>

<m0> A legal dispute between the House and the Senate that threatened to derail the effort to redraw the boundaries for a new congressional district in northeast Florida was settled Friday.<ep>
  The House and Senate had disagreed on whether the measure approving a new district for U.S. Rep. <m0>Corrine Brown, <m0>which a federal court ruled is unconstitutional, would have to be a bill or a resolution.<ep>
  Senate President <m0>Jim Scott<m0> said the federal ruling permitted the House and Senate to create the new district through a resolution, which could bypass Gov. <m0>Lawton Chiles <m0>to become law. House Speaker <m0>Peter Wallace, <m0>D-St. Petersburg, said both chambers had to approve a bill that must go to the governor. Chiles sided with the House, saying he would not recognize a new district unless it was approved by a bill.<ep>
  With the Senate primed to pass a resolution redrawing Brown's district, Wallace this week asked the federal court to settle the dispute. The court said the House and Senate should pass a bill.<ql>

<m0>  A crowd gathered around Rep. Meek in the House chambers. But it wasn't Rep. <m0>Kendrick Meek, <m0>D-Miami, who had the lawmakers so fascinated. It was the other representative in the family (--) U.S. Rep. <m0>Carrie Meek<m0>, D-Fla. (--) in town for the 50th anniversary of her graduation from Florida A & M University.<ep>
  Meek, the son, gladly gave up the microphone to his mother, and asked her to demonstrate her infamous battle cry from her legislative days<ep>
  Meek, the mom, was happy to oblige. Waving a black flag stamped with a skull-and-crossbones, she invoked the threat of old: ``I'm going to kill that bill Black Flag dead!'' <ql>

<m0> With hundreds of bills left to consider, the last days of the session may resemble a wild hog hunt as described by <m0>James Harold Thompson,<m0> lawyer, lobbyist and one of the wisest House speakers in recent times. Thompson, riding in a Capitol elevator to the lobbyist-filled rotunda, was explaining his son's fervor for hunting wild hog.<ep>
  It takes one set of baying hounds to trap the hog, then a bulldog to rush in and pull him down. The hunter follows. By the time the hunter arrives, he is hip-deep in water because that's where the hog seeks shelter. The hunter lifts the hog by the tail and ties his two rear legs. Half the trick here is keeping the dogs away from the hog.<ql>
