<m0>  TALLAHASSEE (--) People who work for small companies would be able to retain their health insurance for 18 months after losing their job, under a measure unanimously approved by the House Friday.<ep>
  The House also limited how much insurance companies can increase premiums for people who exhaust their group policy and have to buy an individual policy.<ep>
  Both bills still must be approved by the Senate.<ep>
  In addition, the House approved Gov. Chiles' Healthy Kids initiative, passed a bill requiring the identity of people who test positive with HIV to be passed along to health officials and approved a measure that will increase the number of people treated for weakening bones.<ep>
  Florida currently permits people who work for companies with more than 20 employees to retain their health benefits for 18 months after leaving the company.<ep>
   The law passed by the House Friday extends that benefit to people who work for companies with fewer than 20 employees.<ep>
  That doesn't mean they will be able to get the same rate they paid when they were employed. Workers will have to make up the portion of the premium subsidized by their employer.<ep>
  Nevertheless, the sponsor of the measure (H 461), Rep. Stan Bainter, R-Eustis, said it will extend health coverage to many people who lose it when they lose their job.<ep>
