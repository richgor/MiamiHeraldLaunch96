<H2>Dear university that rejected me:</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
      Paul Devlin is a video editor and writer.<BR>
ACROSS America recently, high school seniors nervously checked their mailboxes. Many found the dreaded thin envelope, the rejection letter. I know how they feel. It made me feel a lot better, some years ago, to send a response much like this:<P>

<P>

   Office of Admissions<P>

   Any College<P>

   Wherever, U.S.A.<P>

<P>

   Dear Admissions Committee:<P>

   Having reviewed the many rejection letters that I have received in the last few weeks, it is with great regret that I must inform you I am unable to accept your rejection at this time.<P>

   This year, after applying to a great many colleges and universities, I received an especially fine crop of rejection letters. Unfortunately, the number of rejections that I can accept is limited.<P>

   Each of my rejections was reviewed carefully and on an individual basis. Many factors were taken into account -- the size of the institution, student-faculty ratio, location, reputation, costs, and social atmosphere.<P>

   I am certain that most colleges I applied to are more than qualified to reject me. I am also sure that some mistakes were made in turning away some of these rejections. I can only hope that they were few in number.<P>

   I am aware of the keen disappointment that my decision may bring. Throughout my deliberations, I have kept in mind the time and effort that it may have taken for you to reach your decision to reject me.<P>

   Keep in mind that at times it was necessary for me to reject even those letters of rejection that would normally have met my traditionally high standards.<P>

   I appreciate your having enough interest in me to reject my application. Let me take the opportunity to wish you well in what I am sure will be a successful academic year.<P>

   See you in the fall!<P>

<P>

   Sincerely,<P>

   Paul Devlin,<P>

   Applicant at Large<BR>
