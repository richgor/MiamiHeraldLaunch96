      Brian Dickinson is an editorial columnist for The Providence Journal.<BR>
ANYONE WHO has experienced a long, serious illness knows how it invites -- almost compels -- introspection. The immediate physical realm of the here-and-now tends to recede in importance, I've found. In its place there emerges a lot of pondering, musing, reflecting on one's past. Not a small amount of such musing, if my experience is any guide, focuses on the many facets of illness itself.<P>

   Serious illness frightens us, mystifies us, throws us off our bearings. It can evoke many sorts of responses, not all of them exalted. How do we, as a society and culture, react to illness? Answers to this question may do more than anything else to shape our medical care system of the 21st Century.<P>

   Within that system, the desirable changes involve more than insurance, medical training, and holding down costs without impairing the quality of care. As much as anything else, the needed changes involve something that no amount of money could secure: shifts in attitude on the part of patients and everyone involved, even remotely, in their care.<P>

   In her long 1978 essay, Illness As Metaphor, the writer Susan Sontag spoke of two human kingdoms: those who are well and those of us who are ill. Her division of humankind in this way is useful. It has been my experience, as a member of the ill kingdom for more than three years, that there exists a wide chasm between the healthy and the sick. This chasm hinders understanding of disease, its effects and possible treatments.<P>

   I have no medical training. But three-plus years of wrestling with Lou Gehrig's disease have given me an unexpected chance to reflect on our huge health-care industry. What I sense is that this gap between the well and the unwell not only persists, stubbornly, but also underlies much of the stress that American medicine is now experiencing.<P>

   The gap is one of perceptions, understandings, expectations. In terms of attitudes, this gap separates the healthy from the ailing, but also the ailing from their would-be healers. Many healthy people have great difficulty in the presence of serious illness. They are awkward, even embarrassed. They don't know what to say to the ill person, much less how to say it.<P>

   That's one gap. Closely related is the gap in understanding between many doctors and many of their patients. Often, I suspect, patients either cannot or will not take in what a doctor is trying to tell them, especially if the news is not good. For many of us, the realm of medicine -- hospitals, white-coated doctors, and strange sounds and smells -- is utterly alien and thus intimidating. <P>

   For many years, this doctor-patient gap sustained a paternalism across much of practicing medicine. Doctors -- with their long training, specialized vocabularies, and acknowledged power over their patients' fates -- were widely regarded as a caste elevated and apart from us ordinary folk.<P>

   It appears that this bedside paternalism fed on itself. As physicians' exalted status climbed and specialized medical knowledge expanded, many patients felt less able (and thereby grew more reluctant) to take a vigorous part in medical decisionmaking. With most patients pliant and unlikely to question the system, doctors, hospitals, and medical insurers had relative freedom to shape the system to their liking.<P>

   During this evolution, over the last half-century, say, patients were by no means ignored. In many crucial respects, America's medical care network has performed brilliantly; during my own illness, I have been impressed (to say nothing of grateful) at how very well the system usually works.<P>

   All the same, I believe that the two great gaps -- between the well and the ill, and between doctor and patient -- inflict needless harm on those who are ill.<P>

   The gaps in understanding tend to diminish patient autonomy, I suspect. Many a patient, plunged into the unfamiliar milieu of a hospital, may be stunned into silence. At the same time, if patients shrink from asking questions and assuming an active role in their own care, they cede more influence to managed-care organizations and other insurers.<P>

   Perpetuating those gaps will do nothing to promote a healthier American population. One way to narrow the gaps would be for the health-care community to press ahead with programs of patient education.<P>

   Patients have a responsibility to gather all the knowledge that they can about their condition. Basic steps to protect good health count for much: Preventive medicine is the most effective medicine. As in other endeavors, knowledge is power. It may not restore health or avert death. But even a modest level of medical knowledge can place the ill in a better position to cope with whatever the future brings.<BR>
