cap <m0>T<ue2><m0>HEY SEE<m0> themselves like the tough gunslingers in that classic western <m0>The Magnificent Seven<m0> who converge on a terrorized town to help its citizens fight for justice. Except that these hired guns are 11 lawyers who have made reputations (--) and personal fortunes (--) by defending victims of misplaced surgeons' strokes, faulty automobiles, shoddy products, or corporate fraud.<ep>
   And the town that they come to save is actually the state of Florida, or more accurately, the state's taxpayers (--) you and me. The enemy: Big Tobacco.<ep>
   This may sound dramatic, but it's not hyperbole. This is about a soon-to-unfold lawsuit the likes of which neither Florida nor the nation has seen.<ep>
   It's a case with many firsts, starting with the <m0>Magnificent Eleven,<m0> as one of the gunslingers, West Palm Beach lawyer Robert Montgomery, calls his colleagues. The stakes involved are staggering: billions of dollars, perhaps thousands of lives, and the future of the tobacco industry.<ep>
   And it may play out in a West Palm Beach courtroom beginning May 29 (--) thanks to something that <m0>didn't<m0> happen in the Florida Legislature, which adjourned its 1996 session last Friday.<ep>
   I'm talking about the tobacco lobby's failure to overturn a law that Gov. Lawton Chiles sneaked through the 1994 Legislature during its chaotic closing hours. That law, though dressed in obscure language, erased the key defense that the tobacco companies historically have used to avoid blame for the tortured lungs, cancer-stricken organs, lost lives, and millions of tax dollars that we pay to care for their<ju>
victims.<ep>
   To wit: Smokers were warned about tobacco's dangers on every pack. The new law undermines that defense. In this case, the ``victim'' is the state, which is forced to pay the medical bills of smoking victims through Medicaid. There is thus no question of personal responsibility, only of whether smoking causes illness.<ep>
   ``Guess which side a jury will come down on that,'' Montgomery says, calling the new law ``a doomsday bomb.''<ep>
   This year, in an all-out attempt to eradicate the law before it could be used, Big Tobacco hired some 35 lobbyists and forged links with the state's premier trade <m4><< End of Column 1 >>< DROP-LEG  < 36 LNs >  ><m0>organization, Associated Industries of Florida. That the attempt failed is stunning in itself&<ep>
   But the legislative fight was a mere dust-up to the battle opening in Circuit Judge Harold Cohen's court later this month. On one side are such companies as Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, and others, represented by an army of 44 lawyers to defend the $45 billion-a-year industry.<ep>
   On the other will be Florida taxpayers represented by its gunslingers, all volunteers. Their pay will come only if a jury decides in the state's favor. They could make millions (--) or zip.<ep>
   This is no small gamble. Each lawyer put $100,000 into a fund to cover investigative costs, and they'll spend more if needed, Montgomery says. He claims that the motive is more than money:<ep>
   ``Every one of us has a story. My father died of emphysema. . . . I was an inveterate smoker until I found myself on a stretcher being carried into a hospital with cigarette-induced ulcers. . . . This is about a product that kills people, and they know it.''<ep>
   Dexter Douglass, the governor's general counsel, defends the decision to bring in <m4><< End of Column 2 >>< DROP-LEG  < 36 LNs >  ><m0>the gunslingers instead of using the attorney general's staff: ``We couldn't have got this level of legal advice without the trial lawyers' investment. You don't just get some flunky out of law school to oppose 44 lawyers on the other side with another 50 back at the office.''<ep>
   The state is demanding that the tobacco companies reimburse Florida taxpayers $1.4 billion for medical care provided to impoverished victims of smoking-related diseases since 1991. Each company's liability would be in proportion to its Florida market share, another provision of the ``doomsday'' law.<ep>
   An ally of Big Tobacco said that its plan is to tie up the case in the Palm Beach court ``for years and years, maybe decades.'' Meanwhile, the industry hopes that a suit pending in the Florida Supreme Court challenging the law's constitutionality will break its way; a ruling is imminent.<ep>
   But even if that occurs, Montgomery told me that the Magnificent Eleven are determined to fight on, backed only by common law: ``They won't wear us down. We want to kick their butts, and that's what we intend to do.''<ep>
   That may be dramatic, but it isn't hyperbole.<ql>
