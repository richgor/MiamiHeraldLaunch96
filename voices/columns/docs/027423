<m1>cap <m0>A<ue2><m0>CROSS<m0> America recently, high school seniors nervously checked their mailboxes. Many found the dreaded thin envelope, the rejection letter. I know how they feel. It made me feel a lot better, some years ago, to send a response much like this:<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Office of Admissions<ep>
   Any College<ep>
   Wherever, U.S.A.<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Dear Admissions Committee:<ep>
   Having reviewed the many rejection letters that I have received in the last few weeks, it is with great regret that I must inform you I am unable to accept your rejection at this <m4><< End of Column 1 >><m0>time.<ep>
   This year, after applying to a great many colleges and universities, I received an especially fine crop of rejection letters. Unfortunately, the number of rejections that I can accept is limited.<ep>
   Each of my rejections was reviewed carefully and on an individual basis. Many factors were taken into account (--) the size of the institution, student-faculty ratio, location, reputation, costs, and social atmosphere.<ep>
   I am certain that most colleges I applied to are more than qualified to reject me. I am also sure that some mistakes were made in turning away some of these rejections. I can only hope that they were few in number.<ep>
   <m4><< End of Column 2 >><m0>I am aware of the keen disappointment that my decision may bring. Throughout my deliberations, I have kept in mind the time and effort that it may have taken for you to reach your decision to reject me.<ep>
   Keep in mind that at times it was necessary for me to reject even those letters of rejection that would normally have met my traditionally high standards.<ep>
   I appreciate your having enough interest in me to reject my application. Let me take the opportunity to wish you well in what I am sure will be a successful academic year.<ep>
   See you in the fall!<ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Sincerely,<ep>
   Paul Devlin,<ep>
