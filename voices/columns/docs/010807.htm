   YOU MAY have heard humorist Dave Barry's explanation of taxes: ``Your federal government needs your money so that it can perform vital services for you that you would not think up in a million years.''<P>

   Just how much of your money? That's what Congress is deciding right now, as it begins debate on next year's budget. One thing's for sure: It will be a sum so large -- around $1.6 trillion -- that it is nearly impossible to grasp. But let's try, using this year's smaller $1.5 trillion budget as a reference point.<P>

   There are only three economic sums in the entire world larger than the federal budget. In 1994 the gross national product of the United States was $6.7 trillion. Japan's was $4.3 trillion. Germany's just over $2 trillion. The federal budget for the United States comes in fourth at $1.5 trillion, ahead of the entire GNP of France, Italy, or England. <P>

   If these numbers are not shocking enough, listen to this: Built-in, automatic spending increases guarantee that the government will get only bigger. According to Heritage Foundation budget expert Scott Hodge, if there are no changes in current law, during the next seven years, the federal government will spend $12.8 trillion. And even if the Republican Balanced Budget Act were passed and signed into law, the federal government would still spend $11.8 trillion in those same seven years.<P>

   Clearly, radical surgery is needed. But just as clearly, it is politically difficult to cut spending and roll back government. While public opinion polls show that Americans don't like big government, they seem to like the programs that benefit them -- and the sum total of those programs is . . . big government.<P>

   An article in The Wall Street Journal a year or so ago told the story of a hotel owner in Bal Harbour. He had made his first political contribution to Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1980. His second contribution was in 1994 -- to the Democratic Party. He said that Republicans are just cutting too much. And what proposed Republican program cuts worried this hotel owner the most? Was it welfare? Social Security? Eedicare? No. It was a Commerce Department program that encourages foreigners to visit America and stay in hotels.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   So one challenge for those of us who want to roll back government is to educate the 64 percent of the American people who believe that big government is the biggest threat to our country, but who also tend to favor one or two programs about which they really care. <P>

   Make no mistake: The idea of cutting spending is serious business. The liberals have wielded power by building on the old Franklin Roosevelt strategy of tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect.<P>

   Bill Clinton knows this very well, despite his occasional rhetoric about the end of the era of big government. Hillary Clinton knows it, too, and is more candid than her husband.<P>

   In the prologue to his best-selling book on Whitewater and Vince Foster, author James Stewart recalls his first meeting with Hillary Clinton. She was angry that anyone dare challenge their motives. ``She railed against the tactics of the right-wing media and think tanks, wondering how they were funded.''<P>

   As I say, this is serious business -- and if our side is to win, we must understand how serious the other side is about stopping us.
