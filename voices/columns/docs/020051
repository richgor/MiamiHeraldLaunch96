<m1>cap <m0>J<ue2><m0>UST WHAT<m0> every parent, counting the days and years to college, wants to hear: ``More than one-fifth of 25-year-old Americans still live with their parents.''<ep>
   That's life in the '90s, reports American Demographics in the article <m0>What is an adult?<m0> The kids aren't leaving home at 18 anymore. We're talking 30 (if you're lucky).<ep>
   A slow economy is forcing more twentysomethings to live at home, or return there after college, the military, or a failed marriage. Some have worthy plans to crash just long enough to get out of debt and save money. But for others, American Demographics reports, staying at home is a ticket to a lifestyle that they couldn't afford on their own (--) without a lot of rent to pay, they can buy a car and a nice stereo and go to all the hottest concerts that hit town. They may even have more discretionary money than their middle-class parents.<ep>
   Seen through our '90s eyes, something doesn't quite ring right about grown-up children living at home. It's seen as a lack of maturity or failure to take responsibility for your life. But perhaps this full-nest syndrome is less radical than leaving the family network abruptly, as many have done in postwar times. It may even be viewed as a step toward a tradi<m4><< End of Column 1 >><m0>tional way of life.<ep>
   After all, most of the world lives in the cozy womb of the extended family. And in American society, it is only since the 1930s that adults who weren't leaving to get married left the household. In 1940 only 8 percent of American households consisted of a single person. Now one out of four households consists of singles. Perhaps this movement back home is a reaction to moving way too fast and too far. Certainly there is something to be said about common meals and shared work.<ep>
   There is also humanity in allowing the artistic son or interesting brother time to find their places in society now that the <m4><< End of Column 2 >><m0>boom days of good jobs for everyone have passed. In today's tight market, it's harder than ever to find a job that will pay the bills and acquire anything resembling the American Dream. This short-term measure could be enough to safeguard the family from a larger future disaster.<ep>
   However, the setting is a problem. The family farm is now a suburban home, and there isn't much flexibility in space that allows for independence to develop. On the family farm of old, you didn't live in the same house but on the same property, and you knew that eventually responsibility would shift from the old to the young. There was no fear that the young would stay <m4><< End of Column 3 >><m0>in a state of interminable adolescence, as today.<ep>
   In some ways, we set kids adrift and push them to dress and act as little adults too soon. Yet in other ways, we encourage them to stay kids.<ep>
   Nor are they learning the common stories of our culture that will enable them to transcend that stage between childhood and adulthood known as adolescence. So says Robert Bly, in the article <m0>A World of Half-Adults<m0> in the latest Utne Reader.<ep>
   What Bly, author of <m0>Iron John,<m0> is banging a drum about lately is his concern that Americans of all ages, not just twentysomethings, are ensnared in a state of adolescence. In his new book, <m0>The Sib<m4><< End of Column 4 >><m0>ling Society,<m0> he says that we all need to ask ourselves what being an adult means.<ep>
   Bly defines an adult as a person not governed by demands for immediate pleasure, comfort, and excitement. An adult is able to organize the random emotions and events of his or her life into a memory, a rough meaning, a story.<ep>
   With both parents working these days, family meals, talks, and reading together no longer take place. The story lines that those under 30 are embracing are from their siblings' point of view, told via the Internet, on television, or through their music.<ep>
   The danger of a society of adolescents is that ``in an actual family, adolescents do not pay much attention to the little ones or to the very old,'' Bly says.<ql>
<m1>The mall ain't cool anymore<qc>
<m2><qc>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   A healthy society clearly needs grown-ups. So what do we do?<ep>
   Those elders among us need to try to connect with youth and help them cross that line from adolescence to adulthood, whether they are living under our roofs or struggling on their own.<ep>
   No easy quest. An article in USA Today last week reported that teens are avoiding malls, saying that they would rather hang out with friends. One 16-year-old explained: ``There are too many older people at the mall.''<ep>
   If adolescence is extended (--) interminably (--) one of these days those now-under-30s will be in charge of deciding what to do with Social Security. If we haven't helped or sheltered them when they called out, will they say then: ``Way too many older people around here''?<ql>
