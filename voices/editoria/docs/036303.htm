<H2>Bad start on restoration</H2>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>GLADES LAND DEALS St. Joe Paper's $190 million price for its Talisman Sugar lands is too much. There are better deals.</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->
hen it's all done, we'll be a different company,'' W.L. ``Win'' Thornton, head of St. Joe Paper, was saying last year. Not only had the staid company taken on new directors, it had announced that it would sell some $800 million worth of property, including Talisman Sugar.<P>

   State and federal officials planning Everglades restoration took note. <P>

   Some 32,000 acres of the 52,000 acres that Talisman Sugar owns in the Everglades Agricultural Area are ideally located to become filtration marshes to cleanse farm runoffs. Overtures were made, and St. Joe was receptive. Politicians scrambled to find the $70 million needed to buy the Talisman land.<P>

   With a presidential election in the offing, Everglades restoration became politically popular. Some $200 million was stashed in the federal farm bill to buy Talisman's 52,000 acres as well as other critically needed developmentendangered lands on the East Coast.<P>

   Not. <P>

   Call it coincidence, but soon after the farm bill passed, Talisman's price soared -- to $190 million. That's top dollar for land unlikely to sell for anything like that on the current market. It's the kind of deal that the ``old'' St. Joe Paper, which once dominated Florida politics and exercised a lot of federal clout as well, used to dictate. <P>

   Florida Sen. Bob Graham, who as governor initiated the state's Save Our <BR>
Everglades program, has said No. So, wisely, has George Frampton, assistant secretary of the U.S. Interior Department, which controls the money. So, too, should Gov. Lawton Chiles and the governing board of the South Florida Water Management District. <P>

   A fair counteroffer ought to be made based on the market appraisals currently being made and on assessments of the extent of industrial pollution of Talisman's inefficient mill and labor camps. There is no need to rush to condemnation. That, too, should be made clear.<P>

   For St. Joe -- the new or the old -- and its shareholders there are risks: At the right price, the company has a willing cash buyer for land that could drop precipitously in value should there be a disruption in the sugar market. A few months ago, Congress reduced sugar support prices and came within a few votes of altogether abandoning the sugar program, which keeps domestic prices higher than world market prices. The Clinton administration is backing a penny-a-pound tax on Florida milled sugar, and environmentalists are pushing a November referendum to impose it.<P>

   Everglades restoration is proceeding apace. It would be enhanced by buying the Talisman land, but it doesn't depend on a deal with Talisman. The farm bill's $200 million can be spent in South Dade or West Broward on equally important restoration lands that are priced right. Talisman's land, in a word, isn't.<BR>
