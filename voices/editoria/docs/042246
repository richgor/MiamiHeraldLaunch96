<m1>H<m0>ow do Dade's public schools rate against schools elsewhere? The Stanford Achievement Test offers a clue (--) and this year, for the sixth year in a row, the news is encouraging. In virtually every grade, the test scores are up (--) still mostly below national norms, mind you, but <m0>up. <m0>Moreover, in the early grades, scores on the two math tests (--) computation and applications (--) top national norms.<ep>
   Meanwhile, on Stanford's test of reading comprehension, Dade's scores are higher than before but still lag national norms. That's not a total shock; many local students come from homes in which English is the second language. This skews the results (--) even though students with very limited proficiency in English don't take the test.<ep>
   The gains in Dade's schools are all the more impressive given the pervasive poverty among children hereabouts. More than 56 percent of Dade's students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches because of low family income. <m1><ep>
<m0>   So the good news is that Dade is improving and, by some measures, exceeding expectations drawn from its demographics. That's a credit to the teachers and administrators (--) and to parents who may be poor but care deeply about their children's education.<ep>
   Now for the bad news: Dade's middle schools, like those elsewhere in Florida, continue to lag national norms. That, in turn, will affect the high school students' <m4>END OF LEG 1 <m2><ql>
<m0>performance a few years hence. Students who don't master highly <m1> <m0>sequential subjects such as math while in middle school likely will struggle in later grades.<ep>
   The middle schools' problem isn't hard to diagnose. They bear the brunt of the crowding in a very crowded system. The earlier grades are somewhat protected by state laws limiting student-teacher ratios there. <m1>  <m0>High schools, too, have some protection, thanks to the accreditation process. <ep>
   As a result, the middle schools are targeted when the school board raises the pupil-teacher ratio in order to pay for larger salary increases than the Legislature funded. The formula: Hire fewer teachers so as to pay each of them more.<ep>
   Thus the student-teacher ratio in Dade's middle schools topped 23:1 last year vs. 18:1 for elementaries. In practice, this means lots of classes with more than 40 students (--) and not just any students: Middle schools (--) grades 6 through 8 (--) enroll squirmy kids in the throes of adolescence. No wonder teacher turnover is highest there.<ep>
   So these test results, though welcome, aren't a clean bill of health. Rather, they're also useful as a diagnostic tool. The prognosis: Unless something is done soon to ameliorate the problems in Dade's faltering middle schools, the promising gains in the elementary pupils' scores could easily be squandered and lost.<ql>
