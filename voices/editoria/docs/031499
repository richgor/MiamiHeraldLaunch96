But a $180,000 settlement may cost Dade (--) and its taxpayers (--) a lot more.<qc>

<m1>M<m0>etro commissioners may have cut taxpayers' losses in the short term when they agreed to pay off a police <m1> <m0>division chief demoted for ``conduct unbecoming'' after being observed having sex in a Metro Police car. Ridding a police force of unworthy officers is difficult enough, and the county's decision, unfortunately, may have raised that hurdle. This may add to the immeasurable costs (--) in money and principle (--) of caving in to people of dubious integrity.<ep>
   Division Chief Jesus Bencomo, the county concluded, had the county in a bind. He steadfastly denied that he had sex with a woman in his police car in the parking garage at Miami Children's Hospital back in 1994.<ep>
   Three security guards corroborated the sex incident. An internal investigation upheld charges of conduct unbecoming an officer for ``engaging in open lewd and lascivious behavior by having sexual relations with an unidentified female in the front seat of a vehicle'' and for (--) how delicate this wording! (--) conducting ``personal business within a county vehicle.''<ep>
   Those conclusions also received an independent review by two Seattle law officers. They agreed with the findings. One recommended a demotion; the other, a 30-day suspension.<ep>
   Mr. Bencomo, a well-regarded division chief, was demoted to major, with <m4>END OF LEG 1 <m2><ql>
<m0>an $89,436 salary but no staff to oversee. Then he sued the county, charging, among other things, an anti-Hispanic bias on the part of his bosses (--) a tenuous defense.<ep>
   Such strong-arm tactics, it seems, were the way to go. By a 6-5 vote on Tuesday, commissioners agreed to pay the disgraced officer $180,000 in exchange for his retiring from the department (--) at the rank of division chief. Three commissioners (--) Maurice Ferre, Alex Penelas, and Arthur Teele (--) who all have a hankering to be the county's executive mayor apparently did not have the stomach to cast a vote in this distasteful issue. They left the dais before the vote, and returned only after it was taken. Mr. Ferre then cast the meaningless fifth No vote. Was their absence fortuitous timing, or a lack of political backbone to take a principled stand? As always, it looks bad.<ep>
   Metro Police Chief Fred Taylor made the settlement recommendation. To his credit, he offers no defense of Mr. Bencomo. He acknowledges, rather, that getting this person off the force (--) for a price (--) was preferable to a protracted legal wrangle. Mr. Bencomo would have collected a paycheck all the while.<ep>
   Still, when expediency wins out over principle, it sends a sorry message (--) to the upstanding officers, to those of less integrity, and to the county residents who end up paying for them.<ql>
