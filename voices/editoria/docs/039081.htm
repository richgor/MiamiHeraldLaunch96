<H2>`Business' in Broward</H2>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>BARAKAT'S CONVICTION The federal probe of politicians has shed oblique but troubling light on local government.</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->
a lawyer convicted of paying taxes on only a fraction of the $600,000 that passed through his accounts in connection with bonds issued by Port Everglades and the Broward School Board. Trouble is, no one at those agencies seemed to know Fields or why he was working on the bonds. He certainly was not among the <BR>
small cadre of bond counsel who vie for public business.<P>

   In trade for reduction of his sentence, Fields has been cooperating with prosecutors, but that apparently raised issues about his credibility. He did not testify in the Barakat trial.<P>

   (The third conviction was of Joseph DeLillo, a former port commissioner, who has been sentenced to 15 months in prison on tax charges related to private business dealings. He was the only public officeholder convicted.)    Another startling disclosure during the federal probe was the information that a lobbyist paid Walter Browne, a union leader and former port commissioner, $117,000 (!) to lobby former Sheriff Nick Navarro on behalf of a company.<P>

   A federal judge dismissed tax and mail fraud charges against Mr. Browne related to attempts to conceal the payment. Prosecutors said that he was lobbying the sheriff while negotiating a union contract for Broward Sheriff's Office employees, a conflict of interest.<P>

   These cases indicate that ethics codes and laws dictating arms' length contracting between public agencies and business aren't taken to heart in parts of Broward County. Even if those laws are difficult to enforce and prosecute, constant vigilance by law enforcement is most helpful-- absent a change in attitude on the part of politicians about the spirit and letter of the law. <P>
