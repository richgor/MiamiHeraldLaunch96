<m0>   DURBAN, South Africa (--) (AP) (--) The body of a Zulu princess who was hacked and stabbed to death has been found on the grounds of a workers' dormitory controlled by the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party.<ep>
   Princess Nonhlanhla Zulu, 35, disappeared Thursday night during a gang attack on a royal residence in the KwaMashu black township near Durban. Her body was found Friday in a soccer field at the workers' dormitory, police said Saturday.<ep>
   The murder is expected to heighten tensions in the region, which has been plagued by political violence.<ep>
   King Goodwill Zwelithini broke with Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi in 1994, and tension between the Zulu royal family and Inkatha has escalated since then.<ep>
   Officials of the African National Congress blamed Inkatha for the attack. Inkatha denied it was responsible and blamed the attack on criminals.<ep>
   Thousands have died in years of fighting between the groups for supremacy in the traditional Zulu homeland.<ep>
   One of Zwelithini's five wives and a daughter were seriously injured in the attack by a gang of men armed with clubs, knives and guns.<ep>
   Nonhlanhla Zulu, a first cousin of Zwelithini, was a direct descendant of 19th-Century Zulu King Mpande.<ep>
   Queen Buhle Mamathe Zulu, 45, one of Zwelithini's five wives, underwent surgery Friday for head injuries suffered in the attack and was listed in stable condition. Her daughter, Princess Sibusile Zulu, 24, was also in stable condition with head injuries and a gunshot wound to the leg. <ep>
   Police said they believe the attackers came from the dormitory. Last August, police raided the hostel in search of weapons and exchanged gunfire with residents, killing eight.<ep>
