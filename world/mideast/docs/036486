<m0>   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (--) (AP) (--) PLO chief Yasser Arafat called on the Palestinian parliament-in-exile Monday to cement peace with Israel by removing from the PLO charter calls for the Jewish state's destruction. <ep>
   ``We have to respect our commitment,'' Arafat told 600 members of the Palestine National Council. The body is separate from the parliament elected in January to run the Palestinian self-rule areas in Gaza and the West Bank.<ep>
   Arafat's speech, which was repeatedly interrupted by strong applause, was one of his most fervent pleas for support for his peace agreements with Israel.<ep>
   ``We want to start a new era with good relations,'' he said. ``We call upon you to change or amend the articles in the charter that contradict the peace process.''<ep>
   Arafat, speaking beneath a map depicting Palestine as including what is now Israel, vowed the process will lead to a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. <ep>
   Israel has said it would suspend peacemaking if the Palestinian council does not change the 1964 charter. But many council members oppose making the changes, especially in light of the crippling economic blockade that Israel imposed on the West Bank and Gaza two months ago in response to deadly suicide bombings by Islamic militants.<ep>
   Reflecting the delicacy of the issue, the formal agenda for Monday evening's 80-minute meeting made no mention of the key subject. The council will meet through the week.<ep>
   At issue are six clauses that Israel interprets as calling for its destruction. These include calling for ``armed struggle'' to liberate Palestine, rejecting negotiated compromise, comparing the Zionist movement to Nazism and clauses that claim Jews have no right to statehood. <ep>
