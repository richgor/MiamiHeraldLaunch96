<m0>   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (--) (AP) (--) Mazal Eliyahu was packing her family's bags to return home after two weeks of shelling when the phone rang. A Katyusha rocket, fired by Hezbollah guerrillas three minutes before a cease-fire took effect, had hit her apartment.<ep>
   Eliyahu, 30, hitched a ride back to this northern border town Saturday to survey the damage. Her husband, Itzik, an observant Jew, waited until the Sabbath ended to return with their three children, ages 3, 4 and 6.<ep>
   ``I could not wait. I wanted to see if I could bring three young children home to this,'' she said tearfully, looking at a gaping hole in her bathroom ceiling, cracks along newly renovated walls and ceilings, and rubble and broken glass strewn about the rooms. ``One minute there is a cease-fire, and the next, I have nowhere to come home to.''<ep>
   Michal Malka, 30, a mother of four preschoolers, said the same blast threw her and her children from their beds. The family was sleeping at home for the first time after two weeks in a bomb shelter.<ep>
   Many residents of Kiryat Shemona saw the last-minute salvo as indication that the U.S.-brokered truce did not ensure their safety (--) although outgoing Israeli artillery fire also continued late into Friday night.<ep>
   Many blamed Prime Minister Shimon Peres for not holding out for a better deal and said they feared the guerrillas would soon resume firing Katyushas into northern Israel despite the cease-fire.<ep>
   ``Not one person is happy with this agreement,'' said Shoshi Biton, a neighbor who had given Eliyahu a ride home from a Tel Aviv suburb. <ep>
   ``In a short time, everything will resume, and Katyushas will be falling again.''<ep>
