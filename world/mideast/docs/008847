<m0>   DAMASCUS, Syria (--) (AP) (--) Secretary of State Warren Christopher presented Syria with a plan Monday to stop a 12-day conflict between Israel and militant Shiite guerrillas and guard against it flaring up again.<ep>
   ``I want to emphasize our determination and goal is to seek an early cease-fire and a set of enduring understandings,'' Christopher said.<ep>
   But the fighting continued, as Israeli warplanes turned to a new target in Lebanon, attacking the heavily fortified base of a Palestinian group in hills outside Beirut after 11 days of focusing on Hezbollah guerrillas.<ep>
   Israeli air force jets hit a command base for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Like Hezbollah, the Popular Front opposes the Middle East peace process. The Syria-based group frequently has attacked Israel over the years but has not been directly involved in the recent fighting.<ep>
   Fighter-bombers fired at least eight rockets into the Popular Front base in the coastal hills of Naameh, just south of the capital, sending pillars of smoke into the sky. There was no word on casualties.<ep>
   Hezbollah said it fired 30 Katyusha rockets into northern Israel on Monday, and the group threatened to introduce new weaponry into the conflict.<ep>
   ``Hezbollah possesses weapons which it has not used yet,'' said Sheik Nabil Kaouk, the group's southern commander. He did not elaborate.<ep>
   Christopher's plan blends Israeli and Syrian ideas but does not include proposals by Russian and European diplomats calling for withdrawal of Israeli troops that have maintained a security zone inside Lebanon since 1978.<ep>
   The details of the U.S. plan were not revealed.<ep>
   Christopher presented the plan to Syrian President Hafez Assad on Monday. Later, the secretary of state headed for Israel.<ep>
   ``We think we have a chance of putting a deal together this week,'' State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. ``Success is not assured. We'll stay as long as it is useful.''<ep>
   Christopher has credited Assad with working hard for a cease-fire. Now he is depending on the Syrian leader to push Hezbollah into an acceptable agreement.<ep>
   Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres has pledged to halt Israeli bombardment of Lebanon if Hezbollah stops shelling northern Israeli villages.<ep>
