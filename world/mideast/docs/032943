<m0>   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (--) To many Americans, the killing of Leon Klinghoffer, a disabled passenger, by Palestinian hijackers of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985, stands as a uniquely brutal episode in the <m4>Abbas<m2><ql>
<m0>history of terrorism. To Mohammed Abbas, the leader of the band that committed the crime, it was a regrettable mistake.<ep>
   ``The killing of the passenger was a mistake. . . . We are sorry,'' he said.<ep>
    Abbas, better known as Abul Abbas, has made the point repeatedly in interviews since arriving Sunday in Gaza for a meeting of the Palestine National Council, for which Israel allowed members safe passage.<ep>
   Abbas, 48, said his men told him they did not know Klinghoffer was an American or a Jew, and killed him ``because he started to incite the passengers against them.'' The body was thrown overboard, and washed up on the Syrian coast.<ep>
   ``It was a mistake and it led to other mistakes,'' Abbas said. Would he ask the family for forgiveness? ``It was a mistake,'' he repeated.<ep>
   Abbas said it is time to forget the past.<ep>
   ``We must open a new page in the relations [with Israel],'' he said. ``We choose the road of peace, and it's a very long road. Everyone has rights and should obtain them through peace.''<ep>
