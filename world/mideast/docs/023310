   JERUSALEM (--) After 16 days of fighting and a week of exhaustive shuttle diplomacy, Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas agreed Friday to an American-engineered cease-fire that prohibits both from firing on civilians or launching attacks from civilian areas. <ep>
   The agreement doesn't end the conflict, however.<ep>
   Nothing in a two-page document titled ``The Understanding'' prohibits Hezbollah and Israeli soldiers from firing at each other. And it does not call for Israeli soldiers to leave south Lebanon. <ep>
   Instead, the deal: <m1> <ep>
<m0>   (box) Allows all parties ``the right of self-defense.'' <ep>
   (box) Creates a monitoring group, which will receive complaints within 24 hours of an incident and then determine the resolution. The group will have representatives from the United States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, and will establish its own operating procedures. <ep>
   (box) Organizes a consultative group, including Russia, the European Union and France, to assist Lebanon in rebuilding from Israel's heavy shelling. <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   (box) And aims to resume comprehensive peace negotiations between Syria and Israel and Lebanon and Israel.<ep>
   Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres also revealed the existence of ``secret agreements <m1> <m0>. . . certain understandings'' within the negotiated cease-fire (--) a deal within the deal. <ep>
   A senior American official later said Peres was referring to a bilateral letter between the United States and Israel that spells out American approval on when Israel could retaliate against Hezbollah's rockets. He said the letter was private (--) even to the Syrians and Lebanese. The U.S.-Israel deal was limited to the two governments apparently because the Syrians and Lebanese rejected it.<ep>
   The main benefit of the deal, the negotiators hope, will be in full view today when people on both sides of the border return to their homes. <ep>
   The toll of the fighting was devastating, especially in Lebanon, where at least 152 people died, including at least 91 Lebanese civilians killed in an Israeli air attack nine days ago on a United Nations base.<ep>
<m1>Thousands to return home<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   Tens of thousands of Israelis will return to their homes, including some which were heavily damaged by the unprecedented onslaught of more than 600 Katyushas. Miraculously, the barrage did not kill a single Israeli. <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese will begin to go home today, but their way back will be much more difficult. Some roads are heavily damaged from Israel's bombs. Israeli planes damaged power stations and reservoirs, which will result in shortages of electricity and water. <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   And some Lebanese families will make one stop (--) to burial grounds (--) before they travel homeward. Due to the heavy shelling, families waited to bury their dead until the cease-fire began. <m1>  <ep>
<m1>Cease-fire's start<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   It officially started at 4 a.m. today in Lebanon and Israel and was largely the result of tireless efforts by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his staff. <m1> <ep>
<m0>   ``We achieved the goal of our mission,'' Christopher said in a Jerusalem news conference with Peres. ``The agreement will save lives and end the suffering on both sides of the border.'' <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   He said the written agreement was an improvement on the oral understandings that ended the last cross-border war in 1993. ``They should prove more enduring and less susceptible to misinterpretation,'' he said. <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   Hezbollah (the Party of God), said it would abide by the deal.<ep>
   ``When the Israeli enemy stops its aggression we will certainly abide and stop firing Katyushas at the Israeli settlements,'' Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, head of the group, said after consultations with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara.<ep>
<m1>Critics of plan<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   But within a few hours of the announcement, criticism had already begun that the cease-fire arrangement was still open to misinterpretation, which could lead to a resumption of attacks on civilians. <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   The most troubling part of the deal, which a senior American administration official called the last sticking point, was whether Israel could retaliate against Hezbollah guerrillas who appear to be civilians.<ep>
   In many south Lebanon towns, there is no difference: townspeople are Hezbollah. <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   Said Kiryat Shemona Mayor Prosper Azran: ``This agreement has nothing new in it . . . There is no emphasis on what Israeli Defense Forces will be permitted to do. Hezbollah will continue to fire at IDF soldiers, who will fire back. Once some civilian over there is scratched, Nasrallah will consider himself free to fire on Kiryat Shemona again.'' <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   But a senior American official said such a dispute would first go to the monitoring group, ``which creates the potential for a cooling-down period.'' <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   The official, who spoke on condition on anonymity, acknowledged, ``No one can guarantee this is a perfect situation. This is not a peace agreement. This is not a substitute for a comprehensive peace agreement.'' <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   Syrian and Lebanese leaders ``did not make any promises'' about controlling Hezbollah, the official said. ``They emphasized a period of calm.'' <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   And the official said it remained unclear whether Syrian President Hafez Assad is now more willing to work toward a comprehensive peace deal with Israel. ``During the last rounds of the negotiating process, one saw a heightened degree of seriousness in Syria,'' the official said. ``But the proof is in the pudding.'' <m1>  <ep>
<m1>Peace process<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi said the most important thing about the deal ``was not the terms but the fact they reached an agreement. It suggests an interest of these three states to contain a military conflict, which is certainly not in the interests of Hezbollah or Iran. <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   ``So this is, in a sense, a victory for the peace process,'' Ezrahi said. ``It increases the possibility of future accommodations between these parties. That is a lot more important than the precise terms. The terms are important to the extent that they make it stick.'' <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah underscored the interconnections of the Middle East peace negotiations. Syria, by demanding that the negotiations go through Damascus, confirmed that Syria exerts control over the Lebanese government and the Iranian-financed Hezbollah. <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   Lebanon and Syria repeatedly called for Israel to retreat from a nine-mile-wide zone in south Lebanon that Israel occupies for security reasons. While the issue wasn't raised with Christopher, Syria considers a troop withdrawal as part of any larger Israeli-Syrian or Israeli-Lebanese peace deal. <m1>  <ep>
<m0>   Peres repeated Friday that Israel has no intentions ``to remain in Lebanon forever. We don't have any ambitions or territorial plans in Lebanon. If the Lebanese government or Lebanese army will disarm the Hezbollah, and we shall know there are not two armies, but one <m1> <m0>. . . then we can have a real peace agreement that will provide security and peace.'' <m2><ep>
