   JERUSALEM (--) Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry agreed Sunday to jointly develop a laser weapon to defend Israel against Katyusha rockets, which Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon have used regularly to attack northern Israeli towns.<ep>
   Perry said that if all goes as planned, a prototype weapon will be tested in Israel before the end of next year. The Pentagon has already tested the laser, although not against as small a target as a Katyusha rocket.<ep>
   In addition to the laser project, Perry and Peres agreed on a satellite intelligence program that could warn Israel of incoming ballistic missiles within seconds of launch. A similar plan during the Persian Gulf war was shelved after Iraq's defeat eliminated the immediate danger of Iraqi Scud missiles raining on Israel.<ep>
   Peres met with Perry shortly after arriving in Washington, just one day after a cease-fire between the Israeli army and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah went into effect, ending 16 days of fighting that left more than 150 dead.<ep>
   Sixteen days of war, it turns out, appear to have done wonders for Peres' election chances. He proved he could be tough. And (--) presuming the American-negotiated cease-fire holds, still a big if (--) he showed he could avoid repeating past long-term Israeli incursions into Lebanon.<ep>
   Entering the final stretch of the Israeli election campaign (--) the vote is one month from today (--) polls show Peres with a slight lead over opponent Benjamin Netanyahu of the Likud Party. But Peres suddenly has many factors in his favor, and not just because of the fight against Hezbollah guerrillas.<ep>
   The Israeli-Palestinian peace process is back on track, following the PLO parliament's historic decision last week to drop its call for the destruction of Israel and the Israeli Labor Party's decision to end its opposition to a Palestinian state. The two actions served as a symbolic start for the all-important final status talks scheduled to begin Saturday.<ep>
   And now Peres is playing his American card: His Washington visit includes a meeting with President Clinton, with whom he appeared at a Sunday evening dinner sponsored by the American-Israeli Political Action Committee. <ep>
   The U.S. visit was planned more than a month ago (--) well before the start of Operation Grapes of Wrath (--) and it was designed to highlight American support for Peres. That should help his image, although there is little doubt in Israel about the depth of the American commitment to the Jewish state.<ep>
   In the United States, Peres may hear criticism about the offensive. All over the world, leaders had sharply criticized the intensity of Israel's barrage against Hezbollah, which killed 162 people and wounded 339 others, most of them Lebanese civilians. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``Maybe Peres will have to present his case about the tragedy'' when an Israeli artillery shell killed 91 people in a U.N. camp in southern Lebanon, said Uri Dromi, the Israeli government spokesman. <ep>
   ``But below the surface there is sympathy with Israel in the States, and we do have good news for peace: the PLO charter change and the Labor Party vote.''<ep>
<m1>No explanation needed<ep>
<m0>   Peres apparently didn't have to explain the tragedy at the U.N. camp to American officials during the latest cease-fire talks.<ep>
   ``With [Secretary of State Warren] Christopher, for example, there are no problems concerning the understanding of the incident at the Qana village,'' Peres said in an interview with the Maariv newspaper last week. ``He was in the Marines, and like any military man, he knows that such things can happen.''<ep>
   In the last six months, Israel has endured some of the most difficult moments of its history. A right-wing religious extremist assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in early November. Four bus bombings over nine days in February and March killed 59 people and threatened to end the peace process with the Palestinians.<ep>
   Then came Israel's fierce retaliation this month against Hezbollah's small band of guerrilla fighters. <ep>
   After the Rabin murder, Peres assumed the post with the reputation of being an extremely talented politician and statesman and a Nobel Peace Prize winner (--) but a leader that many Israelis didn't fully trust. Rabin once characterized Peres as willing to try any ``stinking trick'' for political gain.<ep>
<m1>Not a vote-getter<ep>
<m0>   Peres has had trouble winning elections. He lost a Labor primary to Rabin. He lost to Likud leaders Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir. In the last half century, in fact, the biggest electorate he carried was the Labor Party Central Committee.<ep>
   But in the first three months after the Rabin murder, with the country still in a state of shock, Peres enjoyed widespread support. Then things began to unravel. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Polls taken in the weeks after the bus bombings showed Peres and Netanyahu even, and the ``loser'' label rose again with Peres. But since then, Peres' standing has increased to a lead of four or five percentage points over Netanyahu. That advantage stayed steady during the Lebanon offensive. The only change was a sharp increase in undecided votes.<ep>
   In the latter part of the fighting, more Israelis began to speak out about the extent of Peres' war. But the widespread feeling throughout the country was that Peres had no choice but to retaliate against Hezbollah's firing of Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.<ep>
   ``The thing about Israelis is they don't like to be hit without hitting back,'' said Zeev Chafets, an Israeli author and analyst. ``There was a perception in this country that with Hezbollah firing rockets and Hamas bombing buses we were taking a lot of hits and weren't getting back on the scoreboards. Peres finally came through.''<ep>
<m1>Not in the European mold<ep>
<m0>   Another writer, Hemi Shalev, agreed that Peres needed to show his toughness with Hezbollah. The Middle East, Shalev wrote in the newspaper Maariv, isn't a place for statesmen in the European mold.<ep>
   ``In the Middle East, where hatred is the main pretext for events, the image of refraining from power is disastrous. An Israeli leader, even at the close of the 20th Century, still needs to demonstrate blood in his eyes in order to win the trust of the voter.''<ep>
   Chafets, who wrote a February column in The Jerusalem Report about Peres headlined <m0>Born Loser,<m0> believes Peres greatly helped himself with hard-line positions on Lebanon and with the Palestinians. After the two bus bombings on Feb. 25 in Jerusalem and Askelon, Peres ordered a closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.<ep>
   Even if Muslim militants bomb another bus or shopping center, Chafets said the public won't necessarily blame Peres.<ep>
   ``Hamas' effort came too early. That isn't to say there won't be another one a month from now, or, say, the day before the election,'' Chafets said. ``But I think the public has figured out where to put these bombings . . . And it's not going to strike them that it was Peres' Pollyannish weakness that brought this on.''<ep>
   Other analysts say Peres also enjoys the advantage of historical voting trends in Israel. No one under 60, for instance, has ever been elected prime minister. Netanyahu is 47, Peres 72.<ep>
<m1>Uneasy about Peres<ep>
<m0>   Still, there are Labor loyalists who feel uneasy about electing Peres for four years. Some of that concern stems from what Peres isn't: an experienced military commander devoted to the peace process.<ep>
   In other words, he is not Rabin.<ep>
   ``Everybody wishes Rabin was there,'' said Susan Hattis Rolef, a party member and a commentator. ``But he's not there. So not everyone is absolutely delighted with Peres. Still, no one is questioning his leadership.''<ep>
   The problem with Peres, said another Labor Party member who asked not to be identified, ``is that people do have the feeling he is less responsible than Rabin. Peres talks about the new Middle East. Well, it's fine to have a vision, but there are many elements of his vision that are not realistic. Many feel he is running a little fast.''<ep>
   But as the election nears, Peres' views are less visionary and closer to Rabin's. Upcoming pre-election tests: whether to allow the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank town of Hebron with its volatile mix of Jewish settlers and Arab residents, and whether to lift the closure on the West Bank and Gaza.<ep>
   The analysts' guess: perhaps Hebron, but not opening up the territories. That would increase the risk of another suicide bombing, they believe.<ep>
   ``Peres looks strong now,'' said Israeli analyst Mark Heller, ``but, to put it crudely, this election may hinge on whether there's a bombing.''<ql>
