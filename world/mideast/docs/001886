   QANA, Lebanon (--) Bumper to bumper, traffic on the Beirut highway was almost exclusively one-way Saturday (--) southward (--) as tens of thousands of Lebanese refugees streamed home to villages they fled during 16 days of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas.<ep>
   They started out within minutes after a U.S.-brokered cease-fire took effect at 4 a.m. Saturday. Hundreds of buses, vans and cars crawled along the Beirut-Tyre coastal highway, which was a target of Israeli gunboats during the fighting.<ep>
   ``We are returning. All of us are resistance,'' said leaflets that guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah handed out to motorists, whose cars were packed with everything from mattresses and suitcases to kitchen utensils.<ep>
<m1>Debris toughened travel<ep>
<m0>  Nearly 500,000 people fled north to escape Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon. Now, after living for more than two weeks in Beirut-area schools and other buildings, the refugees returned to villages battered by Israel's air, naval and artillery bombardment. Cars snaked through bushes to go around craters punched by air raids that destroyed roads and water and power facilities.<ep>
<m1>   <m0>Joy, anxiety and pain overwhelmed the refugees as they inspected damaged homes or searched for relatives and neighbors who had stayed behind in the midst of attacks that killed 162 people and wounded 339 others, most of them Lebanese civilians.<ep>
   On the other side of the border, the 20,000 people who fled guerrilla rocket attacks on northern Israel were urged to return home by Prime Minister Shimon Peres.<ep>
   The fighting on the last active Arab-Israeli war front ended early Saturday just as it began (--) with guerrilla rockets falling on Israel. <ep>
   Shortly before and after the deadline, Israeli artillery gunners dueled with rocket-firing guerrillas across the border. But then the shooting stopped, according to U.N. officers. No casualties were reported.<ep>
<m1>Towns back in business<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   Villages in southern Lebanon, turned ghost towns after 90 percent of the population deserted, suddenly sprang back to life. Residents abandoned shelters, moved back to their houses and businesses, and cleaned up.<ep>
   The change was particularly dramatic in the village of Qana, where an Israeli artillery attack April 18 on a U.N. base killed 91 Lebanese refugees and wounded more than 100 others.<ep>
   A few days ago, only stray dogs dared to venture outside. But Saturday, shops opened and people strolled in the main street. Lebanese flags fluttered on the roofs.<ep>
   ``I'm ecstatic to see friends and neighbors again,'' said Mohammed Dakhlallah, a 73-year-old grocer.<ep>
<m1>Excitement not widespread<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>     The scene was less joyful in Shaqra, a village southeast of Qana that the Israelis bombarded almost daily. Returning refugees found downed power cables, uprooted trees, debris of damaged houses and twisted hulks of burned-out cars.<ep>
   ``My tears have dried up,'' Mohammed Ibrahim Ghanoush, a 65-year-old Lebanese immigrant from Africa, said as he stood beside the demolished remains of his luxurious villa.<ep>
   ``I spent 36 years in Liberia. Then I escaped the violence and here I am watching my house diminished to rubble,'' he said.<ep>
   Khodor Ibrahim al-Ali, 66, survived the bombardment of Shaqra but his house was damaged. As he was about to be interviewed by a reporter, he collapsed and was taken to hospital with an apparent heart attack. His condition was not immediately known. <m1><ep>
<m1>Deaths overshadow rescues<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   Elsewhere, U.N. peacekeepers rescued a 55-year-old woman and her 20-year-old son Saturday from under the rubble of a house, where they had been trapped for three days. The woman was unhurt; her son suffered leg and neck wounds.<ep>
   But the rescue was a lone bright note. Reminders of death were everywhere.<ep>
   Three decomposed corpses were found in the rubble of two devastated houses in villages near the market town of Nabatiyeh, police said.<ep>
   A bulldozer dug a 10,000-square-foot hole in Qana next to the U.N. base to serve as a grave for the victims. Funerals were set for today for Nabatiyeh's victims and Tuesday for those killed in Qana. <m1>  <m2><ep>
