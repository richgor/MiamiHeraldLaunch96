<m0>   JERUSALEM (--) (AP) (--) An agreement to end two weeks of violence between Israeli troops and Muslim guerrillas appeared to be taking shape Wednesday. After intense discussions in Syria and Lebanon, however, Secretary of State Warren Christopher cautioned: ```Difficult problems remain.''<ep>
   Both President Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac spoke of ``encouraging news.'' Christopher and Chirac's foreign minister, Herve de Charette, are in the region pushing separate peace formulas.<ep>
   In Damascus, where Christopher and de Charette met separately Wednesday with Syrian President Hafez Assad, a French spokesman said the discussions led to ``the hope that an agreement could be announced very soon.''<ep>
   Iran's foreign minister promised de Charette to keep ``sending signals'' to the Hezbollah guerrillas to accept a truce, the spokesman said. Tehran is the group's main financier.<ep>
   Hezbollah has sought to force Israel to close down a buffer zone in southern Lebanon that is maintained by Israeli troops and a pro-Israel Lebanese militia.<ep>
   In Lebanon, Israel targeted roads and water installations in the 14th day of bombardments as Israeli gunboats kept up steady bombing of the coastal highway linking Beirut with the south. Hezbollah gunners fired 60 more rockets into northern Israel, by the United Nations' count.<ep>
   U.N. spokesman Mikael Lindvall called the Israeli strikes ``a war against the civilian population.''<ep>
   Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri stressed after meeting with Christopher in the Bekaa Valley that instability will prevail ``as long as we have occupation.''<ep>
   In the hotel where Hariri met with Christopher, Hariri said their negotiations were not about Hezbollah, whose rocketing of Israeli villages two weeks ago began the current tit-for-tat exchange. They are, he said, about liberating Lebanese territory, security and a cease-fire.<ep>
   And in Washington, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi said after a White House meeting with Clinton that he was convinced that Clinton wants to make peace, but added: ``Without the Israeli withdrawal, I really can't guarantee anything.''<ep>
   France and Russia have supported Hezbollah in its goal of eradicating the security zone. But a senior U.S. official said negotiations to stop the killing are not over an agreement ``that will get Israel out of Lebanon,'' but that the security zone issue is to be taken up in peace talks between Israel and Syria and Lebanon.<ep>
   On his return to Israel from Syria and Lebanon, Christopher set up a meeting today with Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Afterward, he intends to fly to Damascus a fourth time to see Assad, then return to Jerusalem.<m2><ep>
