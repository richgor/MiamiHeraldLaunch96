   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (--) Throughout southern Lebanon, refugees returned to battered homes Sunday and villagers buried their dead in a somber start to Islam's most sacred holiday.<ep>
   United Nations officers said Hezbollah guerrillas and Israeli troops were abiding by the cease-fire that took hold Saturday, ending the worst flare-up of Arab-Israeli fighting in 14 years.<ep>
   The Islamic world marked the first day of the faith's holiest feast, Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, but most of south Lebanon's Shiite Muslim population was in mourning.<ep>
   In Nabatiyeh, a market town facing Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone,'' several thousand people gathered for the funeral of a mother, her seven children and her daughter's fiance. They all perished in an Israeli air raid on their home April 18.<ep>
   ``Israel said they destroyed Hezbollah. It's not true. They just killed civilians,'' Sheik Abdul-Amir Kabalan, a senior Shiite cleric, said in a short speech.<ep>
   In the village of Mansouri, thousands of villagers gathered to mourn four children killed by a missile from an Israeli helicopter gunship. The children, ranging in age from seven months to nine years, were being evacuated by ambulance from the hamlet eight miles south of Tyre when they were killed April 13.<ep>
    In Qana, just northeast of Mansouri, a mass funeral was planned Tuesday for 91 civilians killed when Israeli gunners pounded a U.N. base sheltering refugees.<ep>
  All told, 162 people were killed and 339 wounded in the 16 days of fighting. Most of the dead were Lebanese civilians.<ep>
