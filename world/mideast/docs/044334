<m0>   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (--) (AP) (--) After decades of violence and living on the run, the mastermind of the Achille Lauro hijacking surfaced Monday to talk of peace (--) and to apologize.<ep>
   <m4>Abbas<m2><ql>
<m0>``The killing of the passenger was a mistake. . . . We are sorry,'' Abul Abbas said of the 1985 cruise ship hijacking, when his men shot and killed American passenger Leon Klinghoffer, then had the victim's body and his wheelchair thrown overboard.<ep>
   The guerrilla leader came to the Gaza Strip on Sunday in a show of support for Yasser Arafat and his peace agreements with Israel. <ep>
   In an interview in the luxurious apartment of a supporter, Abbas, 48, said the Achille Lauro hijacking was a blunder from beginning to end.<ep>
   ``We didn't plan at all to hijack the ship,'' he said. ``The hijacking was a mistake, and there were no orders to kill civilians.''<ep>
   Throughout the interview, though, Abbas never mentioned Klinghoffer by name. As recently as 1990, he complained that while the world wept for people like Klinghoffer, it ignored the Palestinian victims of Arab-Israeli conflict.<ep>
   Abbas said it is time to forget the past.<ep>
   ``We must open a new page in the relations [with Israel],'' Abbas said. ``We choose the road of peace, and it's a very long road. Everyone has rights and should obtain them through peace.''<ep>
