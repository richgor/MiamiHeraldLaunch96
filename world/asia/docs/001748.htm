   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Siti Hartinah Suharto, the wife of Indonesian President Suharto who steered clear of politics but strongly opposed the practice of allowing men more than one wife, died Sunday. She was 72.<P>

   Minister of Religion Tarmizi Tahir announced her death at the Istiqlal state mosque as tens of thousands gathered to celebrate Eid al-Adha or Feast of Sacrifice, Islam's most sacred holiday.<P>

   <BR>
Suharto died of a heart attack at a military hospital in Jakarta, a spokesman for the presidential palace said. She had not been known to be ill.<P>

   State-run Indonesian Republic Radio said there would be a one-week national mourning period.<P>

   She was born Aug. 23, 1923. Her family arranged her marriage to Suharto, a former army general, in 1947. He has been president of Indonesia since 1968.<P>

   She worked alongside her husband during the Indonesian struggle for independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945. That experience was said to have created a strong bond between the two, which was evident in public gestures of affection.<P>

   Suharto was not politically inclined and was known as a traditional Muslim housewife. However, she took a strong stand on social issues such as polygyny, the practice of having more than one wife, which is permitted by Islam. She headed a women's organization which pushed for a law that now makes it illegal for a Muslim man in Indonesia to marry a second time without the permission of his first wife.<P>

   She set up a government-funded amusement park on a 20-acre site outside Jakarta in the late 1970s. Called ``Indonesia in Miniature,'' it includes boat rides, cable cars and museums showing the traditions, cultures and lifestyles of different parts of Indonesia. A lake is studded with artificial islands to represent the 17,000 islands of the Indonesian archipelago.<P>

   Suharto's fondness for children inspired her to build the park. She also took an active part in helping collect donations for victims of floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.<P>

   Burial is scheduled for today at Suharto's birthplace in Solo, Central Java. Besides her husband, she is survived by six children and a number of grandchildren.<P>
