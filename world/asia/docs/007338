<m0>   TOKYO (--) (AP) (--) Saying he pitied ``those who do not know the truth,'' doomsday cult leader Shoko Asahara refused Wednesday to enter a plea to charges he masterminded last year's nerve gas attack on Tokyo's subways.<ep>
   On the opening day of his long-awaited murder trial, the cult leader sat fidgeting through a <m4>Asahara<m2><ql>
<m0>nearly six-hour recitation of about 4,000 names of those killed or sickened in the attack. <ep>
   If prosecutors hoped to elicit some display of emotion from Asahara with the reading of names, they were disappointed. If anything, the 41-year-old guru merely looked bored. Occasionally he looked as if he were mouthing a chant.<ep>
   In Japan, fewer than 1 percent of criminal defendants are found innocent, so many defendants make a show of contrition to try to win leniency. Not Asahara.<ep>
   The cult leader said little in the course of the day, which was mainly taken up with the name-reading. He wouldn't answer to the name he was born with, Chizuo Matsumo. <ep>
   But he did make one short speech, reminiscent of mystical remarks he once delivered to disciples.<ep>
   ``I pity those who do not know the truth,'' he told the four judges, who will render a verdict since there are no jury trials here. ``I have no concern about things like lack of freedom, and pain.''<ep>
   Under Japanese law, the proceedings will continue despite Asahara's refusal to make a plea.<ep>
   Asahara's apparent indifference roused some victims to fury and reduced others to tears.<ep>
   Michiko Hishinuma, whose subway stationmaster husband Tsuneo was among the 12 killed in the March 20, 1995, attack, wept quietly as the names were read. Another subway worker's widow, Shizue Takahashi, raged afterward at a news conference, saying the sight of Asahara had made her sick.<ep>
