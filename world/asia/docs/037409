<m0>   TOKYO (--) (AP) (--) Riot police ringed the courthouse and more than 12,000 people vied for spectator seats today as doomsday cult leader Shoko Asahara went on trial for murder in last year's nerve-gas attack on Tokyo's subways.<ep>
   Fewer than 50 seats were allotted for the general public to view the opening of what's being billed here as the trial of the century. But people began gathering at dawn to await the lottery drawing for seats.<ep>
   Most were hired by Japanese news organizations. But some were ordinary citizens who wanted to see Asahara brought to account for the subway attack, which deeply shook the nation's sense of security.<ep>
   ``It was such an enormous crime, so unforgivable, that I felt I had to see him with my own eyes,'' said Tatsue Suzuki, 43.<ep>
   Armored vans lined the street outside the Tokyo courthouse. Security was so tight that Asahara's trial was to be the only criminal proceeding in the courthouse today. <ep>
   Before Asahara even enters a plea, prosecutors will read the names of nearly 4,000 alleged victims of the subway attack and other crimes with which he is charged (--) a gesture meant to drive home the degree of suffering caused by the cult.<ep>
   After the reading of the names, expected to take hours, Asahara will be asked to enter a plea. <ep>
   If convicted, Asahara could face the death penalty. In Japan, that means he would be hanged.<ep>
   The trial is expected to take years, with most sessions separated by weeks or months. A second session is scheduled Thursday, however.<ep>
   Asahara's day in court marks his first public appearance since hundreds of police swooped down on his cult's commune at the foot of Mount Fuji last May.<ep>
   Since then, his cult (--) which once boasted more than 10,000 followers and had branches in Russia, Germany and the United States (--) has declared bankruptcy and been ordered to disband.<ep>
   Only a few dozen disciples of the cult (--) known as Aum Shinri Kyo, or Supreme Truth (--) remain at the Fuji commune.<ep>
   Several key suspects in the subway attack and other crimes linked to Aum remain at large. Wary of cult reprisals, police in recent days have stepped up warnings in the subways to watch for suspicious parcels.<ep>
   Such warnings were a daily fact of life after several bags wrapped with newspapers and filled with nerve gas killed 12 people and sickened more than 5,500 in the attack on March 20, 1995.<ep>
   Along with the subway attack, Asahara is charged with murder for an earlier nerve gas attack that killed seven people in central Japan; for the killing of two cult members; and for the kidnapping and murder of an anti-cult lawyer and his family.<ep>
