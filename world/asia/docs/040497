<m0>   HANOI, Vietnam (--) Vietnam is reaping a multimillion-dollar windfall from a U.S. program to search for the remains of missing American servicemen, an investigation by The San Jose Mercury News has found.<ep>
   The Vietnamese government rents U.S. military vehicles to tourists, charges fees far above market prices and siphons wages and other compensation the U.S. government pays for finding remains.<ep>
   The abuses occur largely because the Department of Defense, which oversees the taxpayer-funded program, willingly pays the inflated prices and does not track how the money is spent. Last year, more than one-third of the $11.2 million spent on the Vietnam program could not be accounted for.<ep>
   In the past four years, the U.S. government has spent $33.6 million on the Vietnam program as part of the most exhaustive and costly attempt by any country to resolve the fate of soldiers who did not return from the war.<ep>
   Today, with 1,609 Americans still listed as missing in action in Vietnam, the issue dictates U.S. policy toward its former enemy. Although the U.S. government has declared all MIAs legally dead, it continues searching for their remains to reach the mission's stated goal of ``the fullest possible accounting.''<ep>
   Such an accounting does not extend to the MIA budget, however. In its two-month investigation, The Mercury News found a generously funded, loosely monitored U.S. government program that is providing a big payoff to Vietnam's communist government:<ep>
   (box) U.S. government-owned vehicles imported for MIA work and repaired and maintained at U.S. expense (--) $250,000 annually (--) are rented to tourists by a business owned by Vietnam's Foreign Ministry, which oversees Vietnam's role in the MIA program.<ep>
   (box) The U.S. government paid Vietnam an estimated $1.8 million last year for village laborers (--) at a rate of $30 a day per worker. That daily wage nearly matches the minimum monthly wage that foreign companies pay unskilled workers in Vietnam. But many villagers who assisted in excavations for remains said they received less than $2 a day from Vietnamese officials.<ep>
   (box) The U.S. government paid about $1.6 million last year primarily as per diem for Vietnamese officials. But U.S. officials have no accounting of work done by the Vietnamese. In addition, Vietnam is paid an extra ``organizing fee'' that cost U.S. taxpayers $511,500.<ep>
   (box) The U.S. government pays Vietnam an estimated $500,000 annually to compensate farmers for land damaged during excavations (--) an average of $6,500 per site last year. But some farmers said they received as little as $15 from Vietnamese officials.<ep>
   (box) The U.S. government paid $3.56 million last year to rent helicopters from a company owned by Vietnam's Defense Ministry. Of that, $2.16 million was paid to keep three helicopters on 24-hour standby every day of the year (--) even though MIA digs are conducted for only six months of the year.<ep>
   (box) The U.S. government pays $2,000 for ``processing'' each box of remains returned to the United States (--) $70,000 in 1995. No fee is charged in Laos and Cambodia for similar services.<ep>
   It was not possible to trace which people or agencies in Vietnam's communist government profit from a program that both countries describe as humanitarian.<ql>
<m1>Under pressure<ep>
<m0>   Defense Department sources, who did not want their names used, said some personnel have complained to superiors about the spending habits. But the Pentagon is under pressure from U.S. MIA families to find remains and officially close cases, and it fears confrontation with Vietnam could shatter cooperation on the issue, those sources said.<ep>
   The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said no one from the office directing the MIA program (--) the Vietnam Office for the Search of Missing Persons (--) was available to discuss the program and its budget.<ep>
   But the pattern of financial abuse and lax oversight makes this much clear: Much of the money disappears between the time it is wired to Vietnam's Foreign Ministry and when it reaches its intended recipients. <ep>
   ``How it's disbursed within Vietnam is not our concern,'' said Lt. Col. Timothy Bosse, the U.S. MIA commander in Hanoi. Vietnamese officials, he said, ``don't report that to us nor do we ask for reports (--) and it's probably none of our business.''<ep>
   His boss, Brig. Gen. Charles Viale, who directs all U.S. MIA efforts from Hawaii, likened the arrangement to hiring a contractor.<ep>
   ``The central government is negotiating with me and contracting with me for a service, and I pay for that service,'' he said Thursday.<ql>
<m1>Costs defended<ep>
<m0>   He insisted the MIA office pays reasonable prices. ``We are not going to pay unreasonable and unjust claims just because they [the Vietnamese] think we're so focused on this issue we're going to blindly pay what they say,'' he said.<ep>
   He also defended his department's internal accounting. ``Every expenditure has to be justified with receipts and signatures. <m1> <m0>. . . <m1> <m0>I require full documentation,'' he said, noting that a military agency recently audited the program.<ep>
   But only up to a point.<ep>
   ``Once it goes to Vietnam, I certainly don't audit Vietnam,'' Viale said.<ep>
   Many fees paid to Vietnam were agreed upon in 1992, when the Defense Department initiated a new agency, the Joint Task Force-Full Accounting, to expedite investigations and widen access to wartime records. Negotiations occurred at a sensitive time, before diplomatic relations were normalized.<ep>
   In a telephone interview last week, Viale first said he did not intend to revisit the original agreement. ``I can't go back now. If I went back to renegotiate now, I'd probably take a chance of it going even higher,'' he said.<ep>
   But later in the interview, he said: ``If somebody feels that the prices we are paying are out of line, then, certainly, we ought to be going back and renegotiating.''<ep>
   Today, 2,154 Americans remain listed as missing in Indochina. Since 1973 the remains of 431 Americans have been identified.<ep>
   As recovery efforts become more difficult, the program's costs will probably rise, Viale said. Still, he insisted, the U.S. government is ``going to fund it until we finish.''<ep>
