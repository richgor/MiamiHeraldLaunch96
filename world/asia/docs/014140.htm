   TOKYO -- One by one, prosecutors read aloud the names of 3,796 people injured in last year's nerve-gas attack on the Tokyo subways. The widow of one of the 11 who died sobbed quietly in the courtroom.<P>

   After the solemn six-hour recitation Wednesday, the accused mastermind of <BR>
the attack, cult guru Shoko Asahara, entered no plea on the first day of his trial. Instead, the nearly blind guru, who claims to be Christ, gave a speech to the court about ``absolute truth, absolute freedom and absolute happiness.''<P>

   ``I pity those who do not know the truth,'' he said in a soft voice. ``I have no concern about things like lack of freedom, and pain.''<P>

   Asahara, who faces death by hanging if convicted, stood before the four-judge panel wearing a baggy blue prison uniform. The judges rejected his request that he be allowed to wear a white religious robe, signifying his leadership of the Aum Shinri Kyo, or Supreme Truth, cult. Asahara, who once presided over an empire worth more than $1 billion, was led into the courtroom by a rope around his waist, wearing handcuffs.<P>

   In his first public comment since the March 1995 subway attack, Asahara rejected his given name, Chizuo Matsumoto, and insisted on being called Asahara, the name recognized by his cult followers, who once numbered more than 10,000.<P>

   Asked to answer to Matsumoto, he said: ``I abandoned that name.'' Asked his address, he said: ``I don't remember.'' And asked to make his plea to murder charges, he said ``I won't speak.''<P>

   Asahara, 41, is charged with 17 crimes, including the murders of an anti-cult lawyer, the man's wife and their year-old son, and with manufacturing LSD. Although his trial could take years, under Japan's system, in which trials are held for one day a month, he is due in court today for a back-to-back session.<P>
