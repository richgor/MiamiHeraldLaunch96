<m0>   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (--) (AP) (--) A powerful bomb stuffed in the gas tank of a passenger bus exploded Sunday, killing at least 40 people, mostly Muslims heading home to celebrate Islam's most sacred holiday.<ep>
   The explosion in eastern Pakistan turned the bus into a fireball, and most of the victims (--) including six children (--) were burned beyond recognition.<ep>
   Police feared the death toll could reach 60, because many of the 26 who were injured were in critical condition and more remains may be found in the charred shell of the 52-seat bus.<ep>
   The bus, overcrowded with passengers preparing for Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice, exploded in the bustling marketplace of Bhai Pheru, about 15 miles east of Lahore.<ep>
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosion.<ep>
   ``There were two explosions. The first one and then a second one almost immediately, I guess when the gas tank exploded,'' said Ata Dada, a paramedic whose first aid station was about 200 yards from the explosion.<ep>
   Dada said he was helpless to stop the fire. He could see the victims inside the bus, some still alive, screaming for help.<ep>
   But there was no fire extinguisher nor a nearby fire department to douse the blaze.<ep>
   ``We couldn't do anything but watch,'' Dada said, his voice trembling. ``People inside were screaming. It was so horrible.''<ep>
   It was nearly four hours before the bodies could be removed.<ep>
   Another paramedic, Mohammed Iqbal, said 36 people died immediately and another four died en route to the hospital.<ep>
   The ashes of some victims were buried later in the day in a single coffin in a graveyard near the town. Relatives of the victims and thousands of people from surrounding villages came to mourn.<ep>
