   NEW DELHI (--) It's democracy's greatest show on Earth, and it opens this weekend.<ep>
   From the Himalayan slopes to the steamy coconut groves by the Arabian Sea, Indians will be going to the polls.<ep>
   Millions will walk, some for hours in the hot sun, for the privilege of casting a ballot. Others will journey in canoes or on the swaying backs of elephants to exercise their civic duty.<ep>
   And once again, the catch-phrase ``the world's greatest democracy'' will assume its full meaning.<ep>
   Sure, Russia, the United States and other countries are also holding elections this year. But for sheer scale, they don't come close to India, where more than 14,000 candidates are vying for the 543 seats up for grabs in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament.<ep>
   The numbers involved are staggering: 590 million eligible voters, 820,000 polling booths, 5 million poll watchers and ballot counters, and 2 million police and paramilitary troops to keep order.<ep>
   ``This will be the biggest possible election anyone in the world has ever run,'' said Chief Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan, who figures the cost of conducting the event at about $120 million.<ep>
   Some Himalayan polling stations are located 19,000 feet above sea level, and Seshan's subordinates must borrow Indian army helicopters to reach them.<ep>
   In the Modakuruchi district of southern Tamil Nadu, one of the Indian states simultaneously holding elections for its assembly, a record 1,033 candidates have made the ballot, which is being printed in book form to hold all the names.<ep>
   The three-phase election ends May 30, but the outcome is expected to be known by May 12. The results will decide whether the government of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao can survive. With only days left before voting begins, polls and pundits indicate Rao's Congress Party will not win an outright majority in the Lok Sabha. <m1><ep>
