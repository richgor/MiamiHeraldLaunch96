<m0>   SHANGHAI, China (--) (AP) (--) The presidents of China, Russia and three central Asian countries signed a military agreement Friday to reduce tension along the 4,600-mile Chinese border.<ep>
   The signing ceremony capped a three-day state visit to China by Russian President Boris Yeltsin that brought Sino-Russian relations to their warmest level in decades.<ep>
   Yeltsin and Russian government ministers traveling with him signed 14 bilateral agreements in Beijing, including one setting up a hotline between Beijing and Moscow.<ep>
   On Friday, Yeltsin joined President Jiang Zemin and the presidents of Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in Shanghai, China's largest city.<ep>
   The presidents gathered at the Shanghai Exhibition Center, a Stalinist-style complex built in the 1950s with Soviet assistance, to sign the military agreement.<ep>
   The document, the product of four years of negotiations, stipulates that border troops will not attack or carry out military exercises that threaten the other side.<ep>
   It also restricts military exercises in scale, scope and frequency, and requires each side to inform the other of any major military activity within 66 miles of the border.<ep>
   Following the signing, the presidents clasped hands in a group handshake and clinked champagne glasses.<ep>
   But Yeltsin said the agreement was only the first step and called on the parties to begin work on reducing border troop strength. Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev said it was a step toward setting up a common Asian market.<ep>
   China shares a 2,700-mile border with Russia, 1,000 miles with Kazakstan, 600 miles with Kyrgyzstan and 300 miles with Tajikistan.<ep>
   Yeltsin, in Shanghai for the first time, visited the showcases of China's economic reforms, including the city's Pudong economic development zone. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Yeltsin's visit was choreographed to highlight warming relations between Beijing and Moscow, whose Communist leaders broke off ties for three decades beginning in the late 1950s because of ideological differences. This was Yeltsin's second visit to China in five years and his third summit with Jiang.<ep>
   Despite the goodwill, however, Yeltsin did not win the agreement he sought from China to halt all nuclear testing as part of a comprehensive test ban treaty.<ep>
   China, the only declared nuclear power still testing atomic weapons, held firm to its insistence on being able to conduct what it calls nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes after the test-ban treaty takes effect.<ep>
