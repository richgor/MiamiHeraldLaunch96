<m0>   NEW DELHI (--) (AP) (--) By bicycle, ox cart and rickshaw, tens of millions of Indians braved scorching heat Saturday to vote in a parliamentary election likely to defeat a centrist party that has held the diverse nation together for decades.<ep>
   Five people were killed and scores injured in violence at the polls, but the disturbances were far less widespread than in previous elections, reflecting a dull campaign that lacked passionate issues.<ep>
   An estimated 80 million voters (--) about 50 percent of those eligible (--) voted in the first phase of balloting that will go on for a month, election officials said. A total of 590 million people are expected to vote.<ep>
   Many polls published before the election predicted the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party would finish ahead of the governing Congress Party.<ep>
   But the surveys also said no party would win a majority, meaning the president would have to invite the first-place finisher to form a coalition government with smaller parties.<ep>
   Every mode of transport (--) from elephants and camels to helicopters (--) was used to deliver ballots to and from some of the 825,000 polling stations scattered over Himalayan peaks, deserts, river-streaked plains and tropical forests.<ep>
   About 1.5 million police and 100,000 paramilitary troops were deployed to provide security, with polling supervised by 4.5 million officials.<ep>
   Because voting is staggered over several weeks, preliminary results won't be known until mid-May. Voting took place Saturday in nine states, two territories and two island chains (--) about a third of the country.<ep>
   Three opinion polls last week predicted the Congress Party will have its worst showing in 48 years, and that the Bharatiya Janata Party will emerge as the largest coalition bloc.<ep>
   The BJP leadership has promised to fight widespread corruption and be more efficient than Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, who has been plagued by party infighting and a bribery scandal, and criticized as indecisive.<ep>
   Likely to emerge as a third coalition partner is the National Front, an alliance of parties that appeals to lower-caste Hindus seeking power for the traditionally deprived classes.<m2><ep>
