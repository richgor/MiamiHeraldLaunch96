<m0>   BEIJING (--) China pledged support for Russia's battle to halt NATO expansion. Russia stood by China's territorial claims on Taiwan and Tibet. And after a day of mutual back-scratching, the two neighbors Thursday said their strengthening alliance poses no threat to the Western world.<ep>
   A thaw in relations between Beijing and Moscow that followed the collapse of communist power in Russia has made President Boris Yeltsin's three-day visit one of the warmest since the 1950s solidarity era. <ep>
   Yeltsin and Chinese President and Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin repeatedly sought to calm fears in the United States and Western Europe that they could create an Asian bloc intimidating to other nations.<ep>
   But the Sino-Russian love feast could raise eyebrows in the United States. <ep>
   As Yeltsin faces a tough re-election battle at home, he has sought to look as menacing as his opponents on the proposed expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include East European countries and former Soviet republics.<ep>
   Yeltsin told journalists he had enlisted China's full backing in the defiance of NATO.<ep>
   ``Chairman Jiang categorically supported Russia's view that NATO expansion toward the borders of Russia is impermissible,'' Yeltsin said. <ep>
   For his part, Yeltsin assured Jiang that Russia will always recognize only one China and that Taiwan and Tibet are inalienable parts of that country.<ep>
   By standing up for each other, the two countries could be seeking to pressure Washington into concessions.<ep>
   Yeltsin also used his talks with Jiang to raise an issue he had promised the Group of Seven industrial powers that he would carry to China on the group's behalf: an appeal for Beijing's inclusion in a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.<ep>
   The Russian leader said Jiang had agreed to take part in talks aimed at such a treaty, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang later said the Beijing leadership's position had not changed. The Chinese government wants to carry out further test explosions that it says are necessary for peaceful uses of atomic energy.<ep>
