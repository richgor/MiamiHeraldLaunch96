   KAMPALA, Uganda -- A former rebel leader was headed toward an easy victory Friday in Uganda's first direct presidential vote since independence and a new challenge -- whether he can combine economic success with increased political freedom.<P>

   President Yoweri Museveni, whose 10-year rule returned stabil<BR>
ity to Uganda, had 83 percent of the vote with results from half of the 15,600 polling stations counted.<P>

   Veteran politician Paul Ssemogerere had 15 percent, and university administrator Muhammad Mayanja just 2 percent.<P>

   A power outage in the capital just after sunset slowed counting. Final results were not expected until today. The partial returns indicated a high turnout of the country's 8.5 million registered voters.<P>

   The winner will be sworn in Sunday.<P>

   Ssemogerere denounced the election as invalid, and said his supporters had been intimidated and harassed in western Uganda, where his support is strongest.<P>

   ``It's difficult not to accuse the electoral commission of either incompetence or collusion,'' he said. ``This is too unbearable to keep quiet about.''<P>

   Museveni, the longest-serving Ugandan president, restored order and rebuilt the landlocked nation of 18 million people and its economy, but he has restricted political parties and has been accused of being an autocrat.<P>

   He believes that political parties are divisive, and has blamed them for past violence and chaos. Political parties may not publicly raise funds or hold meetings, and all candidates had to run as independents during the five-week campaign.<P>

   With his victory, Museveni will be pressed by the Western donors who helped fund reconstruction to use his mandate to grant his countrymen greater political freedom.<P>

   ``If you don't continue to liberalize politically, you're going to buy yourself trouble, and you put stability at risk,'' said U.S. Ambassador Michael Southwick.<P>

   Voting on Thursday went smoothly in most of the East African nation, although violence briefly disrupted counting in parts of rebel-plagued northern Uganda.<P>

   ``Ugandans demonstrated yesterday that they have permanently and convincingly rejoined the civilized nations of the world,'' said The New Vision, a government-owned newspaper. ``The dark days of murder and mayhem are now a receding memory.''<P>

   Uganda has been haunted by the brutality that killed 800,000 people from 1971 to 1986 under the regimes of Idi Amin and his successor, Milton Obote.<P>

   Museveni seized power after leading a five-year bush war against former President Obote.<P>

   Ssemogerere is a former ally of Obote. Museveni accused the challenger of plotting to return the exiled leader and colluding with the northern-based rebels, known as the Lord's Resistance Army. Ssemogerere denied the accusations.<P>

   The rebels had endorsed Ssemogerere, who promised to negotiate with them if he won.<P>

   There was no immediate evidence of the vote-rigging that marred three previous elections. In the past, votes went through an electoral college that was easy to manipulate.<P>

   Uganda became independent from Britain in 1962.
