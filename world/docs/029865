<m0>   KAMPALA, Uganda (--) (AP) (--) President Yoweri Museveni was headed toward easy re-election Friday in the nation's first direct presidential vote since independence from Britain in 1962.<ep>
   But he faced a new challenge: whether he can combine economic success with increased political freedom.<ep>
   Museveni, <m4>Museveni<m2><ql>
<m0>whose 10-year rule returned stability to Uganda, had 76.4 percent of the vote with results from 77 percent of the 15,600 polling stations counted.<ep>
   Veteran politician Paul Ssemogerere had 21.6 percent, and university administrator Muhammad Mayanja just 1.9 percent.<ep>
   Election officials stopped releasing results on nationwide radio when a power outage darkened the capital at sunset.<ep>
   Final results will be announced today, and the winner will be sworn in Sunday. Partial returns indicated a high turnout of the country's 8.46 million registered voters.<ep>
    There was no immediate evidence of the vote-rigging that marred three previous elections. In the past, votes went through an electoral college that was easy to manipulate.<ep>
   Ssemogerere denounced the election as invalid, and said his supporters had been intimidated and harassed in western Uganda, where his support is strongest.<ep>
   ``It's difficult not to accuse the electoral commission of either incompetence or collusion,'' he said. ``This is too unbearable to keep quiet about.''<ep>
   Museveni, the longest-serving Ugandan president, restored order and rebuilt the landlocked nation of 18 million people and its economy, but he has restricted political parties and has been accused of being an autocrat.<ep>
   He believes political parties are divisive, and has blamed them for Uganda's past violence and chaos. While political parties are legal, they may not publicly raise funds or hold meetings, and all candidates had to run as independents during the five-week campaign.<m2><ep>
