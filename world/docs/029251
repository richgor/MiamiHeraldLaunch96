   LONDON (--) Pity the Thames. The millennium is coming, and with it, a notion that the river is somehow not good enough for the occasion.<ep>
   Among the proposed solutions: erecting a Ferris wheel along its banks that would rise as high as the Washington Monument; encasing some of the buildings on its shores in a ``crystal palace'' of glass; ``linking and weaving'' it together into a new ``blue highway'' by the use of high-tech boats.<ep>
   Pray for the Thames. And consider whether it really needs much help celebrating history.<ep>
   The Thames, whose name was recorded as far back as Julius Caesar, is 213 miles long. It twists and turns through Greater London for roughly 30 miles from Hampton Court in the west to Greenwich in the east. <ep>
   Between the two points, William the Conqueror started building the Tower of London 78 years after the last millennium celebration. It still stands. Not far away, Shakespeare staged his plays. A stone's throw from there, the Mayflower departed. And nearby, on the south bank, is the site of a famous old mental hospital, St. Mary of Bethlehem, better known to the world as ``bedlam.''<ql>
<m0>Parts are shabby<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The complaint is that the river is hard to use and is thus underused. Like the rest of London, things just happened, and parts are a bit shabby. <ep>
  Its banks are not terribly accessible: Tidal rhythms cause the water to rise and fall 22 feet in a single day. Great ugly walls protect the banks when the water is high. When the water level is low, it is a river of mud flats. <ep>
   The Thames is neither romantic, nor blue, nor, anymore, a highway. It's a clutter.<ep>
   The river may be underutilized, as the government's Thames Strategy report, devised by consultants, said last year. But the clutter is not. The Battersea Power Station, stunning in its dark silhouette, was the setting for the recent movie Richard III.<ep>
   On weekends, a construction site immediately to its west becomes a bazaar of the nation's junk. The crane on the site is a gathering place for bungee jumpers, who, for a fee, get hoisted high above the river and then dropped.<ql>
<m0>Uses of a park<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   In nearby Battersea Park, you never know what you will find. One week it was a convention of vintage motorcycles (--) complete with vintage bikers (--) sponsored by Harley-Davidson.<ep>
   The South Bank arts complex (--) diagonally across and slightly down river from the Palace of Westminster (--) is alive with activity day and night.<ep>
   Thanks to cash from Britain's National Lottery, a derelict power station on the south bank is set to become a modern art wing of the Tate Gallery. A new replica of the Globe Theatre is nearly finished and is already selling tickets for Shakespearean productions.<ep>
   So why a Thames Strategy? In fairness, the planners want more people to enjoy the riverside. But how? The Thames Strategy report suggests: ``an appropriate character for the River Thames''; ``visual cohesion to establish continuity throughout its length''; ``a hierarchy of public/private spaces''; ``an appropriate urban composition''; ``articulation and punctuation''; the strengthening of ``existing focal points''; and ``the establishment of new places at the natural coincidence of accessibility and activity.''<ep>
   Luckily for the Thames, no one is in charge.<ep>
