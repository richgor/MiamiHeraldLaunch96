<m0>   KHARTOUM, Sudan (--) (AP) (--) A Sudanese passenger plane, attempting an emergency landing during a sandstorm, crashed in a field, killing all 53 people aboard, officials said Saturday.<ep>
   The private Federal Airlines jet was en route to Khartoum when it crashed at 10 p.m. Friday. Among the dead were 26 students at Bahr el-Ghazal University in southern Sudan.<ep>
   Sand had covered the runways of Khartoum airport, so the pilot of the Russian-made Antonov 24 tried to land in an area cleared for construction of a new airport outside the capital, officials said.<ep>
   The pilot crashed because of poor visibility, Brig. el-Tayeb Ibrahim Mohamed Kheir, Sudan's information minister, told Egypt's Middle East News Agency.<ep>
   The crash killed 48 passengers and five crew members, all of them Sudanese, Kheir said.<ep>
   The jet struck a newly built, empty house near the cleared field, the officials said. No deaths or injuries were reported on the ground.<ep>
   Among the dead was Moheideen Abdullah al-Faqeeh, a retired general who was the manager of Federal Airlines.<ep>
   The flight originated at Wau, the capital of Bahr el-Ghazal state about 600 miles southwest of Khartoum.<ep>
   It had stopped in the town of el-Obeid en route to the capital.<ep>
   The United States and other Western countries accuse Sudan's Muslim fundamentalist government of supporting Islamic militants, and Sudan is on the U.S. State Department's list of countries that sponsor terrorism.<ep>
   On Feb. 26, a C-130 transport plane belonging to the Sudanese military crashed at Jebel Aulia, 24 miles south of the capital. All 91 people aboard were killed.<ep>
   Military officials blamed that crash on mechanical problems. Because few countries are willing to sell supplies to Sudan's military, it has been short of spare parts.<ep>
