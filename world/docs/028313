<m0>   MOSCOW (--) (AP) (--) In one of the biggest East-West espionage cases since the Cold War ended, Russian intelligence officials reportedly gave Britain a list Tuesday of nine diplomats to be expelled for being ``career spies.''<ep>
   The British government warned it was prepared to strike back and suggested that campaign-year gamesmanship was behind the Russian action.<ep>
   A day after the spy flap surfaced with the announcement that a Russian had been arrested while giving secret information to British agents, there was a flurry of diplomatic activity but still no firm word on expulsions.<ep>
   Russia's counterintelligence service presented the British ambassador, Sir Andrew Wood, with a detailed explanation of the nine British diplomats' alleged espionage contacts, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.<ep>
   ``The talk is about career spies, not about diplomats,'' said Alexander Zdanovich, spokesman for Russia's Federal Security Service, adding that the agency had ``irrefutable proof'' of the spying.<ep>
   British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said allegations that the nine were involved in ``improper activities'' (--) a diplomatic term for spying (--) were totally unjustified, and threatened ``a significant response'' if the expulsions took place.<ep>
   Meanwhile, a rift appeared to be developing between the Foreign Ministry, which tried to downplay the incident, and the Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB.<ep>
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin said ``unnecessarily emotional and hasty decisions'' should be avoided at all costs.<ep>
   Karasin would not confirm that nine diplomats were involved, and it was not clear if Moscow might pull back from its promise of several expulsions.<ep>
   But Zdanovich insisted the expulsions must not be linked to bilateral ties.<ep>
   ``There are no grounds to link specific actions of counterintelligence or intelligence services with the general contents and the development of bilateral relations,'' he said.<ep>
   First word of the case came Monday when the Federal Security Service said its agents had arrested a government employee who had confessed to passing secret information of ``a political, defense and strategic nature'' to British agents.<ep>
