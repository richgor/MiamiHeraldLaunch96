<m0>   TOKYO (--) The shooting deaths of a respected Japanese scientist and his daughter in California have reinforced Japan's perception of the United States as a violent society that is out of control.<ep>
   In Friday's editions, Mainichi, a national newspaper, said the shootings ``again graphically reveal the horror of `America, the gun society' and bring back the nightmare of repeated incidents of Japanese being shot in the United States.''<ep>
   The public broadcasting station NHK showed a U.S. map with red ``X'' marks and human profiles over New York, Baton Rouge, La., San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. Each mark represented a Japanese citizen shot near or in these cities since 1982.<ep>
   Tsunao Saitoh, 46, and his daughter Loullie Saitoh, 13, were found shot to death near their home in La Jolla, a San Diego suburb, early Wednesday. Japanese media identified the girl by the Japanese name of Ruri.<ep>
   No one has been arrested and no motive has been established.<ep>
   The shootings have been big news in Japan, which has long been critical of handgun crime in the United States. Many Japanese newspapers carried a photo of a smiling Tsunao Saitoh playing with his daughter in a 10-year-old photo.<ep>
   ``The world should be rid of guns,'' Saito's 84-year-old father Shigezo was quoted as saying in the Sankei newspaper.<ep>
   Another national paper, the Asahi Shimbun, wrote in a story from New York that while the U.S. media were following the case closely, Americans are accustomed to gunplay and have little interest in the La Jolla case.<ep>
   In Japan, gun ownership is illegal for almost all civilians, and the prevalence of firearms in American culture is perplexing to many Japanese. Last year, there were 168 shootings nationwide in Japan, resulting in 34 deaths in the country of 125 million, police said.<ep>
   In 1994, the last year for which a full set of statistics is available, there were 15,456 shooting murders in the United States, a country of 260 million. This figure does not include accidental shootings, and there is no readily available statistic for the number of total shootings nationwide.<ep>
   Still, most media coverage so far has focused on the facts of the crime and Saitoh's career as an academic. There has been little of the emotional criticism of the United States as a ``sick'' society that has often followed previous shooting deaths of Japanese in the United States.<ep>
   Such sentiments peaked in October 1992, when 16-year-old Yoshihiro Hattori was shot and killed by a homeowner in Baton Rouge when he and a friend showed up at the wrong door for a Halloween party.<ep>
   Saitoh, a Japanese citizen with permanent residency status in the United States, was an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego. He was a leading Alzheimer's disease researcher who had identified a new protein that accumulates in the brains of patients afflicted with the degenerative disorder.<ep>
