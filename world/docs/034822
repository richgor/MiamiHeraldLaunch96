<m0>   MONROVIA, Liberia (--) (AP) (--) Rival factions battled fiercely Wednesday in the streets of the Liberian capital, pounding each other with heavy machine guns and hand grenades as peace talks collapsed.<ep>
   The talks in nearby Ghana were called off after most West African leaders failed to show up. Even before Ghana's foreign minister announced the cancellation, there had been doubts that the summit would succeed because Liberian warlords Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah refused to attend.<ep>
   In Monrovia, aid workers warned that cholera could spread throughout the capital unless civilians quickly get fresh drinking water.<ep>
   ``We are very concerned. There are water problems all over the city,'' said Eric Thomas of Doctors Without Borders. Like other relief agencies, it evacuated its foreign workers after fighting engulfed Monrovia on April 6. Thomas and four others recently returned.<ep>
   ``We have had problems with fighters following their wounded into hospital and emergency wards,'' Thomas said by telephone after the agencies appealed to the factions to let them work in peace.<ep>
   After relative calm Tuesday, fighting erupted early Wednesday and quickly moved into the Mamba Point diplomatic district, where bullets whizzed down deserted streets just blocks from the U.S. Embassy.<ep>
   The bloodshed has forced tens of thousands of Liberians to flee.<ep>
   One boat, carrying an estimated 6,000 refugees, was taking on water off Ivory Coast on Wednesday but was refused entry by that country, which already houses 350,000 Liberian refugees.<ep>
