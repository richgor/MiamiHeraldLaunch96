   HAIBARA, Japan (--) Promising a taste that will linger for a lifetime, Isaku Watanabe fills a small pot with the best new tea of spring. Then he serves the tea by telling his guests not to drink it.<ep>
   ``Lick it,'' he commands. Roll it down the tongue to savor the subtle, even melancholy, blend of sweetness and faint bite, the gentle grassy scent. Then ponder the ``essence of green.''<ep>
   ``If you gulp it down,'' he declares, ``you cannot experience green tea.''<ep>
   Watanabe, president of Kisakuen, a leading producer in Japan's green tea kingdom of Shizuoka prefecture south of Tokyo, has reason to be rhapsodic these days. A new study by U.S. and Chinese researchers shows that drinking green tea reduces the risk of stomach cancer by as much as half.<ep>
   The study of Shanghai residents by the National Cancer Institute and Shanghai Cancer Institute, now under review for publication, follows their 1994 joint study that found green tea consumption cut the risk of developing esophageal cancer by up to 60 percent.<ep>
   In Japan, the brew's perceived benefits have been praised ever since it was introduced from China in the Ninth Century. Eisai, the founder of Japanese Zen Buddhism, extolled it in his 1211 tome, <m0>Drink Tea and Prolong Life.<m0> And numerous studies have indicated protective effects against everything from cancer to tooth decay.<ep>
   For thousands of years, the simple drink has also inspired poetry and philosophy: Chinese aristocrats worshiped this ``froth of liquid jade,'' and Japanese masters perfected the fabled tea ceremony.<ep>
   In the past five years, international research on green tea has proliferated, stirring excitement (--) and visions of new market opportunities (--) among Watanabe and other growers here. Shizuoka, an idyllic area of clear water and emerald hills, produces half of Japan's annual tea harvest of 86,000 tons.<ep>
   Yet few people outside Japan and China drink it regularly; black tea accounts for 80 percent of world tea consumption, although there is no evidence it has the same health benefits. Growers here hope the favorable research will take green tea global.<ep>
   Since the 1994 Shanghai study, at least three other studies have been conducted on green tea, and they consistently indicate a protective effect, said Joseph McLaughlin, the lead NCI researcher on the two cancer studies who now heads the private International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Md.<ep>
   No one yet knows why green tea could protect health. But most research is focused on compounds known as polyphenols, which are believed to combat free radicals, a potentially destructive form of oxygen thought to cause cancer by damaging healthy DNA, McLaughlin said.<ep>
   However, he said the recent failure of beta carotene to protect against lung cancer should caution researchers trying to determine which compound out of hundreds may be the protective factor in green tea. He said many more studies are necessary, including a random clinical trial that could take a minimum of five years and cost a few million dollars.<ep>
   Still, McLaughlin said, the field holds promise.<ep>
   ``Green tea is getting into the category of fruits and vegetables,'' he said. ``Clearly, a high consumption of fruits and vegetables protects individuals against cancer, and green tea could also be an item that could protect people from certain cancers.''<ep>
   The U.S. National Institutes of Health, meanwhile, is studying green tea as one of about 40 foods thought to fight disease, along with garlic, carrots, soy, cranberry juice and licorice.<ep>
