<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) After a long investigation, Secretary of State Warren Christopher decided Friday against imposing economic sanctions on China in the sale of nuclear technology to Pakistan.<ep>
  The decision, announced at the State Department, was based on the Chinese government's claim that it did not know <m4>Christopher<m2><ql>
<m0>the technology had been sold by a Chinese company. China also assured the United States it would guard against violations of U.S. laws designed to curb the proliferation of nuclear technology.<ep>
   At issue was the transfer to Pakistan of ring magnets, which are needed to enrich uranium.<ep>
   Christopher found there was an insufficient basis to punish China under U.S. law, said Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman. The decision followed months of painful deliberation as the administration tried to maintain good relations with Beijing.<ep>
   Burns said China provided ``clarifications and assurances'' at a meeting between Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Christopher in the Netherlands on April 19 and in other discussions.<ep>
   As a result, Burns said, the Export-Import Bank of the United States would continue to accept credit applications from American firms seeking to do business in China. Up to $10 billion in loans were suspended last month in the midst of the administration's review.<ep>
   President Clinton reviewed the China issue with Christopher and his other foreign-policy advisers at the White House on Wednesday and ``approved of the direction the secretary was headed,'' White House press secretary Mike McCurry said.<ep>
   Under U.S. law, ``willful'' aid to a nuclear weapons program would require stiff penalties.<ep>
   The administration's decision was based on an assurance by China that it ``will not provide assistance to unsafe nuclear facilities,'' Burns said. China's commitment will be announced today in Beijing, he said.<ep>
   The decision to refrain from imposing economic sanctions over the issue of nuclear proliferation came only two days after the White House made it clear that it was prepared to impose stiff trade sanctions in a separate dispute involving copyright piracy.<ep>
