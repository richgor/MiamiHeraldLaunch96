   MONROVIA, Liberia -- (AP) -- A top warlord called for a cease-fire Monday, but young street fighters kept up their territorial battles in the looted, torched capital of Monrovia, even dragging Marines into the fighting.<P>

   The Marines fired on militiamen shooting outside the American Embassy after the gunmen fired in the direction of the embassy, U.S. military officials said. It was unclear whether the Liberians were directing their gunfire at the compound or at opponents outside.<P>

   No one was injured in the clash. Marines killed two Liberians in a similar confrontation last week.<P>

   The United States has ferried more than 2,100 people to safety from the embassy compound. Another 10,000 Liberians have sought shelter from the mayhem in a separate U.S. residential complex.<P>

   Charles Taylor, head of one of the militia groups that have ravaged Monrovia in a month of bloodshed, ordered his loyalists to lay down their guns at noon Monday, but acknowledged it would take time for his command to hit the streets.<P>

   ``We are serious about this,'' Taylor said. ``[But] even up to 6 p.m., we should expect that small-arms fire will be heard, especially around the main military barracks.''<P>

   In fact, hundreds of his militiamen and allies continued to pour into the city center Monday to increase their manpower around the besieged military training camp at the center of the battles.<P>

   The camp, held by fighters loyal to Taylor's rival, Roosevelt Johnson, has been besieged since April 6.<P>

   Several rocket-propelled grenades slammed into the military camp Monday, and small-arms fire between the two sides kept up even after the noon cease-fire deadline. Johnson's fighters are determined to hold the camp even though their leader was evacuated out of the country Friday by American troops.<P>

   Taylor said West African peacekeepers had been ordered to enter the military camp to disarm Johnson's fighters.<P>

   ``The holding of the cease-fire declared today is dependent on the complete disarmament of forces in the barracks by peacekeeping forces,'' Taylor said.<P>

   But the peacekeepers, who killed two of Taylor's fighters in clashes Sunday, have previously refused to get involved in disarming fighters, and it was doubtful they would begin to do so now.
