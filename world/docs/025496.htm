   TABA, Egypt -- (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians pledged Monday that their talks on a final peace settlement would lead to a ``future devoid of terror and violence'' -- but the negotiations still became entangled in old disputes and recriminations.<P>

   The two sides ended two days of formal negotiations, but the meetings were largely a symbolic gesture to start the ``final status'' talks on time under earlier agreements. Three years have been allotted for the negotiations.<P>

   The main argument was over Hebron, the last West Bank city occupied by Israeli troops and the only one where Jewish settlers live among Palestinians. Israel was to have pulled out of Hebron in March but reneged after Palestinian suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel.<P>

   The city was not even on the agenda of the ``final status'' talks that opened Sunday to end the century-long conflict. Hebron was supposed to have been old business, solved in an earlier agreement.<P>

   But chief negotiators Uri Savir of Israel and Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian team said Hebron had come up, along with persistent violence by Palestinians opposed to peacemaking.<P>

   The two teams said they would negotiate on the basis of the land-for-peace formula set out in their original declaration of peace principles signed on the White House lawn in 1993.<P>

   No real progress is expected before Israel's May 29 national elections, where Prime Minister Shimon Peres faces a stiff challenge from Benjamin Netanyahu, a hard-liner on the negotiations with the Palestinians.<P>

   Palestinians are afraid Netanyahu would not pull back troops from Hebron, where 450 militant Jewish settlers live among 94,000 Palestinians. That's why they're pushing for it now and for Israel to keep pledges to free Palestinian prisoners and ensure safe passage between the West Bank and Gaza, separated by Israeli territory.<P>

   After four hours of private meetings with Savir, Abbas said Monday he believed an understanding could be reached on Hebron.<P>

   For his part, Savir said Israel is ``fully committed to the agreement regarding Hebron.''<P>

   In a related development, Ariel Sharon, one of the most powerful figures in the opposition Likud Party, said Monday that his party must not accept the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy agreements.<P>

   Sharon's position differs sharply from the line taken by Likud leader Netanyahu, who, in a move to win over centrist voters, has said he accepted the facts created by the peace agreements and would consider meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.<P>

   Sharon's remarks are significant because he will probably help set government policy in the event of a Likud victory.
