<m0>   MONROVIA, Liberia (--) (AP) (--) Ghoulish reminders abounded Tuesday of how shaky past truces have been in Liberia's rain-drenched capital: a severed head on a table in the street; cholera patients sprawled on the ground; polio victims limping from a battle zone in search of a new home.<ep>
   It was the eve of peace talks in Ghana, and the ravaged city of Monrovia was mostly calm as fighters appeared to heed militia leader Charles Taylor's call for a cease-fire. But there were clashes along a bridge leading into central Monrovia, and the thunder of three shells broke the predawn silence.<ep>
   At the United Nations in New York, spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said her sources in Monrovia spoke of continued shelling around a military barracks held by Taylor's rivals.<ep>
   ``We have also been receiving disturbing reports of brutal human rights abuses by the fighters targeting civilians, including gang rape,'' Foa said.<ep>
   Nevertheless, thousands of Liberians were out on the streets of the capital Tuesday, enjoying a respite after eight days of fierce fighting.<ep>
   ``There has been a relative calm, so we pray and hope that things will come to a standstill,'' said Emmanuel Harris, who led about 50 disabled civilians through the tense streets of the Mamba Point diplomatic neighborhood to search for food, water and new housing.<ep>
   Using everything from gearshifts to tire irons as crutches, or simply dragging their wasted limbs behind them, the crowd made its way to the U.S. Embassy and received promises of assistance in finding new living quarters.<ep>
   Taylor called a cease-fire for his men Monday, four days after Johnson urged a truce. Johnson was evacuated out of the country last Friday by American troops.<ql>
