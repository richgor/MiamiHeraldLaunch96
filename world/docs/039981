<m0>   NEW DELHI (--) (AP) (--) As officials began counting millions of ballots by hand, a Hindu opposition party put out feelers to smaller parties Wednesday about forming a coalition to replace the long-governing Congress Party.<ep>
   Early trends confirmed the conclusions of an exit poll, which showed Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's Congress Party doing worse than ever before. Congress may even lose its place as the largest party in Parliament for the first time since 1977.<ep>
   The party expected to win the most votes is the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which advocates nuclear power, a get-tough policy toward Islamic Pakistan and fewer special rights for India's Muslim minority.<ep>
   No party, however, is expected to win a majority in the elections, and weeks of political uncertainty and jockeying for power lie ahead.<ep>
   One-third of India's 590 million voters could vote Tuesday in the third round of the monthlong election. Voting booths were set up everywhere, from the shadow of towering office blocks in Bombay, India's western financial center, to heat-seared villages in the arid south.<ep>

<m0>   Police reported Wednesday that 20 people were killed Tuesday in election-related violence, including five police officers who died in a land mine explosion. In all, 90 people have died in election-related violence.<ep>
   In hundreds of counting centers Wednesday, election officials broke the wax seals on ballot boxes and tediously unfolded newspaper-size ballots to begin tallying an estimated 300 million votes. A clear picture was not expected to emerge before Friday.<ep>
   With 220 constituencies reporting partial results, Congress was leading in 90 and the BJP was ahead in 53. Running third was the National Front, an alliance of leftist, low-caste and regional parties, which had 17 seats. The rest went to regional parties and independents.<ep>
   But the trends showed Congress trailing in 59 seats that it had won in the 1991 election, while the BJP and the National Front both showed gains, the state-run television reported.<ep>

<m0>   In the first race where a result was declared, a former member of Rao's Cabinet, B. Shankaranand, lost his seat in the southern state of Karnataka to a contender from the National Front.<ep>
   The exit poll predicted the Hindu party will overtake Congress for the first time in Parliament's 545-seat lower house. The National Front was running third.<ep>
   If that poll runs true, the Hindu party would control just 35 percent of the legislature, and would need allies to govern.<ep>
   But the National Front and other large parties have said they will not join the Bharatiya Janata Party, which they perceive as anti-Muslim and accuse of provoking Hindu-Muslim riots in 1992 that killed 2,000 people.<ep>
   With that in mind, the Hindu party was looking elsewhere.<ep>
   ``The Bharatiya Janata Party is drawing up a common minimum program to negotiate with regional parties,'' said K.R. Malkani, the party spokesman.<ep>
   Malkani said his party was looking at possible alliances with regional parties in the eastern state of Assam, in Andhra Pradesh in the south, and in Punjab in the north.<ep>
   He also said the rout of Congress could lead to a split, with some breakaway Congress lawmakers possibly joining a government led by his party.<ep>
