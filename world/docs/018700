   AYODHYA, India (--) Nothing remains of the old Muslim mosque in this city holy to Hindus, where monkeys and sacred cows roam the streets freely.<ep>
   In its place stands a large pink tent, a makeshift Hindu temple to the deity Lord Ram that is guarded like a maximum-security prison. Hundreds of special police with rifles surround the site where Hindus believe Ram was born, and it is fortified with security cameras, watchtowers, floodlights and 20-foot barbed wire fences.<ep>
   The high security is a guard against more of the explosive violence that has turned Ayodhya into a symbol of the religious tensions that smolder beneath the surface of Indian society.<ep>
   A mob of Hindu zealots stormed the mosque here in 1992 and reduced the 16th-century building to a pile of rubble. The destruction touched off Hindu-Muslim rioting across the country that left 3,000 dead.<ep>
   The ultra-nationalist Hindu political party that incited the destruction of the mosque has almost certainly been the big winner in monthlong national elections.<ep>
   The very name of the party is indissolubly associated with <m0>Hindutva,<m0> or the Hindu way of life. Party leaders call for ``one nation, one people, one culture.''<ep>
   That is a controversial platform in a nation that is home to 105 million Muslims. Though they are only 10 percent of the population, there are more Muslims in India than in any single nation in the Middle East.<ep>
   The powerful emergence of the BJP has raised fears that a wave of Hindu fundamentalism could sweep the country.<ep>
   The BJP has vowed to reverse special programs setting aside jobs and slots in colleges for Muslims, as they do for the lower castes of Hindu society. It also wants to eliminate the right of Muslim religious law, dictating personal issues like divorce and marriage, to supersede Indian common law.<ep>
   BJP politicians also are committed to building India's nuclear weapons program (--) targeted at the Muslim archenemy, Pakistan. And they question the wisdom of opening India's vast economy to multinational corporations.<ep>
   ``Be Indian, buy Indian,'' said a top BJP leader.<ep>
   If the BJP advances its agenda, Muslims like Ismat Malihabadi, who teaches the Urdu language at Lucknow University, predicted violence once again.<ep>
   ``If the BJP comes to power, the whole country will be thrown into turmoil,'' Malihabadi said. He warned, ``We will turn the whole country into Kashmir'' (--) the embattled northern state where Muslim militants are fighting to separate from India.<ep>
   On a national level, BJP politicians have been trying to tone down the extremist rhetoric of the past. Recognizing their rise as a major power, they want to convince the public that the BJP is a party for all Indians, concerned about such national issues as corruption, inflation and poverty. They note that moderate BJP politicians have run several state and local governments without dramatically divisive results.<ep>
   Their possible candidate for prime minister is A.B. Vajpayee, a poet and former foreign minister, who projects a relatively palatable, liberal image and <m4>11.761 inches ( 70p10 )  end of leg 1  <m2>** COLUMN 2 **<qc>

<m0>rarely mentions the Ram temple.<ep>
   But here in the Hindu heartland of north-central India, where passions over the temple still run deep, there is no attempt by local BJP leaders to temper their Hindu chauvinism.<ep>
   Vinay Katiyar is the BJP candidate for the district centered around Faizabad, a congested, dirty city of nearly 200,000 which is unremarkable except for its closeness to the holy city of Ayodhya. Katiyar was elected to parliament in 1991 and is likely to win again.<ep>
   Speaking on the election eve inside the BJP's Faizabad headquarters in a large, unfurnished office space, Katiyar sat on a straw mat, encircled by more than 50 of his most ardent supporters.<ep>
   Katiyar, a bombastic speaker in his 40s, talked about the threat to the ``Indian identity.'' There are about 1.2 million voters in Katiyar's constituency, of whom less than 200,000 are Muslim.<ep>
   ``A Muslim who is a nationalist and considers himself Indian will vote for me,'' Katiyar said. ``But a Muslim who owes his allegiance to [Pakistan], that Muslim will not vote for me, but I don't want his vote. His status, as far as I'm concerned, is that of a refugee.''<ep>
   Violence and communal strife have defined the relationship between Muslims and Hindus since Britain partitioned its former colony into two separate nations (--) mostly Hindu India, and mostly Muslim Pakistan. (Pakistan was a divided country; East Pakistan eventually broke away from West Pakistan to become independent Bangladesh.)<ep>
   Today, India is 80 percent Hindu.<ep>
   Once the BJP, which has ties to known Hindu extremist groups, was shunned by moderate Indians. As recently as a dozen years ago, it held only two seats in the lower house of parliament.<ep>
   But it has been winning supporters among upper caste Indians, particularly merchants and members of the middle class. They resent the government's setting aside 50 percent of civil service jobs for lower caste citizens and Muslims. In many ways, the debate echoes the backlash to affirmative action programs in the United States.<ep>
   ``Merit should always decide who gets a job,'' said Neerja Mishra, a 32-year-old supporter of Katiyar, who is college educated and an upper caste Brahmin.<ep>
   Katiyar rode into office in 1991 on a wave of Hindu nationalism that his party fomented, using the question of Ayodhya as its main campaign issue. Hindus insist that long before Moghul invaders from Central Asia built the mosque there, it was the site of an ancient Hindu temple that marked the birthplace of Ram.<ep>
   The former leader of the BJP, L.K. Advani, traveled around the country, vowing, ``We swear by Lord Ram that we will build a temple there!''<ep>
   In Faizabad, Katiyar still uses the same rallying cry (--) dismissing fears that a new temple would ignite renewed violence.<ep>
   ``Rebuilding the temple is a pledge that cannot be broken,'' Katiyar said. ``The temple is not a mere question of a place to pray. It's a symbol, closely aligned with our religion and nationalistic sentiments.''<ep>
   Surrounded by his followers, he shouted: ``Whoever lobbies for the mosque to be rebuilt is a demon and we have to crush their heads!'' All around, <m4>23.800 inches ( 143p4 )  end of leg 2  <m2>** COLUMN 3 **<qc>
<ql>
<m0>the BJP members nodded in agreement.<ep>
   Many, in fact, refuse to even concede that the Muslims ever had a place of worship in Ayodhya.<ep>
   ``It was not a mosque. It is a disputed site,'' said Vishnu Gupta, a gold trader and BJP supporter.<ep>
   Gupta remembers the day in 1992 when 600,000 Hindus stormed the mosque. He called them ``activists,'' not militants, and volunteered to feed them.<ep>
   ``This site is too important for us to make a compromise,'' Gupta insisted. ``Lord Ram was born there and there's no question about not having a temple on the site. Let whatever happens, happens.''<ep>
   After quietly listening as Katiyar ranted about the temple, Omprakash Yadav, a driver who is a member of a lower caste and did not intend to vote for the BJP, walked away, shaking his head.<ep>
   ``I am a religious man and I pray to Lord Ram,'' Yadav said, ``but I don't want a temple built in such a manner that thousands might die again.''<ep>
