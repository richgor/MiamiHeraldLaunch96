<m0>   RJECICA DONJA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (--) (AP) (--) Bosnian Serbs Thursday attacked a U.N. police vehicle and journalists who were accompanying Muslims visiting their old homes and relatives' graves.<ep>
   Two shots were fired by one Serb man, but no one was hit in this central Bosnian town.<ep>
   The four Serb attackers repeatedly broke through Bosnian Serb police lines, smashing a Bosnian television camera and an AP news camera. One man jumped on a U.N. pickup truck and shattered the windshield with his boot.<ep>
   ``We're not letting them through,'' shouted one Serb. ``Our blood was spilled here.''<ep>
   Associated Press photographer Vadim Ghirda was beaten, suffering cuts on his face and bruises on his hands and legs.<ep>
   The latest Serb-Muslim face-off highlighted the problems with freedom of movement, a frequently ignored linchpin of Bosnia's peace agreement. It came as NATO's commander in Bosnia discussed such violations with U.N. officials.<ep>
   Two Serbian police later intervened to break up Thursday's attack. But the Serbs were allowed to remain and continued threatening the group, which ventured into territory now held by the Serbs to visit homes the Muslims were forced to flee during the war.<ep>
   In the northwest, meanwhile, a Bosnian government team prepared Thursday to excavate a suspected mass grave, dug by the Serbs.<ep>
   The excavations, near Sanski Most about 100 miles northwest of Sarajevo, were begun following the discovery of several bodies during the reconstruction of a bridge destroyed during the war.<ql>
