   MOSCOW (--) President Boris N. Yeltsin chided his top security aide for urging postponement of Russia's June 16 presidential election and promised Monday the vote will be held on schedule.<ep>
   ``I trust in the wisdom of Russian voters,'' Yeltsin told the Interfax news agency. ``That is why elections will be held in the time determined by the constitution.''<ep>
   Politicians across the spectrum welcomed Yeltsin's pledge and scorned the advice of his security chief, Lt. Gen. Alexander V. Korzhakov, who predicted in two interviews Sunday that the election will push Russia toward violent conflict. But they warned that the threat to a fair election is not over.<ep>
   Russia has held one democratic election in its history, when voters in 1991 elected Yeltsin, a Communist maverick-turned-reformer, in the dying months of the Soviet Union. Now the unpopular incumbent is fighting an uphill battle for re-election against the resurgent Communist Party.<ep>
   Noting that the electorate is deeply polarized, Yeltsin said Monday that ``several people'' agree with Korzhakov's view that a victory by Communist leader Gennady A. Zyuganov ``would be the beginning of a civil war.''<ep>
   But he said he ordered his powerful aide ``not to meddle in politics and not to make such statements anymore.''<ep>
   Despite the retort, many Kremlin watchers believe that Yeltsin must have cleared the remarks by one of his closest confidants, perhaps to test public reaction. Some speculated he wants to sow fear of unrest in the hope of persuading one or more of his rivals to drop out of the race and support him.<ep>
   ``I don't think it is profitable for Yeltsin to postpone the election, but his staff is preparing various scenarios,'' said Nikolai Petrov, a Russian political scientist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ``For example, some of them are saying it would be easier to falsify the results than to call off the vote.''<ep>
   Other analysts said the presidential staff is split between those who believe Yeltsin can win a fair election and pessimists who agree with Korzhakov that Yeltsin needs to cut a deal with the Communists or put off the vote in order to stay in power.<ep>
