<m0>   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (--) (AP) (--) The party that gave South Africa apartheid decided Thursday to withdraw from President Nelson Mandela's unity government and try to influence policy as a ``vigilant'' opposition force.<ep>
   In an announcement that reflected the deepening maturity of South Africa's democracy, the white-led National Party said it would leave the government on June 30. The announcement came one day after the Constitutional Assembly accepted a new constitution.<ep>
   ``The National Party has felt for some time now that our influence within the government of national unity has been declining,'' said party leader F.W. de Klerk. He had expressed concern Wednesday that the new constitution gave too much power to the governing party.<ep>
   The withdrawal also appeared to be motivated in part by the National Party's desire to position itself as an independent force before the 1999 parliamentary elections.<ep>
   ``We will be able to exercise greater influence on the economic policies of the government by publicly adopting a vigilant and critical role than by exercising our diminishing influence within the government,'' de Klerk said.<ep>

Mandela<ue5><ql>
<m0>   Mandela said at a news conference that unity and reconciliation in South Africa did not depend on an enforced coalition and his African National Congress party had the confidence to govern alone.<ep>

<m0>The rand currency took a hit, but the stability of Mandela's ANC government was never in question. The ANC enjoys a comfortable majority in Parliament and a wide base of support.<ep>
   Still, the participation of the National Party and other minority parties in the government had been a stabilizing factor in the transition from apartheid to democracy. That participation had been mandated by South Africa's interim constitution, replaced Wednesday after two years of debate.<ep>
   The new constitution, unlike the interim one, does not require the president to give Cabinet posts to parties that receive at least 10 percent of the vote.<ep>
   Mandela thanked de Klerk and his party colleagues for their ``constructive role'' in his government, but added they had a continuing responsibility toward ``eradicating the legacy of apartheid, which they created.''<ep>
   ``As such, we hope that their decision to play a more active role as an opposition party does not mean obstructing the process of the transformation or defending apartheid privilege,'' said Mandela.<ep>

De Klerk<ue5><ql>
<m0>   De Klerk was the South African president who released Mandela after 27 years in prison and began the negotiations that led to majority rule. The National Party led the country for four decades under <m4>De  Klerk<m2><ql>
<m0>apartheid.<ep>
   To reassure investors, de Klerk said Thursday's decision did not portend any growing political instability and added that the government's basic economic policies were sound.<ep>
   ``Our decision should be seen as an important step in the growing maturity and normalization of our young democracy,'' he said. ``We believe that the development of a strong and vigilant opposition is essential for the maintenance and promotion of a genuine multiparty democracy.''<ep>
   De Klerk said he and other party ministers would resign June 30. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Although the ANC controls more than 60 percent of the 490 seats in Parliament, the National Party had been vital in policy-making because the ANC lacked the two-thirds majority necessary to approve the constitution.<ep>
   The Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party, the third largest political party, said it was not worried about the change.<ep>
   ``We always have been skeptical about the value of the government of national unity, but I don't think the presence or not of the National Party will affect our position one way or another,'' said spokesman Walter Felgate.<ep>
