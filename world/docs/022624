   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (--) Deputy President F.W. de Klerk announced Thursday that he and his white-led National Party are quitting South Africa's unity government to become a true opposition in Parliament.<ep>
   The departure of de Klerk and six ministers, set for June 30, marks a dramatic shakeout in President Nelson Mandela's multiracial national unity Cabinet two years after he was elected in South Africa's first all-races election. It came a day after passage of a permanent post-apartheid constitution guaranteeing a system of civil rights and parliamentary democracy.<ep>
   Both de Klerk and Mandela described the National Party's departure as a move that will help normalize multi-party politics in the new system. But it ruptured Mandela's carefully crafted coalition, intended to bring together blacks and whites polarized by years of officially enforced racial separation, and it opened the possibility that South Africa, for the first time, could have an executive fully controlled by black-majority parties.<ep>

<m0>      The nervous South African currency, the rand, has dropped dramatically over the past two days on news of de Klerk's departure. But analysts said they expect it to stabilize. Mandela said his govern<m4>Mandela<m2><ql>
<m0>ment's fiscal and political policies will not change and that de Klerk's departure ``recognizes that our young democracy has come of age.''<ep>
   De Klerk wished Mandela's executive well, said his government is functioning effectively and tried to reassure the country and its allies of his party's continued participation in politics. His party will retain its 99 seats in the 490-member Parliament.<ep>
   ``We are not taking this decision in a negative spirit,'' he said. ``. . . We believe that the development of a strong and vigilant opposition is essential for the maintenance and promotion of genuine multiparty democracy.''<ep>

De Klerk<ue5><ql>
<m0>   De Klerk is one of two deputy presidents in a unity government cobbled together after the April 1994 elections. That government has brought the country from white-minority rule to democracy.<ep>
    <m4>De  Klerk<m2><ql>
<m0>But de Klerk, the last president under apartheid, called it ``unnatural'' to remain in a unity Cabinet slated to become obsolete. Under the new constitution passed Wednesday by Parliament, the unity Cabinet system will end after the 1999 elections. A party winning a parliamentary majority in that race will be able to appoint its own Cabinet or voluntarily enter another unity coalition. Although the National Party agreed to this strict majority-rule system in voting for the new constitution, it did so under protest.<ep>
   De Klerk has had difficult personal and political relations with Mandela for years. The two men, one representing a discredited, racist system of government, the other representing the aspirations of the nation's black majority, were chained together by their converging desires for an end to race conflict and by the moment in history over which they presided.<ep>
   But the new political lineup here left de Klerk's Nationalists with a dilemma: how to participate in a unity government while trying to be an opposition party with credible appeal to its largely white constituents.<ep>
   De Klerk has repeatedly warned, even as recently as Wednesday, that the National Party would one day quit the government.<ep>
   But the timing of the move and Thursday's surprise announcement appeared to catch Mandela off guard.<ep>
   Before de Klerk had phoned him, Mandela said the loss of his major partner in the unity government would be ``regrettable.''<ep>
   After de Klerk informed him of the decision, Mandela called a news conference at which he thanked de Klerk for his ``important role in ensuring this smooth transition,'' but also cautioned the Nationalists against returning to their apartheid roots.<ep>
