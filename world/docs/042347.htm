   WADI AL ABAYADH, Oman -- The Toyota Land Cruiser bucked as it sped in and out of the snaky river.<P>

   Its engine screamed and sputtered. Waves of water slapped the windshield. Splat, splat, splat.<P>

   ``Whoa!'' said Fauzya Al-Jabry, 21, ducking in the passenger seat next to her husband, Sayed. ``I feel like I'm taking a shower!''<P>

   Not a shower. Try wadi bashing.<P>

   Huh?<P>

   It's only the hottest outdoor sport in this sheikdom -- a national obsession that reveals much about modern Oman, a Kansas-size nation of nearly two million people at the eastern elbow of the Arabian peninsula. Wadi bashing is kind of like off-road vehicles tearing through Everglades muck, only there's no muck. It's similar to snowmobiles careening off North Country moguls, only there's no snow.<P>

   It involves packing some food and maybe camping equipment, driving off in a four-wheel-drive vehicle with slightly deflated tires for better traction in gravel and finding a beautiful and shallow run in a wadi, or riverbed. Then it's bouncing off submerged rocks, smashing through water -- bashing a wadi. And hoping not to get stuck.<P>

   If this sounds like an adventure for Omani macho men, well, there's something to that. But many here say this is also an outing for the whole family, sometimes including picnics and camp-outs.<P>

   ``We don't have any place to go for fun,'' said Dalia Mohammed, 24, a mother of one. ``There is only this place. After you stop driving, it's very quiet. It's natural: water, greenery, trees, nothing human-made. It's the best.''<P>

   She and her husband joined three families, about 15 people in all, who were sitting on blankets and cooking omelets with tomatoes over a charcoal fire. Nearby, a dozen children splashed each other in the river. Mohammed Saleh, 27, a banker, flipped an omelet in a skillet. ``Old Omanis go to camel races,'' he said. ``Young people do this.''<P>

   Then again, old Omanis lived in another century. The 18th Century. Before 1970, Oman was one of the most isolated places on earth. Sultan Said Bin Taimur, in his 32 years of rule, virtually sealed off Oman in a medieval time capsule. He controlled visas, which meant few people ever left and even fewer returned. He opposed all means of Western progress -- banning radios and even eyeglasses -- in hopes of saving tradition above all else.<P>

   Fast-forward to 20th Century<P>

   His only son, Qaboos Bin Said, overthrew him in a bloodless palace coup. The son, aided by buckets of money from the new discovery of oil, ushered in Western progress at a fast-forward pace. Suddenly Oman -- which had only six miles of paved roads, three primary schools and three hospitals in 1970 -- leaped into the modern world.<P>

   With oil money, Sultan Qaboos established a generous welfare system, built modern highways, opened the country's first universities and created a world-class, free health-care system.<P>

   Along the way, the Omani ways were forever altered. Fathers who rode camels raised sons who drove Mercedes-Benzes. Penniless desert dwellers now owned four-wheel-drive cars -- and raised their offspring on new values and new sport. Out: camel racing. In: wadi bashing.<P>

   That's not to say camel racing is dead. Oman boasts some of the fastest camels on earth. It has camel racetracks; sheiks from nearby Dubai and Abu Dhabi gleefully travel here for betting and for buying. Fast camels fetch $130,000 or more. Ordinary camel races deep into the desert often feature a purse of a $20,000 car.<P>

   Camel, horse racing pale<P>

   ``But camel racing is boring,'' said Mohammed Saleh, the young banker on a wadi-bashing expedition. ``You race, a camel wins and that's it.''<P>

   Oman's other major pastime is Arabian horse racing. But Sultan Qaboos is the only person in the country allowed to have Arabian steeds. <P>

   ``It's his horses racing against his horses. Guess who wins? What's the fun in that?'' said one Omani, who respectfully asked not to be identified.<P>

   Saleh had taken his mother, Saqina Mohammed, about 75, on the recent wadi outing. It was her first wadi bash.<P>

   ``I came because I wanted to have fun with the family,'' she said.<P>

   Was she scared? ``No, no,'' she said. <P>

   ``Ah, she's scared,'' Saleh said. ``She was worried we would get stuck or something.''<P>

   Time for a tow<P>

   They didn't. But Sayed and Fauzya Al-Jabry did. Their Land Cruiser, hubcap deep in the river, spit riverbed pebbles from spinning back tires. It was embarrassing: The Saleh camp was only 20 feet away. But it was good luck, too: The other bashers had winches and rope.<P>

   Wearing an Oakland Raiders football cap and a Kool T-shirt, Hussein Mohammed, 29, expertly backed his Range Rover down a steep, gravel embankment to the river's edge. Three other bashers waded through the thigh-deep river and tied the rope to the Land Cruiser. The Range Rover spun and kicked dirt, the Land Cruiser inched forward and zigzagged onto firmer ground.<P>

   Then the rope snapped. But Sayed Al-Jabry managed to maneuver his vehicle out of the river, regaining respect from the other bashers. <P>

   And he was off -- bouncing, bashing, windshield wipers on fast speed, grinning widely, his wife lying low.
