<m0>   KRASNOYARSK, Russia (--) (AP) (--) A scientist has been arrested for allegedly smuggling out of Russia more than two pounds of materials that could be used for nuclear weapons production, officials said Tuesday.<ep>
   The ITAR-Tass news agency, which first reported the arrest, said the materials were radioactive and could potentially be used to make nuclear weapons. But an intelligence official denied that.<ep>
   ``It was not uranium, plutonium or something like that,'' said Anatoly Samkov, the head of the Krasnoyarsk regional department of Russia's Federal Security Service.<ep>
   Samkov told the Interfax news agency that the materials could be used to produce components of nuclear weapons, such as coating or tubes.<ep>
   He did not elaborate but said the materials were banned for export under Russian regulations on dual-purpose materials with potential military uses. Samkov added that it was not even clear if the suspect, a former scientist, would be indicted.<ep>
   The ITAR-Tass report cited a Federal Security Service spokesman as saying the suspect, who worked in a research center in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, supposedly invented a new method of making nuclear materials. He later smuggled the materials out of Russia, the spokesman was quoted as saying.<ep>
   The ITAR-Tass report indicated that the smuggled materials could potentially be enriched for use in nuclear weapons. Estimates vary, but some researchers suggest that small nuclear bombs could be made with as little as two pounds of highly enriched uranium.<ep>
   The Federal Security Service spokesman would not give the scientist's name, place of work or the destination of the smuggled materials.<ql>
