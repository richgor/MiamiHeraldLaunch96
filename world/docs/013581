<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   A Hamas leader accused of funding and ordering terrorist attacks in Israel can be extradited to that country, a New York judge ruled Wednesday.<ep>
   U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy said Israel had established probable cause that Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook knew of Hamas' plan to carry out the attacks, chose the leaders and supplied the money.<ep>
   Abu Marzook's lawyer, Stanley Cohen, said he would appeal the decision, delaying extradition.<ep>

cease-fire monitoring<ql>

<m0>   The Clinton administration will bring together diplomats from Syria, Lebanon, Israel and France today to arrange monitoring of the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas.<ep>
   Dennis Ross, senior U.S. troubleshooter for the Middle East, will preside at the meeting in Washington of the countries' ambassadors. <ep>
   The cease-fire was designed not only to halt the fighting but also help reopen the negotiations Israel has held sporadically with Syria and Lebanon since 1991.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>MANAMA<m0> (--) An explosion destroyed a house in a Shiite Muslim village, killing a couple and their 3-year-old son. Investigators blamed the blast on a bomb being built at the house.<ep>
   Four people, including the couple's 5-year-old son, were wounded in the blast Tuesday in the village of Sanabis, which like most Shiite villages in Bahrain has been a center of dissent against the government.<ep>

<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   <m0>LONDON<m0> (--) Mad cow disease is ``very much on the wane,'' although Britain can still expect between 15,000 and 24,000 new cases by the end of 1999, a new study predicts.<ep>
   Three-quarters of those cases will occur in animals born since a 1988 ban on feeding cattle with sheep offal, researchers at Oxford University found.<ep>
   That's because farmers continued to feed cattle contaminated offal after the ban and because the disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, tends to appear when an animal is 4 or 5 years old, said researcher Dov Stekel.<ep>
