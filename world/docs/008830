   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (--) Thousands of tired and hungry Liberian refugees have been forced back to open waters aboard a leaky freighter despite concerns the ship is not seaworthy.<ep>
   Ivory Coast officials, fearing a new flood of refugees from fighting in Liberia, forced the ship back into the Atlantic late Thursday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.<ep>
   ``We are very worried about the 4,000 Liberians on the boat,'' agency spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said Friday. ``The conditions on the boat are appalling. The boat is damaged.''<ep>
   Berthiaume said Ivorian authorities also forced most of the women and children who had been taken from the ship for medical care and food to get back on.<ep>
   ``The boat was not seaworthy,'' said Una McCauley of Save the Children in Abidjan. ``Thousands of people were sleeping on top of each other. . . . Women and children were excreting right where they were.''<ep>
   Ivorian officials have repeatedly declined to comment.<ep>
   Panicked Liberians fleeing a month of brutal fighting in their capital, Monrovia, packed the Ghana-bound freighter Bulk Challenge on Sunday.<ep>
   Port officials said no more than 1,000 people should have been on board, although the boat owner, who was on the vessel, has not been reached to confirm that assessment. The ship, traveling on rough seas in hot weather, has no toilets or sleeping accommodations.<ep>
   ``The people were packed like a Times Square bus at peak hour,'' said Peter Seebok, the Dutch owner of another ship that took Liberian refugees to the western Ivory Coast port of San Pedro.<ep>
   The Bulk Challenge limped into San Pedro on Monday, having taken on six feet of water. Some repairs were made Thursday, but it was unclear whether the boat was seaworthy when it set sail later that day.<ep>
   Relief agencies supplied the ship with rice, bread, sardines, plastic sheeting, buckets and soap before it left.<ep>
   Steen Henson of the U.N. refugee agency in Abidjan said the country was already flooded with 350,000 Liberian refugees who have fled across the border since rebel leader Charles Taylor launched the war from Ivory Coast six years ago.<ep>
   Ivorian authorities told the United Nations they were afraid some of the refugees had participated in the fighting that has destroyed the Liberian capital in the past month.<ep>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said U.S. officials have urged Ivory Coast's leaders to respect international laws governing refugees.<ep>
   The refugees ``should be treated with care and humanitarian principles in mind. If they can be assisted with food or water or shelter, that should happen,'' he said.<ep>
   Meanwhile, in Liberia, tens of thousands of people continued to flee the capital to the countryside, despite relative calm on Friday. At least 20,000 people have jammed into the central Liberian town of Gbarnga, Taylor's headquarters.<ep>
