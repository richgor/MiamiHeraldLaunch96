<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) The current dispute between President Clinton and congressional critics over whether China should have the same trade benefits as most other American trading partners is a small fight with potentially enormous consequences.<ep>
   While China is the fifth-largest trading partner with the United States, trade between the two nations is a relatively small part of overall American trade.<ep>
   But the long-term prospect of business with the world's most populous nation makes the question of how we manage that trade very important.<ep>
   ``Projections are that by 2010, they will be the world's largest economy, exceeding our own,'' a White House official said. ``It would be foolish to ignore that.''<ep>
   In 1995, U.S.-China trade totaled $57.2 billion (--) nearly 80 percent of it imports from China.<ep>
   That trade represented just 4 percent of the $1.3 trillion in total U.S. trade with other nations, but in the trade world, ``that's a big number,'' said Peter Morici, director of the University of Maryland's Center for International Business Education and Research.<ep>
   Even more important, he said, the U.S. market represents about a third of China's total exports.<ep>
   The money China is making selling goods to the United States is helping to pay for its modernization, Morici said.<ep>
   If its exports to the United States are cut, he said, ``Where would they get the money to buy the planes, the construction machinery, the electric generators and trucks they do buy from us?''<ep>
   The current dispute centers on low U.S. tariffs granted to China thanks to its status as a Most Favored Nation trading partner. Virtually every country with which America trades has that status.<ep>
   Clinton is poised to review China's status, and some in Congress think it should be denied to send the world's largest communist regime a message on human rights abuses, copyright piracy, nuclear weapons proliferation and threats against Taiwan and Hong Kong.<ep>
   Republican presidential candidate and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole on Thursday threw his weight behind most-favored-nation renewal for China, resisting entreaties from a spectrum of opponents, including some conservatives in his own party.<ep>
