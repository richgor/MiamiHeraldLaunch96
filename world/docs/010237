   HONG KONG (--) About 200 Vietnamese boat people, facing a forced return home, fled a detention center in Hong Kong Friday after battering down the gates.<ep>
   In the chaos of the uprising, other people among the 8,000 refugees in the Whitehead detention camp set fire to barracks and the administration center, and briefly held 15 camp officers hostage. The escapees fled into the surrounding hills and towns in predawn darkness.<ep>
   More than 18,000 Vietnamese refugees, some of whom have been here for more than eight years, are being held in what amount to prison camps in Hong Kong, waiting to be returned to Vietnam. They are among 35,000 boat people who remain in Southeast Asia among the 800,000 who have fled to these countries from Vietnam, usually in small boats, since the fall of Saigon to the Communists in 1975.<ep>
   Virtually all of the camp residents have been interviewed by the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and have been declared ineligible for asylum because they would not be expected to face political persecution upon returning home.<ep>
   The government of Hong Kong, a British crown colony, has said it hopes to send the Vietnamese home before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. China has insisted that the Vietnamese be returned.<ep>
   Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, the highest-ranking civil servant in the territory, described the violence as ``deplorable,'' but said it would not change the government's plan to send the boat people back to Vietnam.<ep>
   As the day wore on, squads of police fanned out across the New Territories, Hong Kong's piece of the Chinese mainland, erecting roadblocks, searching housing developments and combing the hills around the camp looking for the escaped refugees.<ep>
   Local television showed plainclothes police chasing and capturing young Vietnamese men as they ran through the grounds of an apartment complex in Shatin.<ep>
   Although police estimated that 200 Vietnamese may have managed to escape, the torching of the camp's administration building made it difficult to determine the precise number of escapees. Sixteen other buildings were destroyed by fire and more than 40 cars were burned.<ep>
   Meanwhile, in clouds of tear gas, the police and guards battled Vietnamese at the camp. Wielding clubs and makeshift spears, the Vietnamese fought squads of officers in helmets and protective vests, carrying plastic shields. <ep>
   About 22 police, firefighters and camp officers were injured, although none seriously, the police said.<ep>
   By late afternoon, police said, 61 Vietnamese had been recaptured.<ep>
