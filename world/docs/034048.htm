   RJECICA DONJA, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Forty Muslims, escorted by U.N. police and journalists, set off Thursday morning to visit abandoned homes and family graves in a Serb-held village.<P>

   By noon, their plans lay shattered, ruined by one of the same Serbs who helped drive them out when war erupted four years ago.<P>

   Serbs attacked a U.N. police vehicle, beat up an AP photographer and smashed cameras and equipment Thursday as they trashed the Bosnian peace accord's freedom of movement provisions.<P>

   At 7:30 a.m., the Muslims trudged out of government-held Maglaj toward the Zone of Separation, the former front line.<P>

   As they reached Serb-held land, a Bosnian Serb police car took up the escort. A Serbian policeman stood every 100 yards.<P>

   Serbian bunkers, apparently abandoned, gouged the slopes above the road. Damaged houses loomed into view.<P>

   ``I've got goose bumps,'' admitted a Muslim called Sahbaz, pointing to the ruin of a home he hasn't seen since 1992.<P>

   Sticking to agreed rules, the group did not approach the houses. But in the village, men were gathered behind Serbian police.<P>

   One broke through the police line, hurling a Bosnian television news camera to the ground. The shaken cameraman picked it up and retreated.<P>

   Shouting ``No cameras! No pictures!'' the Serbs turned on AP photographer Vadim Ghirda, beating him, destroying his camera and exposing the film. A dog bit a policeman who tried to help him.<P>

   Two pistol shots were fired into the ground. The gunman jumped on a U.N. police pickup truck and smashed the windshield with his boot.<P>

   A Serb in a black windbreaker angrily claimed it was agreed that no cameras would be allowed. He threatened violence unless the films were handed over. He broke the Bosnian television cassette in his hands -- then a roll of film, an audio cassette and another video cassette.<P>

   The Muslims' leader, Hilmo Sahman, said his group wanted to turn back.<P>

   ``I really wanted to see what used to belong to me. I have my parents buried there. I just wanted to see the place again,'' Sahman said.<P>

   Two other Muslims, Mustafa Hasanic and Sadik Sahman, said the man who rushed the cameraman was Perica Stojanovic, a Serbian military commander when the war started.<P>

   The only comfort was the Serbian police.<P>

   ``We thank them. They did their best,'' Sadik Sahman said. ``Next time, we hope it will be better.''
