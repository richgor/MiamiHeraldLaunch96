   JERUSALEM (--) This is a place waiting for a bomb.<ep>
   With only three weeks before the Israeli elections, police and intelligence chiefs have put the country on high alert for a terror attack from a Muslim militant suicide bomber.<ep>
   ``I do not want to frighten the public,'' national police commander Assaf Hefetz said last week. ``But I certainly must take into account that a gathering of people in a defined place could be a problem.''<ep>
   In recent weeks, three planned attacks failed (--) two after bombs detonated on the bodies of the bombers, while a third harmed no one.<ep>
   ``We had a lot of luck,'' said Maj. Gen. Aryeh Amit, head of the Jerusalem police.<ep>
   Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants have vowed to carry out suicide attacks against Israel in retaliation for the 16-day Israeli cross-border war with Hezbollah guerrillas, which killed at least 152 people in Lebanon. The aim of the attacks is to derail the peace process.<ep>
   The possibility of another suicide bomber is deemed so great that both the Labor and Likud parties have already plotted their reactions. Labor, <m2><ql>

PLEASE SEE  ISRAEL,  8A<qr>
  <ql>
<ql>
ISRAEL,  FROM  1A<ql>
<m0>Peres' party, has a campaign slogan in the wings: ``Terror Will Not Affect Us.''<ep>
   But is it true? What would happen after a bomb?<ql>
<m1>Political fallout<ep>
<m0>   At stake is the course of the next four years in Israel, and the course of peace in the Middle East. The race between Peres and Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu has been extremely close since four bus bombings two months ago killed 63 people.<ep>
   Peres favors pushing ahead with peace plans on all Arab fronts. Netanyahu favors a ``secure peace,'' which means he would honor previous agreements but greatly slow down, if not halt, current peace negotiations.<ep>
   Polls released late last week contradicted each other, giving Peres leads that varied from 3 percent to nearly 12 percent. Analysts agree, though, that any terror attack will hurt Peres. Even Peres agrees, describing his fluctuating poll standings last week as terror's curse: ``My situation was good until buses started to explode.''<ep>
   By some accounts here, the threats alone of a new attack have had an impact. The headline of Maariv's Friday supplement read: <m0>Nerve-Racking Wait (--) the question is not whether there will be a bombing attack, but when and where.<m0><ep>
   But many other voices believe that as a whole, Israelis are taking the threats in stride, quietly tucking them away in the attics of their subconscious, just as they always have.<ep>
   ``We are a tough people,'' said Avi Degani, head of the Geocartographic Institute, which conducts research and polls. ``We learn very quickly to take what has to come. It numbs your feelings, the edges of your nerves are a little less exposed.''<ep>
   Still, Degani acknowledged, ``people are probably refraining from going to places that aren't really necessary. Maybe especially in Jerusalem because they have suffered so much more than the rest of the country. In Tel Aviv, our cinemas are full, the marketplaces are swarming like always, the beaches are crowded.''<ql>
<m1>The fear factor<ep>
<m0>   But in a Geocartographic poll released March 5 (--) the day after the last of the four bus bombings (--) the depth of people's fears was very apparent.<ep>
   Asked whether they believed ``terrorism is likely to strike at you,'' 40 percent said yes to ``a certain extent'' and 33 percent ``had a very unpleasant feeling.'' Thirty-eight percent said they feared going to Jerusalem.<ep>
   And 47 percent of Jerusalem residents said they were more cautious or very afraid about going to crowded places. Fifteen percent said they wouldn't go near crowds.<ep>
   The poll's results are borne out at the 240-store Jerusalem Mall, the largest mall in the Middle East, which normally attracts about 20,000 people a day.<ep>
   The number of <m1> <m0>shoppers fell to almost nothing after the March attacks; the mall still hasn't fully recovered.<ep>
   ``We are doing everything we can to protect our people, our customers,'' said Rina Patsat, a mall spokeswoman.<ep>
   That means more security guards, soldiers and police officers. They check cars. They check bags. And they have one question for every shopper: ``Weapon?'' (Weapon-carriers with licenses may proceed.)<ql>
<m1>Reluctant shoppers<ep>
<m0>   On a midday afternoon last week, conversations with shoppers made two things clear: Many hadn't decided between Peres and Netanyahu, and everyone said that security, or peace with security, was the main issue.<ep>
   ``I work in an aluminum factory. I'm a manager for 40 people. I live in Pisgat Zeev. I have five children. Everything is good (--) except for our security,'' said Motty Peretz, 41, an undecided voter surrounded by four of his children.<ep>
   He continued: ``All my life, I have wanted security. I want my children to be able to go out and not fear that someone may try to kill them. We have terror here. I don't feel secure in this place, the mall. There are a lot of doors. Not all the doors have officers. We are only here because my son needs to take a test here.''<ep>
   Michael Biton, 34, a Netanyahu supporter who manages a bathroom supply store, said the situation at the mall was a good example of the problems of peace.<ep>
   ``I feel relatively safe here, but there's a lot of anxiety in the air,'' Biton said. ``An attack can happen anywhere here, especially in a mall like this.''<ep>
   But a dancer from Argentina, Carina Grossmann, believed it would be more dangerous to stop the peace process than to continue with it.<ep>
   ``I have concerns about my security if Likud wins the election,'' said Grossmann, 35, who moved to Israel six years ago. ``If Netanyahu is elected and he doesn't return all the territories, that will lead us to another <m0>intifada, <m0>another war.''<ep>
   She and a friend, Robin Press, 29, a sculptor originally from New York City, were trying to decide on a movie. They talked about how violence may in the end determine peace.<ep>
   ``The Lebanon fighting was horrible to see, but it helps Peres,'' Grossmann said.<ep>
   ``But in this country, what may really matter is what happens the day of the elections,'' Press said.<ep>
   On election day, May 29, police plan to deploy 20,000 officers around the country to prevent an attack (--) and to protect voters.<ql>
