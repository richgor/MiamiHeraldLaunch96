<m0>   <m0>TUZLA <m0>(--) Seven armed men who surrendered to U.S. forces were turned over to Bosnian Serb officials who say they are Muslim soldiers and accuse them of murdering civilians.<ep>
   Bosnian Serb officials promised Saturday they would allow international police and the Red Cross access to the men and that the men could see their lawyers, U.S. officers said.<ep>
   The men, armed with pistols and grenades, threw themselves on the ground and surrendered to U.S. soldiers in Bosnian Serb territory Friday afternoon, the officers said.<ep>
   Bosnian Serb news reports said the men were members of a Muslim terrorist group. The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported the seven admitted killing four civilians in the Srebrenica area on May 2 and burying them in Krusev Do, 10 miles southwest of the city. <ql>
<m0>(box) MOSTAR <m0>(--) The main Muslim party made good on a threat to boycott local elections in the divided city of Mostar by failing to meet a Saturday deadline to register. The move could jeopardize what is widely seen as the last attempt to unify the southwestern town that has been sharply divided between Muslims and Croats since the two groups fought a war within Bosnia's war in 1993-94.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>KAMPALA<m0> (--) Tens of thousands of President Yoweri Museveni's supporters drove through the capital Saturday, honking car horns and chanting ``No change'' to celebrate his election victory.<ep>
   Museveni, already Uganda's longest-serving president, will be sworn in today in an open-air ceremony in a Kampala park.<ep>
   Rewarded by voters for restoring peace and prosperity after seizing power in a coup 10 years ago, Museveni easily won Uganda's first direct presidential election since independence from Britain in 1962.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>GROZNY <m0>(--) Clashes between Russian soldiers and Chechnya's separatist fighters appeared to intensify Saturday, and President Boris Yeltsin reaffirmed plans to visit the breakaway region soon.<ep>
   Dozens of people were reported dead or injured in fighting over the previous 24 hours.<ep>
   A Russian helicopter raid on the town of Urus-Martan killed one civilian and wounded eight people, including children, according to officials of the Moscow-backed Chechen government.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>HONG KONG <m0>(--) Police regained control Saturday of a detention camp for Vietnamese refugees after a mass breakout and two days of rioting, but 32 fugitives remained at large in the territory.<ep>
   A massive hunt in Hong Kong's hills and villages snared 87 of the 119 refugees who had escaped the barbed-wired camp Friday in a bid to avoid deportation to Vietnam. Earlier reports that 200 had escaped were exaggerated, prison officials said.<ep>
   While police plucked fleeing refugees off fishing boats and public buses, protesters left behind at the camp clashed with authorities, bombarding them with rocks and homemade spears.<ql>

The fighting reportedly began when nearly 200 Tamil guerrillas ambushed a military patrol on a road 125 miles east of Colombo, the capital.<ql>
