   KAMPALA, Uganda (--) For the first time since gaining independence 34 years ago, Ugandans voted for a president Thursday. The incumbent who shot his way to power a decade ago was expected to win.<ep>
   Voters waited in long lines to cast their ballots in an election that moves the East African nation a step toward fuller democracy and away from a murderous past.<ep>
   Voting at 15,000 polling stations across the country went smoothly and without violence, said Interim Electoral Commission spokesman David Byakutaaga. Security personnel were scarcely visible in Kampala, the capital, where streets were quiet on the election-day holiday.<ep>
   There was no immediate evidence of the vote-rigging that marred previous parliamentary elections.<ep>
   President Yoweri Museveni, who ended two decades of terror under Idi Amin and Milton Obote by shooting his way to power in 1986, was expected to easily fend off veteran politician Paul Ssemogerere and university Professor Muhammad Mayanja.<ep>
   The election marked the first time Ugandans voted directly for a president since gaining independence from Britain in 1962. In the three previous elections, two of which were boycotted by various regions, the votes went through an electoral college that was easy to manipulate.<ep>
   Ugandan historian Phares Mutibwa described the vote as a watershed.<ep>
   ``This is the first time we've had candidates standing up and saying to people, `I want to be elected,' '' Mutibwa said.<ep>
   Museveni's 10-year rule restored security and order, and rebuilt the landlocked nation of 18 million and its economy, which relies heavily on coffee production.<ep>
   Although admired by many Western donors for such successes, Museveni, 52, is also regarded as an autocrat.<ep>
   He has refused to adopt a traditional democracy. While political parties are legal, they may not publicly raise funds or hold meetings, and all candidates had to run as independents during the five-week campaign.<ep>
   Ssemogerere is a former ally of Obote, and Museveni used that link against his rival during the campaign.<ep>
   He suggested that Ssemogerere had a hand in the 1981 massacre of 300,000 Ugandans when Obote was in power. He also accused Ssemogerere of collaborating with rebels in the north and of plotting to help Obote return from exile in Zambia.<ep>
   Ssemogerere has denied the accusations.<ep>
   Nearly 8.5 million people in the nation of 18 million were eligible to vote.<ql>
