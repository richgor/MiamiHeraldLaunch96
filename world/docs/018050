<m0>   UNITED NATIONS (--) (AP) (--) Despite a report suggesting that Israel intentionally fired on a U.N. camp in Lebanon, Arab diplomats are finding little support on the U.N. Security Council for a strong condemnation.<ep>
   On Wednesday, the day after the U.N. report was released, Lebanese Ambassador Samir Moubarak said he would submit a resolution denouncing Israel for the April 18 shelling of the U.N. garrison at Qana, which killed at least 91 civilians.<ep>
   Israel has said the shelling was accidental, and that its fire was aimed at Hezbollah guerrilla positions near the camp. It said Thursday it would ask the Security Council to redefine the mandate of peacekeepers in Lebanon.<ep>
   The U.N. report said the pattern of artillery shell hits ``is inconsistent with a normal overshooting'' and that ``it is unlikely'' the barrage on the U.N. compound was an accident.<ep>
   ``The responsibility of Israel is very clear for all the public opinion of the world,'' Moubarak said.<ep>
   But after a full day of lobbying, an Arab diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said that only four of the 15 Security Council members (--) China, Guinea-Bissau, Egypt and Honduras (--) were prepared to support Lebanon's resolution.<ep>
   Any resolution condemning Israel would have faced an almost certain veto by the United States. <m2><ep>
