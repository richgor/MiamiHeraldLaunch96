   MOSCOW (--) President Boris Yeltsin, facing a tough Communist challenge in next month's election, told a crowd on the campaign trail Saturday that he and rival reformer Grigory Yavlinsky are ``uniting.''<ep>
   Yavlinsky denied it, and Yeltsin's comments seemed mainly to reflect fervent Kremlin hopes that Russia's splintered pro-reform forces might finally coalesce behind the president.<ep>
   With five weeks to go before the June 16 vote, polls show Yeltsin trailing or running neck-and-neck with Communist candidate Gennady Zyuganov.<ep>
   On a campaign swing in the Caspian Sea city of Astrakhan, Yeltsin told a meeting of supporters that he believes Yavlinsky and two other centrist candidates (--) Alexander Lebed and Svyatoslav Fyodorov (--) will back him.<ep>
   ``These hopes are based on my personal conversations'' with Yavlinsky and Lebed, and aides' talks with Fyodorov, Yeltsin said.<ep>
   ``I think this troika <m1> <m0>. . . will join the president's team,'' he said.<ep>
   But he added that cooperation could take ``various forms,'' and would not necessarily require them to pull out of the race. Yeltsin could be thinking of a possible second round, which would pit the top two vote-getters against each other if no candidate won more than 50 percent in the first round.<ep>
   Earlier in the day, when asked about uniting with Yavlinsky, Yeltsin told an Astrakhan crowd, ``We have met with him and we are uniting,'' Russian media reported.<ep>
   But Yavlinsky told the NTV network in Moscow, ``The president's words that we have united don't correspond to reality.''<ep>
   The liberal economist, who trails Zyuganov and Yeltsin significantly in polls, said his talks with Yeltsin last weekend focused on policy, not politics.<ep>
   Yavlinsky had said earlier that he was ready to discuss a coalition with Yeltsin but played down the possibility Friday.<ep>
   ``I have great doubts about this,'' he told Russian television. ``It's too late now, with only 30 days left before the election.''<ep>
   Zyuganov, the Communist front-runner, seemed unconcerned Saturday about a reformist alliance. He told Associated Press Television it would alienate voters and mean ``the end of Yavlinsky's political career.''<ep>
   ``You can't order the voters around,'' Zyuganov said.<ep>
   Yeltsin, meanwhile, rejected Zyuganov's call for a televised debate, calling it a waste of time.<ep>
   ``I was a Communist for 30 years and had so much of that demagogy that today, with my democratic views, I can't bear it any more,'' the president said. ``So I don't need any debates with Zyuganov.''<ep>
