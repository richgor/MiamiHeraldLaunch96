cease-fire monitoring<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   The Clinton administration will bring together diplomats from Syria, Lebanon, Israel and France today to arrange monitoring of the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas.<ep>
   Dennis Ross, senior U.S. troubleshooter for the Middle East, will preside at the meeting in Washington of the countries' ambassadors. <ep>
   The cease-fire was designed not only to halt the fighting but also help reopen the negotiations Israel has held sporadically with Syria and Lebanon since 1991. It calls on Hezbollah not to fire Katyusha rockets into Israel and on Israel not to target civilians in Lebanon.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>MANAMA<m0> (--) An explosion destroyed a house in a Shiite Muslim village, killing a couple and their 3-year-old son. Investigators reportedly blamed the blast on a bomb being built at the house.<ep>
   Four people, including the couple's 5-year-old son, were wounded in the blast Tuesday in the village of Sanabis, which like most Shiite villages in Bahrain has been a center of dissent against the government.<ep>
   It was not immediately known whether the explosion was related to escalating violence on this Persian Gulf island nation caused by Shiite-led opposition demand for the restoration of parliament and more opportunities for Shiites.<ep>

<m1><ue5><m0>Study finds a decline<ql>
in mad cow disease<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   <m0>LONDON<m0> (--) Mad cow disease is ``very much on the wane,'' although Britain can still expect between 15,000 and 24,000 new cases by the end of 1999, a new study predicts.<ep>
   Three-quarters of those cases will occur in animals born since a 1988 ban on feeding cattle with sheep offal, researchers at Oxford University's Department of Zoology found.<ep>
   That's because farmers continued to feed cattle contaminated offal after the ban and because mad cow disease (--) bovine spongiform encephalopathy (--) tends to appear when an animal is 4 or 5 years old, said researcher Dov Stekel.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>JAFFNA<m0> (--) Thousands of Tamils who fled civil war five months ago returned home Wednesday, pushing belongings on carts and bicycles into a city under occupation by the Sri Lankan army.<ep>
   Jaffna was the stronghold of the Tamil separatist rebels and suffered the brunt of Sri Lanka's 12-year war. When the army captured it in December, the city of 120,000 was a ghost town.<ep>
