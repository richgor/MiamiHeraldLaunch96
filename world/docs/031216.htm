   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The TV debate on organized crime was moving along smoothly until panelist ``White Wolf'' got fed up.<P>

   The convicted drug trafficker and reputed gang leader, jabbing his finger at lawmakers sitting across from him, said mobsters were sick of being made scapegoats for political corruption when they were really just ``small potatoes doing the dirty work'' of politicians.<P>

   Coming from Chang An-lo, White Wolf's real name, the complaint carried weight. And it spoke volumes about the interplay of crime and politics in Taiwan.<P>

   Corruption is commonplace in much of Asia, but Taiwan sometimes seems in a league of its own when it comes to collusion between politicians and criminals.<P>

   Investigators say the relationship is simple: The hoods help election campaigns with money and muscle. And the winning politicians repay them with lucrative public works contracts for the companies they control. In some cases, mobsters even get elected themselves.<BR>
Airport expansion<BR>
<P>

   The most sensational case now unfolding involves the Bamboo Union gang and a $210 million project to expand Taipei's international airport.<P>

   Reputed gang member Feng Tsai-cheng has been arrested for intimidating rival contractors into dropping out of bidding for the job. And four Nationalist lawmakers -- including party whip Liao Fu-pen -- have been questioned about allegations that they tried to smooth the way for Feng's construction firm.<P>

   Identified as a leading Bamboo Union member by the Bureau of Investigation, White Wolf was questioned and barred briefly from leaving the island. The bureau has since cleared him of involvement.<P>

   On last month's TV debate, White Wolf denied that gangsters played a big role in the airport bidding. They only helped settle disputes between rival bidders, he said, without elaborating.<BR>
Allied with Nationalists<BR>
<P>

   The biggest beneficiaries of the mob have been the Nationalists, Taiwan's ruling party since 1949, and some question how serious they are about taming the underworld. But as younger, more idealistic officials move into key party positions, older politicians could be forced to crack down on the mob.<P>

   One sign that times may be changing was the way the airport case became public: One of the Nationalists' new breed of ``Mr. Cleans,'' Transport Minister Liu Chao-shiuan, reportedly leaked it to the media.<P>

   After the case was publicized, Liu got vital backing from Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou, whose campaigns against corruption have won him enormous popularity.<P>

   Ma publicly accused mobsters of running for election simply to get their snouts in the public trough, and appealed to the Nationalists for ``a free hand in redressing the social order.''<P>

   Opposition politicians say mobsters control votes through their influence in farm associations and credit unions. They also say gangsters intimidate people, even at gunpoint, from campaigning for rival candidates.<P>

   ``The Nationalists have condoned the crime, fearing a serious crackdown could make the mobsters switch support to the opposition parties,'' said Lee Hsi-kun, a political science professor at National Taiwan University.<BR>
Speaks from experience<BR>
<P>

   Lee, a Nationalist, knows what he's talking about. He freely admits soliciting gang support for his failed 1989 run for Taipei county chief.<P>

   ``As long as politicians want votes more than social justice,'' he said, ``mobsters will survive and prosper.''<P>

   ``Mobsters have formed the bottom block of the Nationalist hierarchy,'' says lawmaker Lin Chu-shui of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. ``The empire will collapse if they are purged.''<P>

   Taiwan's ambitious infrastructure projects offer rich plunder for the underworld. Federal investigators say mobsters usually muscle-out legitimate bidders for public works, then subcontract the job piecemeal to smaller firms without even bothering to cover their tracks.<P>

   But the public is much more sensitive today about how its money is being spent -- and wherever the mob barges in, the result is higher costs, delays and shoddy workmanship. And because Taiwan is now a democracy, residents can more freely air their complaints in public.<BR>
Foreigners deterred<BR>
<P>

   Then there's the question of image. Economics Minister Chiang Ping-kun has warned that the mob's activities deter foreigners from investing in Taiwan.<P>

   Taiwan also wants its powerhouse economy to be an example to arch-rival China.<P>

   As the China News editorialized: ``A society under the shadow of the underworld can't claim to be a model for others.''
