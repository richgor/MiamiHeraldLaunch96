   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The pace is Austrian-fast, the shoes are Italian-stylish and the economic drive is positively German in its strength.<P>

   Is this a country that just fought a war for independence and is still uncomfortably close to a region that has suffered one of the bloodiest conflicts in recent history? <P>

   Just a little over four years of age, the new nation of Slovenia is making remarkable progress in developing its economy and separating itself from the nasty battle near its borders. <P>

   Slovenia tiptoed out of troublesome Yugoslavia so sneakily that many Westerners don't even know it used to be one of six Yugoslav republics. A 10-day war against the Serbs in 1991, and it was all over.<P>

   Slovenia got its independence and left the border disputes to its neighbors. Not that Slovenia wants Westerners -- especially potential investors and tourists -- to even think about the fact that it borders Croatia and is a day-trip from Sarajevo.<P>

   ``Slovenia does not belong to the Balkans,'' a government promotional brochure insists. <P>

   Geographers might disagree. The tiny nation of two million people is, in fact, on the northwest of the Balkan peninsula. But in attitude and national mood, the ``Balkans'' are a world away.<P>

   ``Nobody talks about the war'' in Bosnia, which is now at uneasy peace, said Bojan Smolnikar, who owns a restaurant on Lake Bled, a tourist spot popular with Slovenes and foreigners. <P>

Convertible currency<P>

   While people on the other side of the border still buy goods on the black market, Slovenes have an impressive choice of Western products and international stores. While the ``Balkan'' people hoard and trade hard currency, Slovenes withdraw their tolars from electronic bank machines in the bustling capital of Ljubljana.<P>

   While unspeakable horrors were reported in the nearby war, Slovenia has seen no fighting since 1991. Its biggest war casualty was its export economy. Slovenia, like other nations, lost Yugoslavia as a trading partner when the international sanctions were imposed. The sanctions were finally lifted after last year's Dayton peace agreement.<P>

   But even there, Slovenia has recovered well. Its gross domestic product grew 5.5 percent last year, and is expected to expand at a similar rate. The average income is the highest in Central Europe, and is between Greece and Portugal among Western European nations. Inflation, U.S. Embassy officials predict, may come in at a single-digit rate at the end of the year. Exports are down, but for a happy reason, says the Information Ministry.<P>

   It's because the tolar has gotten consistently stronger. And if the peace holds, Slovenia may be the only former Yugoslav republic to profit: A group of 30 officials from Mostar, a war-devastated town in Bosnia, visited Ljubljana weeks before the war officially ended to find construction firms to help in the rebuilding process. Always the most prosperous of the six former Yugoslav republics, Slovenia is now in the best position to win contracts to reconstruct what war has destroyed. <P>

Big potential for tourism<P>

   One of Slovenia's best economic hopes is tourism. Seen up close, Slovenia is a tourist's paradise. Visitors can ski or hike in the Julian Alps and dine at an Adriatic coastal town the same day. Ljubljana, the capital, has an active art and music scene.<P>

   But on paper, particularly paper that has a map drawn on it, Slovenia is a tougher place to sell. Tourism is down because of the war, and many tourist companies stopped bringing groups to the country. Tourist office brochures downplay the country's location.<P>

   A map of the area around Slovenia features Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy and other safe-sounding countries, with just a small corner of neighboring Croatia visible. <P>

   Unfortunately, there's often confusion with Slavonia, a region of Croatia that had been held by the Serbs and was a hotly contested territory in the peace talks.<P>

   When Lidija Gabrijelcic, spokeswoman for the growing Ljubljana Stock Exchange, was in New York City recently, she heard: ``Slovenia? Are you getting bombed?'' <P>

   ``I have to explain it to them. Maybe 2 percent of the people I talked with even know what Slovenia is.''
