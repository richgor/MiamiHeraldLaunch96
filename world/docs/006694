   NEW DELHI (--) India's rival political groups clamored for power Friday after a general election that shattered the traditional base of the Congress Party.<ep>
   The vote gave new leverage to a tumultuous assemblage of groups representing the mosaic of <m4>Rao<m2><ql>
<m0>castes, regions and languages in this nation of 930 million people.<ep>
   With results nearly complete, India appeared to have crossed a watershed. The India dominated by the Congress Party for most of the 49 years since independence seemed to have given way to a new, more fractious period in which the country would wear many political faces reflecting its ancient diversities.<ep>
   The election ended with the most fragmented Parliament in India's history, with no group coming close to a governing majority. The Congress Party lost more than half the seats it held in the last Parliament, and was left with less than a quarter of the membership of the 545-seat body.<ep>
   Party leaders acknowledged that it was a debacle without precedent in the history of the 110-year-old party and one in which, in the words of Sharad Pawar, one of the party's most powerful figures, ``the masses of the people have gone away from us.''<ep>
   Two of the major gainers in the election demanded the chance to form the new government (--) the Bharatiya Janata Party, a right-wing Hindu nationalist group; and a coalition of leftist, centrist and regional parties known as the National Front-Left Front. But with both groups dozens of seats short of a majority in Parliament, the stage seemed to be set for days of bitter infighting, with numerous aspirants for the prime minister's post.<ep>
   The resignation Friday night of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, whose aloof campaigning style came to symbolize a party that seemed out of touch with the country's mood, seemed almost like a footnote at a time of hectic maneuvering.<ep>
   As a disconsolate Rao presided over the last meeting of a Cabinet reduced to a rump by corruption scandals and election defeats, more than a dozen parties engaged in a helter-skelter round of negotiations and blandishments aimed at securing a share of power. <ep>
   The Congress Party had bad periods before, especially when it was ousted from power in 1977 after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's seizure of emergency powers. But even party veterans seemed to think there would be no quick recovery this time.<ep>
   Instead, the election seemed to confirm that the Nehrus and the Gandhis, the commanding figures of the past, will be replaced by a babel of unfamiliar voices.<ep>
