   NEW DELHI (--) The party that has dominated India politics for nearly 50 years admitted defeat Thursday in parliamentary elections. An opposition party that has pledged to restore ``Hindu values'' began seeking partners for a coalition government.<ep>
   But early returns were unclear about who would govern, and the country appeared headed for a period of political uncertainty.<ep>
   ``We accept defeat, there is no denial of this fact that people have rejected us,'' said Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee, campaign manager for the Congress Party, which has led Indian politics since independence in 1947.<ep>
   The Hindu opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, which advocates nuclear armament and tighter control of foreign investment in India, will overtake the Congress Party for the first time in the 545-seat Parliament, according to exit polls.<ep>
   Buoyed by the polls and voting trends, the Hindu party said it had begun putting out feelers for governing partners.<ep>
   ``The Bharatiya Janata Party is drawing up a common minimum program to negotiate with regional parties,'' said spokesman K.R. Malkani.<ep>
   Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao of the Congress Party was leading in his voting district. But some of his former ministers were trailing.<ep>
   One-third of India's 590 million voters were eligible to cast ballots Tuesday in the third round of the monthlong election.<ep>
   Police reported Wednesday that 20 people were killed Tuesday in election-related violence, including five police officers who died in a land mine explosion. In all, 90 people have died in violence linked to the balloting.<ep>
   In hundreds of counting centers Wednesday, election officials broke the wax seals on ballot boxes and tediously unfolded newspaper-sized ballots to begin tallying an estimated 300 million votes. Final results were not expected until the weekend.<ep>
   With 271 districts reporting partial results, Congress was leading in 90 and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was ahead in 81 seats. The National Front was running third with 30 seats. The rest were going to regional parties and independents.<ep>
   But the trends showed Congress trailing in 93 seats that it had won in the 1991 election, while the BJP and the National Front both showed gains.<ep>
   Even if it is the largest party, the BJP group may have trouble finding partners.<ep>
   The National Front and other large parties have said they will not join the Hindu party, which they perceive as anti-Muslim and which they accuse of provoking Hindu-Muslim riots in 1992 that killed thousands of people.<ep>
   The National Front, an alliance of leftist, low-caste and regional parties, is in a strong bargaining position for a role in the coalition.<ep>
   ``There will be no government without us,'' said the National Front's V.P. Singh, who was prime minister for 11 months during one of the two brief interludes since independence when Congress was not in power.<ep>
   The early returns were coming mostly from southern India, which had been a Congress stronghold. Counting begins today for key northern states where Congress was expected to do much worse than in the south.<ep>
