   MONROVIA, Liberia -- (AP) -- Liberia's rebels, many of them teenagers armed with machine guns, fought furious street battles Saturday, shattering hopes that the evacuation of warlord Roosevelt Johnson would spur moves toward peace.<P>

   The fresh violence came a day after U.S. Marines airlifted Johnson to Ghana for peace talks. But archrival Charles Taylor vowed not to abandon his forces to attend the talks. And Johnson's men continued to fight without him.<P>

   The warfare was the worst since a 10-day cease-fire crumbled Monday. Two main bridges leading into Monrovia were under heavy fire. Taylor's forces repeatedly shelled the military barracks that Johnson had seized and occupied for the last month.<P>

   ``The fighting now going on is intended to diminish the ability of Johnson's men to make war,'' Taylor said at his headquarters in the suburb of Congo Town.<P>

   Taylor said he had no intention of joining Johnson in Accra, Ghana, for talks to begin Wednesday on ending the 6-year-old Liberian war. ``I welcome the process to have Gen. Johnson evacuated and hope that the electoral process will go on as planned in August this year,'' he said.<P>

   Taylor recently aligned his forces with warlord Alhaji Kromah, once a bitter rival. Both men are on Liberia's governing council, which was formed Sept. 1 after international mediators brokered the country's 13th peace accord in six years of civil war.<P>

   The council was designed to prepare Liberia for elections by August. Taylor said the council's civilian chairman, Wilton Sankawulo, would represent Liberia at the peace talks.<P>

   The U.S. State Department said Saturday that the failure of any faction leader to attend the peace talks would be regarded as ``evidence of an unwillingness to support the peace process.'' The White House is sending U.S. special envoy Dane Smith to attend the talks.<P>

   Johnson, who had been barricaded in the military barracks since April 6, was hustled in an armored convoy to the U.S. Embassy on Friday. A U.S. helicopter flew him to neighboring Sierra Leone and then to Accra Friday night.<P>

   It was unclear whether Johnson considered his departure a surrender or whether he planned to return to Monrovia after the peace talks.<P>

   Johnson's evacuation was the outcome of two days of diplomatic efforts involving U.N., U.S. and peacekeeping officials.<P>

   A truce negotiated April 19 collapsed 10 days later. Efforts to start peace talks increased in urgency Thursday when Taylor vowed an all-out assault on Johnson.
