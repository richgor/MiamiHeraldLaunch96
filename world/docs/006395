   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (--) When the Serb-controlled Sarajevo suburb of Ilidza reverted to Muslim-Croat government control several weeks ago, a hardy group of Bosnian Serb doctors and health workers vowed to remain behind. <ep>
   Resisting pressure from their own hard-line leaders, they pledged to work with the new government and help rebuild Bosnia.<ep>
   International mediators promised they'd be safe and praised them as a model of inter-ethnic cooperation in peacetime Bosnia.<ep>
   And then, the Muslim-led government in effect fired them.<ep>
   In addition, the government dismissed 12 of Ilidza's 15 schoolteachers, according to the office of the European Union's high representative, which is in charge of implementing civilian aspects of the peace accord that ended the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 12 were Serbs; the three who were spared were a Muslim and two Croats.<ep>
<m0>Divisions remain<ep>
<m0>   The Sarajevo government's actions are part of what diplomats say is a disturbing trend toward the same kind of radical nationalism that has characterized Serbian and Croatian regimes in the past and fueled ethnic-based warfare.<ep>
   It raises serious questions about the Bosnian government's professed commitment to ethnic diversity and tolerance (--) its stock in trade through the last four years of war. And it has disillusioned many of the government's longtime supporters, as well as more recent partners in peace like NATO.<ep>
   ``Despite what they went through, it is not easy to tell them to play by the rules,'' said Michael Steiner, a German diplomat who is the No. 2 official in the high representative's office. ``But it is absolutely necessary that Sarajevo become a model for a multiethnic society. That is the only thing that holds the country together.''<ep>
   The signs are discouraging.<ep>
   International officials who have long complained of the obstructionism they encounter from hard-line Bosnian Serb leaders like indicted war crimes suspects Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, are increasingly objecting to the attitudes and actions of the Muslim nationalists attempting to dominate the Sarajevo government.<ep>
<m0>Hard-line group<ep>
<m0>   This cadre from President Alija Izetbegovic's Party of Democratic Action, diplomats say, has little real interest in the ideals of multiethnic tolerance publicly proclaimed by leaders like Prime Minister Hasan Muratovic. <ep>
   Under the party's direction, a regional parliament devised for the Sarajevo area gave 35 of 37 seats to Muslims. The scheme so outraged the Muslim mayor of Sarajevo, Tarik Kupusovic, that he resigned in protest.<ep>
   The hard-liners are also thought to be responsible for the government's continued violation of the accord's requirement that all foreign fighters be removed from Bosnia. A number of Iranians remain, and a secretive Iranian-trained intelligence agency is still active despite U.S. demands that it be reined in.<ep>
   And the party has complicated negotiations over upcoming elections, objecting to plans to allow refugees to vote where they currently live and accusing international election monitors of sanctioning ``ethnic cleansing,'' sources say.<ep>
<m0>First signs of trouble<ep>
<m0>   It was in the handling of Sarajevo suburbs like Ilidza that the government's motives and intentions were first challenged.<ep>
   The Bosnian Serb leadership put a disastrous chain of events in motion by whipping up residents' fears about the incoming leaders and triggering an exodus. But the Sarajevo government exacerbated the situation by failing to offer adequate guarantees, such as an amnesty law that would benefit the Serbs of Sarajevo.<ep>
   The day after Ilidza was put under Muslim-Croat federation control, scores of Muslim refugees barged into Serbian-owned homes and claimed them as their own. Six weeks later, the refugees remain, despite a government promise to evict them. And an internationally brokered agreement to include Serbs in the interim Ilidza government has been ignored.<ep>
   Steiner complained about the treatment given the Ilidza doctors, who in a way were a personal project of his. During the hand-over of Ilidza in March, when thousands of Serbs were mounting their violent exodus, Steiner personally and publicly assured the doctors that they and their jobs would be safe if they had the courage to remain. Bosnian Ministry of Health officials offered similar promises.<ep>
   The doctors remained. Then the government told them there was no work for them.<ep>
