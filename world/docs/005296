<m0>   UNITED NATIONS (--) (AP) (--) Despite a report suggesting that Israel intentionally fired on a U.N. camp in Lebanon, Arab diplomats are finding little support on the U.N. Security Council for a strong condemnation.<ep>
   On Wednesday, the day after the U.N. report was released, Lebanese Ambassador Samir Moubarak said he would submit a resolution denouncing Israel for the April 18 shelling of the U.N. garrison at Qana, which killed at least 91 civilians.<ep>
   Israel has said the shelling was accidental, and that its fire was aimed at Hezbollah guerrilla positions near the camp.<ep>
   The U.N. report said the pattern of artillery shell hits ``is inconsistent with a normal overshooting'' and that ``it is unlikely'' the barrage on the U.N. compound was an accident.<ep>
   But after a full day of lobbying, an Arab diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said that only four of the 15 Security Council members (--) China, Guinea-Bissau, Egypt and Honduras (--) were prepared to support Lebanon's resolution.<ep>
