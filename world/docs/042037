U.N. base in Lebanon<ql>

<m0>   JERUSALEM (--) (AP) (--) An amateur videotape aired Monday has reinforced claims that Israeli artillery deliberately struck a U.N. base in Lebanon where at least 91 civilians died last month.<ep>
   Israeli officials had said the base was mistakenly hit by one or two stray rounds. Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, Israel's deputy chief of staff, conceded Sunday it could have been hit by as many as five shells.<ep>
   A preliminary report by U.N. investigators says the remains of 15 shells were found at the base near the village of Qana in southern Lebanon.<ep>
   The videotape, taken by a U.N. peacekeeper a mile away, shows a series of puffs of smoke emerging from the base, indicating when shells hit.<ep>
   ``The importance of the tape is that it shows the shelling is not one or two rounds that overshot, as we've been told for the past two weeks . . . but that it was a targeted shelling,'' said Timor Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon.<ep>
   Goksel did not speculate why the base might have been targeted.<ep>
   ``It's up to the Israeli side to explain, I think,'' he told Britain's Sky Television.<ep>
   Israel insisted the shelling of the base was an accident and sent a top army officer to the United Nations in New York to explain. Brig. Gen. Dan Harel brought aerial photographs and technical data, including logs of the two batteries that fired the shells, in an attempt to convince the United Nations that the attack was an accident.<ep>
   The rounds fell short because of mistakes in calculating range and the weight of the projectiles, Israeli officials said.<ep>
   Even if the Israelis had seen Hezbollah guerrillas seeking shelter in the camp, ``we wouldn't shoot at it,'' Harel told reporters in New York. ``This is a U.N. camp and we put parameters of safety around each and every U.N. compound in south Lebanon when the operation was going on.''<ep>
   ``We made a mistake and we are terribly sorry,'' Prime Minister Shimon Peres said at a campaign stop. ``We regret it . . . But, in my opinion, everything was done according to clear logic and in a responsible way. I am at peace with it.''<ep>
   Vilnai said Israel knew that as many as 9,000 refugees were housed in U.N. bases throughout southern Lebanon, but had no indication there were any at the Qana base.<ep>
   Peres insisted the United Nations shared some of the blame for letting Hezbollah establish positions near the base. Israel radio said Israel would protest to the head of U.N. forces in Lebanon for letting Hezbollah operate freely from their bases.<ep>
   The British Broadcasting Corp., which aired the amateur video, said the U.N. investigation revealed that Hezbollah guerrillas were allowed to take shelter at the base shortly after firing on Israeli positions.<ep>
   The videotape also shows an Israeli reconnaissance drone, or remote-piloted aircraft, flying near the base during the shelling, contradicting Israel's initial assertion that there was no aircraft in the area.<ep>
   Israel government spokesman Uri Dromi said Israeli gunners had different coordinates than the officers who approved the attack. He said the drone was on a different mission at the time of the shelling but could not see the civilians because they were indoors.<ep>
