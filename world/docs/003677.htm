   THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The first international war crimes trial since World War II began here Tuesday amid a sense of anticipation and history but with troubling questions hanging in the air and a small-time Bosnian Serb political operator named Dusan Tadic as the lone defendant.<P>

   ``This trial has clear historic dimensions, but we must all remember that first and foremost this is a criminal trial,'' said presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, an American law professor and former federal court judge.<P>

   Tuesday's trial began more than two years after the court -- formally known as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia -- was established by the United Nations to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed during the brutal Balkans conflict. It has also been more than two years since Tadic was arrested in Munich.<P>

   Most of the first day was consumed by opening arguments in the case against the 41-year-old Tadic, who is accused of murdering, beating, torturing and otherwise persecuting Muslims, mainly in three northern Bosnia concentration camps during the initial chaotic months after the war there began in April 1992.<P>

   In the course of a one-hour and 50-minute opening statement, prosecutor Grant Nie<BR>
mann, an Australian, said he would take the tribunal on ``a journey of unspeakable horrors'' as he presented the 31 counts of crimes against humanity, violations of the laws and customs of war, and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions contained in the formal indictment against Tadic, who is also known as Dusko.<P>

   As Niemann spoke, the defendant looked pale and seemed nervous as he listened through an interpreter. Tadic's chief defense attorney, a prominent Dutch trial lawyer named Michail Wladimiroff, suggested that his client was the innocent victim of an international search for revenge.<BR>
Defense claims<BR>
<P>

   Wladimiroff said he would prove that someone else, not Tadic, committed the crimes of which he is accused. He described his client as a deserter from the Bosnian Serb cause who fled to Germany, where he was eventually arrested.<P>

   ``The thirst of revenge must not be satisfied at the well of polluted justice,'' he told the court.<P>

   Wladimiroff said the defense is working at an extreme disadvantage, because all its witnesses still live in Serb-controlled parts of Bosnia and are intimidated by strong anti-tribunal sentiment there. By contrast, all of the more than 80 prosecution witnesses now live outside Serb areas, he said.<P>

   It was the prosecution, however, that appeared to suffer most from the problem of witness intimidation, at least initially. It was forced to drop an additional charge of rape against Tadic three days before the trial began when the victim suddenly decided not to testify, apparently after threats were made to her family.<P>

   The development is considered significant setback to the prosecution, because it would have marked the first treatment of rape as a war crime. It would also have addressed the issue of how rape was used in the Bosnian war as a tactic to instill terror in the civilian population.<P>

   The tribunal's biggest shortcoming to date has been its failure to gain custody of the 57 persons it has indicted.<BR>
Six others in custody<BR>
<P>

   Besides Tadic, only six other defendants are in custody, two more in The Netherlands, two in Germany and two in Bosnia. Big names, such as Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military leader Ratko Mladic, remain at large.<P>

   The start of Tuesday's trial brought inevitable comparisons with the last war crimes trials, in Tokyo and Nuremburg, Germany. Advocates of The Hague tribunal see it as a major advancement on the World War II courts because it is not composed of victors but is an international body made up of representatives from nations not directly involved in the Bosnian war.
