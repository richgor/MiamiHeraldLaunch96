<m0>   MOSCOW (--) (AP) (--) Russian officials have arrested a Russian man who confessed to spying for Britain and plan to expel several British diplomats who had contact with him, authorities said Monday.<ep>
   ``The man was seized red-handed as he was in the process of communicating with his headquarters,'' said Boris Kostenko, spokesman for Russia's Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB.<ep>
   A search produced ``a spy's equipment,'' he added, without elaborating.<ep>
   The man admitted he was spying for the British Intelligence Service and told the agents about his recruitment and contacts with British intelligence officers, Kostenko said.<ep>
   Kostenko would not give the man's name, date of arrest or any other details.<ep>
   British officials in Moscow would not comment on the allegations.<ep>
   The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed ``a resolute protest'' to British Ambassador Andrew Wood over the use of diplomatic cover by British intelligence officers, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.<ep>
   A Foreign Ministry official informed Wood that ``a number of English intelligence officers who hold diplomatic posts in Great Britain's embassy in Moscow'' will be told to leave Russia for maintaining contact with the agent, ITAR-Tass said.<ep>
   In London, after refusing to comment at all for several hours, the Foreign Office said in a statement: ``Until there is an official Russian statement we have no comment to make, but we regard the kind of allegations being made as completely unjustified.''<ep>
