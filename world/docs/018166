   TABA, Egypt (--) Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians entered their final phase Sunday, with both sides set to face their toughest conflicts: the future of Jerusalem and Jewish settlement on the West Bank.<ep>
   Those issues, which date back to the founding of the Jewish state, have been put off through five years of historic talks (--) talks that have so far produced two peace accords and a Nobel Peace Prize shared among PLO leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and his slain predecessor Yitzhak Rabin.<ep>
   Palestinian delegate Saeb Erakat said the talks that started Sunday are ``the beginning of a new era in our peace process . . . the real negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.''<ep>
   ``Let's say that for the past five years we've been having appetizers,'' he said. This final phase of talks is expected to last at least three years.<ep>
   Israeli chief negotiator Uri Savir and top Palestinian delegate Mahmoud Abbas opened the session by warning violent extremists on both sides that they cannot stop the process. Top Israeli security officials cautioned on Sunday of impending suicide attacks by militants who oppose the peace process.<ep>
   ``You belong to the past,'' Abbas said during his speech. ``You will lose for we are determined to win.''<ep>
   The opening session was largely symbolic, scheduled to meet a deadline for starting ``final status'' talks. Serious negotiations are not expected to begin until after Israel's May 29 national elections.<ep>
   But the agenda, which includes discussion of the possibility of a state of Palestine, demonstrates how far the two sides have come since peace talks started in 1991. Before that, Israel would not even talk to the PLO, let alone discuss a Palestinian state.<ep>
   Still, Savir has recommended a go-slow approach, starting with easier issues and leaving tougher questions, like the status of Jerusalem, for later.<ep>
   Israel insists that the city (--) which is holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims (--) remain its undivided capital. The Palestinians, while not urging division of the city, demand their capital be the eastern Arab sector of Jerusalem captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.<ep>
   Palestinians are eager to build on the two agreements already in place, as well as to force Israel to make good on promises that have gone unfulfilled, such as the withdrawal of Israeli soldiers from the West Bank town of Hebron.<ep>
   Another key conflict is Jewish settlers.<ep>
   The Palestinians demand the more than 140,000 Jewish settlers leave the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. But Israel has shied away from the subject for fear of alienating the settlers, who believe they have a biblical mission to occupy the land.<ep>
   Talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization of Yasser Arafat began in earnest in October 1991 after the Gulf War. They signed a ``declaration of principles'' on the White House lawn in 1993, and went on to complete two pacts.<ep>
   The first pact, known as the Cairo Accord, was signed May 4, 1994. It gave the Palestinians autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.<ep>
   The second accord, known as the Taba Pact, was signed Sept. 28, 1995. It expanded autonomy to the rest of the towns and villages in the West Bank and established a further Israeli troop withdrawal schedule from lands the Jewish state has occupied since 1967.<ep>
   But a number of pledges still haven't been fulfilled.<ep>
   The so-called safe passages promised by Israel in 1994 to link the autonomous Palestinian areas have not yet been set up. Palestinian prisoners still remain in Israeli jails. And Israel has not withdrawn its forces from Hebron, fearing violence that could affect the national elections.<ep>
   After a Cabinet meeting Sunday, Peres said he would decide later this week when to proceed with the Hebron withdrawal.<ep>
   The city is home to 94,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish militant settlers, who demand Israeli protection and vow to fight any effort to remove them.<ep>
