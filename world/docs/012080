<m0>   UNITED NATIONS (--) (AP) (--) The bankrupt United Nations is holding a $150,000 meeting on decolonization in the Pacific even though most of the islands aren't even seeking full independence.<ep>
   The U.N. decolonization committee will hold the seminar in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, on June 12-14 to discuss the problems of decolonization.<ep>
   The United States administers Guam and American Samoa, New Zealand administers Tokelau, Britain governs Pitcairn and the St. Helena islands, and France is responsible for New Caledonia.<ep>
   East Timor seeks independence. Indonesia seized the former Portuguese colony in 1976 and annexed it in 1977. In addition, rebels on the island of Bougainville have been fighting for independence from Papua New Guinea.<ep>
   Many nations are questioning the need for the meeting, especially after the United Nations' regular operating budget ran dry on Tuesday. The United States, Germany and Japan are all in arrears in paying their dues.<ep>
   Chief U.N. financial officer Joseph Connor said he would borrow $50 million from the separate peacekeeping fund to pay the bills. The United Nations already owes about $1 billion to the fund.<ep>
   On Tuesday, the undersecretary-general for political affairs, Marrack Goulding, said officials had asked the committee whether the Papua New Guinea meeting made sense. Goulding said the committee responded that funds for the meeting had already been allocated.<ep>
   The decolonization committee was established soon after World War II, and emerged as a champion of peoples seeking independence from colonial powers.<ep>
   But dozens of former colonies and territories are now independent, and many U.N. members ask whether the committee is still needed. One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the committee has outlived its usefulness and that the meeting contradicts the needs of fiscal reform.<ep>
   U.N. officials say they have no authority to abolish or curtail the work of the committee unless the 185-member U.N. General Assembly authorizes them to do so. The General Assembly, where every U.N. member has an equal vote, continues to finance the committee over the objections of the United States, Britain and France.<ep>
