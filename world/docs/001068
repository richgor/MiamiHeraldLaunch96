   TABA, Egypt (--) Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on Sunday formally opened the final and most difficult stage of their search for a comprehensive peace settlement, the ``final status'' talks that require them to resolve their most bitter differences within three years.<ep>
   The meeting was timed to meet the deadline for the start of the final round of talks as set out in the Israeli-Palestinian agreements signed in September 1993 and September 1995. Those agreements declare that the final settlement must be reached by May 1999.<ep>
   In their opening speeches, the leaders of each delegation combined ringing phrases about the historic significance of the moment with distinct outlines of the main battle lines.<ep>
   Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian team who is better known as Abu Mazen, said it was ``high time for Israel to remove any obstacle to the establishment of a Palestinian state next to Israel,'' with East Jerusalem as its capital.<ep>
   Uri Savir, the director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and Prime Minister Shimon Peres' senior negotiator with the Arabs, described Israel's goal as the separation of the two peoples while seeking ``cooperation in an atmosphere of mutual respect and dignity.'' At the same time, Savir said Israel's priority was its security, and that it intended to retain Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel.<ep>
<m1>Elections could affect outcome<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   One unspoken understanding was that real negotiations would not start until after the Israeli elections on May 29, and it was clear to both sides that their subsequent shape would depend on whether Peres, the Israeli architect of the process, was re-elected. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Peres' opponent, Benjamin Netanyahu of the conservative Likud party, has expressed general support for the agreements reached so far, but few Israelis believe he would stay with the blueprint mapped out by Peres and his late predecessor, Yitzhak Rabin, with Yasser Arafat and his Palestine Liberation Organization.<ep>
   The three-stage process they started at the White House in September 1993 called first for the Palestinians to take control of the Gaza Strip and Jericho, and second, to expand self-rule to other cities and towns of the West Bank. That has now been largely achieved.<ep>
<m1>Tough issues remain<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   The most intractable and the most important issues have been saved for last: the status of Jerusalem, the fate of some three million Palestinian refugees, the fate of Jewish settlements in Palestinian areas, the final borders between the Israelis and Palestinians, security arrangements and vital economic questions like trade and the sharing of water.<ep>
   Members of both teams, all veterans of previous negotiations, were clearly aware of the enormous obstacles ahead. The choice of Taba, an Egyptian resort on the Red Sea adjoining Israel, was already a compromise, and the format of the talks reportedly remained unsettled.<ep>
<m1>Different strategies<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   The Palestinians were described as wanting to break immediately into committees on each issue, which they thought would lend authority to their claims on statehood and Jerusalem. Savir reportedly preferred to start with small and private sessions of ``conceptual brainstorming'' to devise a strategy for approaching the main issues.<ep>
   Abu Mazen voiced some of the frustrations that have accumulated among the Palestinians over Israel's failure to carry out some parts of the agreement. He said there was still no safe-passage route between Gaza and the West Bank, prisoners and detainees had not been released on schedule, and Israeli troops had not yet withdrawn from Hebron.<ep>
<m1>Both sides want peace<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   Despite some mutual sniping, both Savir and Abu Mazen spoke of a determination to bring the process to its end, and both denounced opponents who sought to undermine it through terror.<ep>
   ``To terrorists on both sides, we say: Stop, stop, for you stand no chance to gain your ends,'' Abu Mazen said. ``You belong to the past.''<ep>
   Savir said, ``Conciliation and accommodation shall prevail as terrorists take their last breath.''<ep>
