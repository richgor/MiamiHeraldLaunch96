<m0>   MADRID (--) (AP) (--) Luis Miguel Dominguin, a bullfighter whose rivalry with his brother-in-law was chronicled by Ernest Hemingway, died Wednesday. He was 69.<ep>
   Dominguin had stomach cancer and died of a stroke at his farm near San Roque, Spain.<ep>
   His steely nerves and dark, lean looks attracted <m4>Dominguin<m2><ql>
<m0>many women, including actresses such as Ava Gardner.<ep>
   Hemingway wrote of the rivalry between Dominguin and Antonio Ordon~ez in <m0>The Dangerous Summer.<m0> <ep>
   ``Bullfighting is worthless without rivalry. ``But with two great bullfighters, it becomes a deadly rivalry,'' he wrote, because the one-upmanship can force a matador to go beyond his abilities. <ep>
   That dangerous summer of 1959 ended with Dominguin being gored in the thigh. He recovered and continued fighting until 1973.<ep>
   For years, Dominguin had a relationship with Gardner. He was also reportedly involved with Brigitte Bardot, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, Olivia de Havilland and Zsa Zsa Gabor.<ep>
   He befriended artist Pablo Picasso and playwright Jean Cocteau and went on hunting trips with Gen. Francisco Franco.<ep>
   Hemingway disliked his showmanship: Dominguin sometimes would kiss a stunned, wounded bull before dispatching it. He also shocked critics in the 1940s by raising his right index finger in the air in the bullring to proclaim himself No. 1.<ep>
   In 1955, Dominguin married Italian actress Lucia Bose. Their <m1> <m0>son Miguel is a pop star and actor.<ep>
   After separating, Dominguin married Rosario Primo de Rivera. He is survived by his wife, three children and four grandchildren.<ep>
