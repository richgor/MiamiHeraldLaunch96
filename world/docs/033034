<m0>   <m0>GROZNY<m0> (--) Chechen rebels shot down a Russian Su-25 warplane Sunday, killing its two pilots, and kidnapped 11 police officers of the Moscow-backed Chechen government.<ep>
   Also Sunday, the leader of the rebels rejected a Russian offer for peace talks, but a standoff between rebels in Shali and Russian troops besieging the town for nearly two weeks was reportedly settled with Chechens handing over their weapons.<ep>
   The Russian jet fighter was brought down Sunday morning during a reconnaissance mission near the eastern village of Mairtup, Defense Ministry officials told The Associated Press. <ql>

<m0>   <m0>JAMMU <m0>(--) Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao vowed Sunday to go ahead with this month's elections in rebellious Jammu-Kashmir despite ``interference by Pakistan,'' which supports Kashmiri separatists.<ep>
   It was the first visit by a prime minister to the northern state since the Muslim insurgency began in 1989. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, a mainly Muslim territory that straddles their border.<ep>
   Winding up an election campaign in Jammu for this month's general elections, Rao said he did not rule out ``more mischief by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir to thwart the poll.'' Militants have urged Kashmiris to boycott the election.<ql>
