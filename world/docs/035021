<m0>   TOKYO (--) Henry Wallace, a former Ford Motor Co. executive taking the wheel at cash-strapped Mazda Motor Corp., vowed Thursday to maintain the Mazda image despite cost-reduction plans for the two automakers to share more parts and platforms.<ep>
   ``As president, I'm custodian of the Mazda image,'' said Wallace, wearing a shiny blue Mazda pin on his breast.<ep>
   Wallace denied that Mazda will dwindle, possibly into a small-car division of Ford Motor Co., as speculated by some.<ep>
   Last month, Ford announced that it would increase its stake in Mazda to 33.4 percent from 24.5 percent with a $480 million investment, taking virtual control of Mazda.<ep>
   Wallace, 50, a former Ford Venezuela president who became executive vice president of the Japanese company in 1994, was named Mazda president, effective next month. He replaces Yoshihiro Wada, who will become chairman.<ep>
   Since becoming the first foreigner to head a Japanese automaker, Wallace has received intense coverage from the local press.<ep>
   He has set off headlines like: ``Mazda a Big Hell of Firings,'' and ``Passive Employees Can't Keep Up,'' reflecting widespread fears that an American-style management of layoffs and performance-oriented promotions would shake up Mazda.<ep>
   Wallace said his style of management encourages open debate and denied that any massive layoffs are in the works.<ep>
   The soft-spoken Wallace, a Scotsman, acknowledged he didn't understand the Japanese language very well. Remarks to Japanese reporters earlier, for example, had been misquoted, he said.<ep>
   Wallace denied reports Thursday that said he would be naming someone from Ford to oversee supplies. Some changes will be made, he said, but they will be minor.<ep>
   The No. 2 U.S. automaker has said the greater collaboration with Mazda will help it gain footage in the growing Asian market. Mazda produces cars in many Asian countries, including Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines.<ep>
   Wallace declined to discuss specifics of the collaboration, including cost-reduction or model plans.<ep>
   In the past, Ford has benefited from its close relationship with Mazda, jointly developing cars, sharing distribution networks, exchanging technology. That will continue, Wallace said.<ep>
   Mazda lost $380 million in its fiscal year ended March 1995, but has started a cost-cutting program of reducing models and sales channels.<ep>
   Analysts say Mazda's earnings report for the year that just ended, expected next week, might show it broke even.<ep>
