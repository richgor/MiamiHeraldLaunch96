<m0>   NEW DELHI (--) (AP) (--) After guiding India's 50-year transformation from a colonial backwater to a rising Third World power, the secular Congress Party conceded Thursday that it lost a parliamentary election to Hindu nationalists.<ep>
   Political blunders and social changes combined to topple the Congress Party and Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.<ep>
   As Rao began preparing his resignation, the biggest winner in three days of voting, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), started seeking partners to form a coalition government.<ep>
   But incomplete election returns (--) and troubles the party could have in forming an alliance (--) left it <m4>Rao<m2><ql>
<m0>unclear who would govern the world's most populous democracy.<ep>
   Rao is expected to submit his resignation after a Cabinet meeting today.<ep>
   Because no party won a majority, President Shankar Dayal Sharma has some discretion in choosing which party gets the first chance to form the next government.<ep>
   On the second day of counting, computer projections said the BJP and its allies would emerge with up to 185 of 537 contested seats. The National Front, an alliance of socialist, regional and low-caste Hindu parties, was projected to win 140 to 150 seats. Congress was expected to take 130 to 140 seats.<ep>
   More than 80 seats were likely to go to small regional parties and independents, and the leading parties began wooing them as potential coalition partners. Final results were not expected until the weekend.<ep>
   Both Congress and the National Front have said they would not join a government led by the BJP, which shocked India in 1992 by supporting Hindu extremists who set off deadly Hindu-Muslim riots.<ep>
   Since independence in 1947, Congress had ruled for all but 50 months.<ep>
   Rao, 74, inherited leadership after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was killed during the 1991 campaign.<ep>
   Critics say Rao failed to curb corruption, his economic reforms did not seep down to the rural poor, he lost control of party affairs and failed to inspire the public with his pedantic style. His indecisiveness is legendary.<ep>
   But Congress' downfall cannot be blamed on one man.<ep>
   Pran Chopra of the independent Center for Policy Research said Congress ``used to be suitable for India. It was an amorphous, undefined mass that appealed to all sectors. Indian society changed, but the Congress Party did not move on as quickly as it should have.''<ep>
   The party lost Muslim support when Rao failed to keep his promise to rebuild an ancient mosque destroyed in 1992 by Hindu radicals. Muslims make up 12 percent of India's 920 million people.<ep>
   More important, low-caste Hindus and the rural poor deserted Congress and formed their own parties. They saw Congress as a patronizing party of upper-caste Hindus who refused to share power.<ep>
   Their anger was intensified by economic reforms that largely ignored the villages and farms where 70 percent of all Indians live.<ep>
   By contrast, the BJP advocates tighter control of foreign investment, as well as nuclear armament and a reduction of special rights enjoyed by the Muslim minority.<ql>
