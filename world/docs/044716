<m1><ue5> <m0>BEIRUT <m0>(--) Israeli artillery fired on guerrillas attempting to infiltrate the Israeli-occupied border enclave in southern Lebanon on Saturday, security sources reported.<ep>
   There was no immediate word on casualties. It was not known to which group the infiltrators belonged, although the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah has spearheaded the guerrilla war to drive Israel from south Lebanon.<ep>
   It was the second time Israeli forces have been in action in the region since a U.S.-brokered cease-fire April 26 halted 16 days of Israeli air, naval and artillery bombardment that killed 164 people and wounded about 340.<ep>
   The agreement does not preclude guerrillas from attacking Israeli forces in the enclave or the Israelis from firing back, provided civilians and population centers are not targeted.<ql>

<m0> <m0>JERUSALEM <m0>(--) Prime Minister Shimon Peres has decided to postpone withdrawing troops from the West Bank city of Hebron until after Israel's May 29 elections, Israel radio said.<ep>
   The government does not want to risk increased friction between Jewish settlers and Palestinians in Hebron (--) the last West Bank city under Israeli occupation (--) in the sensitive period ahead of the vote, Foreign Minister Ehud Barak said.<ep>
   Hebron's Palestinian mayor, Mustafa Natche, reacted angrily to the government's apparent decision to retain control over his city for at least another month.<ep>
   ``This is killing the peace process. The Palestinians are being deceived,'' Natche said. ``This is the second time he [Peres] is postponing redeployment.''<ql>
