<m0>   DANNENBERG, Germany (--) (AP) (--) Riot police used truncheons, tear gas and water cannons Wednesday to break up a crowd of more than 3,000 anti-nuclear demonstrators blocking a truck loaded with atomic wastes.<ep>
   At least 10 officers and 20 protesters were injured, and at least 28 demonstrators were arrested in the skirmish in the northern town of Dannenberg.<ep>
   The protesters erected barricades of wood and bales of hay, and many flung rocks and bottles from slingshots at police who tried to break up their protest.<ep>
   Police in a helicopter fired warning shots from a starter pistol as 3,000 riot police, jogging in formation, ringed the truck and 60 escort vehicles to secure the convoy's passage.<ep>
   Slowed by the clashes, the convoy took six hours to make the 10-mile trip from the Dannenberg train station to a storage facility in Gorleben.<ep>
   The waste had arrived by train Wednesday morning from a reprocessing facility in France and was loaded onto a truck for transport to Gorleben.<ep>
   Germany has no reprocessing facilities of its own, and sent the waste to France for treatment with the understanding it would be returned for storage. Protesters have been demonstrating against the transport for weeks, at times sabotaging stretches of rail.<ep>
