<m0>   JERUSALEM (--) While most Israelis worry about the possibility of a pre-election suicide bomb, police see another threat: an attack by Jewish extremists on Prime Minister Shimon Peres.<ep>
   ``There's no doubt the possibility of a murder of the prime minister is a central influence on our deployment,'' said national police commander Assaf Hefetz.<ep>
   A right-wing religious Jew, Yigal Amir, assassinated the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin exactly six months ago Saturday. <ep>
   The assassination caused ``very sizable changes'' in Peres' security, Hefetz said.<ep>
   Peres often wears bulletproof vests, something Rabin refused. And with only a few exceptions, security guards prohibit him from walking among crowds.<ep>
   A state inquiry into the Rabin assassination found that the Shin Bet security forces ignored ample warnings that a Jewish militant might try to kill Rabin.<ep>
   Hefetz insisted security forces were not taking any threats lightly; Peres has said that intelligence has revealed hundreds of potential Jewish assailants. <ep>
