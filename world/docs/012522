<m0>   ZAGREB, Croatia (--) (AP) (--) A Croatian prosecutor has charged a satirical weekly with libeling President Franjo Tudjman under a new law that critics say is intended to muzzle his opponents.<ep>
   The criminal charge (--) the first test of the new libel law (--) comes amid a renewed government campaign against independent news outlets and individuals critical of the Croatian leader. Tudjman's governing party passed the law after he launched a sharp attack against his opponents in February.<ep>
   From the outset, critics of the law had feared that it would be used to crack down on Feral Tribune, a Split-based weekly whose irreverent pages government officials deplore as unpatriotic.<ep>
   Today, those fears were borne out: The prosecutor brought criminal libel charges against Viktor Ivancic, the weekly's editor-in-chief, and one of its writers, Marinko Culic. If convicted, they face up to three years in prison and fines.<ep>
   In last week's edition, Culic ridiculed Tudjman's proposal for reconciliation between World War II fascists and communists and compared him to the late Spanish dictator Gen. Francisco Franco, who promoted similar ideas.<ep>
   Both journalists denounced the charges and said police interrogated them over the weekend.<ep>
   ``This is a new campaign against independent media, the opposition, individuals critical of the government and all those whose opinions differ from the government's,'' Ivancic said.<ep>
   ``Too much power is concentrated in the hands of one man,'' he said. ``He may win the case in the courtroom, but he is certain to lose it when he loses power.''<ep>
   Tudjman faces re-election next year.<ql>
