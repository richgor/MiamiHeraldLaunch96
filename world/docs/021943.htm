   ROME -- The Northern League has risen from being a regional protest movement to a party that made, and then broke, a national government.<P>

   Now, it is sending shockwaves through the establishment with calls for northern Italy to secede and with the appearance of an ominous-looking green-shirted security force that evokes Italy's fascist past.<P>

   Mainstream political parties, the Roman Catholic Church and government officials all have protested since Northern League leader Umberto Bossi said Saturday that the north should become a separate nation.<P>

   The rhetoric at the rally in Mantua jumped up a notch from Bossi's usual agenda of more autonomy for Italy's regions. His talk touched a nerve across Italian society -- and so did the rally's green-shirted guards, whose presence recalled Fascist leader Benito Mussolini's black-shirted paramilitaries.<P>

   Mantua's prosecutor, Mario Luberto, is investigating whether Bossi can be charged with threatening the unity of the state, a crime under Italian law. And he said Tuesday that police are looking into whether the green-shirts serve ``a subversive function.''<P>

   Justice Minister Vincenzo Caianiello declared flat out Monday that ``secession is against the constitution.''<P>

   The idea also offends Italian World War II resistance veterans who fought against fascism. Bossi is ``giving life to a very dangerous game,'' one veteran wrote in the Turin daily La Stampa.<P>

   The Catholic Church, long holding itself out as a champion of national solidarity, also weighed in on the debate, with Rome Cardinal Camillo Ruini saying that dividing Italy would hurt ``the very economic interests of our peoples.''<P>

   But despite such formidable opposition, the League isn't backing down.<P>

   ``Secession means complete self-governing, either in a federal system, or out of it,'' said League parliament member Fiorello Provera. ``We, as the north, have a right to defend ourselves.''<P>

   Bossi brought the League to prominence in the early 1990s with a campaign against high taxes, bureaucracy, corruption and heavy state aid to the poorer, Mafia-ridden south.<P>

   The rumpled, gravel-voiced politician has turned provocation into a fine art. He has called for Italians to invest abroad and to withhold state television taxes. He has threatened to pull his legislators out of Parliament and set up a self-proclaimed ``parliament of the North'' in Mantua. He has baptized his potential state Padania, the geographical name for the Po River plain.<P>

   In 1994, the League joined with media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's conservative coalition, which won elections that year. But Berlusconi did little to appease the League's appetite for autonomy. Bossi pulled out of the coalition and caused the government to dissolve.<P>

   The League stayed independent in last month's national election, scoring up to 40 percent of the vote in some northern provinces for a surprisingly strong 10 percent showing overall.<P>

   Solid local organization has helped the League's popularity, as well as the deep vein of voter anger in the economically booming north, an area bursting with small businesses and export-producing companies. These League-supporters resent generating a lot of tax revenue, much of it drained away by Rome for the south, in exchange for so few public services.<P>

   ``Bossi is interpreting a very widespread state of mind,'' said Lucio Lami, editor of the pro-Northern League newspaper L'Indipendente. ``[He reflects] the revolt of the north against a bureaucratic state which doesn't solve problems and . . . spends tax money without reforms.''<P>

   In a recent survey by the SWG polling agency, 53 percent of League voters said they probably or certainly would follow Bossi down the path to secession.<P>

   At the very least, his rhetoric could push the victorious center-left coalition to give regions more autonomy over taxes, public spending and the justice system.<P>

   The real fear of the establishment is that northerners will stop paying taxes en masse, Provera said.
