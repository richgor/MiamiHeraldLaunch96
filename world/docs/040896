<m0>   PARIS (--) (AP) (--) Anti-terrorist police arrested 46 Algerians Friday, breaking open what they said was a major ring that channeled fake IDs to Muslim militants around Europe.<ep>
   Some 350 officers seized cash, arms and thousands of false documents they said would have enabled militants from Algeria, Germany and Italy to travel freely.<ep>
   Police said the sweeps in a Paris suburb and the southern port of Marseille demonstrated how entrenched militants have become in France, which last year suffered a series of bombings that killed eight people and wounded 160.<ep>
   Algerian Muslim militants claimed responsibility for some of the attacks. The militants are angry at France for its support of the government in its former North African colony.<ep>
   A four-year drive to overthrow Algeria's secularist rule and replace it with an Islamic government has claimed more than 40,000 lives. The Armed Islamic Group (--) the most violent of Algeria's factions (--) has repeatedly threatened to carry out attacks on French soil.<ep>
   On Thursday, French police arrested the alleged ringleader: Salem Nassah, 35, an Algerian-born junior high school physics instructor in the western suburb of Sartrouville.<ep>
   Police told the Paris daily Le Monde that Nassah was suspected of leading the false ID ring for at least a year. Many of the falsified documents were sold for up to $2,000 apiece, authorities said.<ep>
   The French government has arrested hundreds of Muslim suspects in scores of raids since last year's bombings.<ep>
   Most of the suspects have been released and never charged, sparking criticism that authorities are using the terrorist threat as a pretext to harass Muslims. <m2><ep>
