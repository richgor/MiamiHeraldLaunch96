<m0>   <m0>TEL AVIV <m0>(--) The U.S. Embassy said Friday that Americans traveling in the Middle East should take extra precautions following a federal court ruling allowing an Islamic leader to be extradited to Israel.<ep>

   A district court in New York ruled Wednesday that a Hamas leader, Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, can be extradited to Israel where he is accused of funding and ordering terror attacks. <ql>

<m0>   <m0>HAMBURG <m0>(--) An American neo-Nazi on trial for mailing banned anti-Semitic literature to fascists in Germany faces up to 14 years in prison, not five years as previously reported, the judge said Friday.<ep>
   Judge Guenter Bertram made a point of correcting the error on the second day of Gary Lauck's trial on charges of inciting hatred and distributing illegal anti-Semitic literature.<ep>
   The rest of the day was spent reading aloud from the material Lauck published in Lincoln, Neb. Lauck mailed the hate literature to Germany for two decades, until he was arrested last year at a neo-Nazi convention in Denmark, where he was no longer protected by U.S. free-speech guarantees.<ql>
