   NAIROBI, Kenya (--) After more than 30 years of being threatened, chased, slapped, thrown, punched, kicked, choked, whipped and stepped on by her husband, Agnes summoned the strength last winter to take an unusual step for an abused African wife.<ep>
   She left.<ep>
   More unusual is that she found solace in a home in Nairobi that serves battered women. It is the first such shelter in Kenya, where spousal abuse (--) as in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa (--) is a not-so-hidden shame.<ep>
   From Sudan to South Africa, from Mali to Mozambique, spousal abuse is among sub-Saharan Africa's best-known and least-discussed secrets, a problem far more pervasive but much less addressed than other social ills, such as AIDS.<ep>
   Over the centuries in most African societies, battering one's wife has become both a right and a rite. In some ethnic groups, social workers say, if a man's wife dies before he has assaulted her, he must prove his manhood by beating her corpse. In addition, economic dependence on men, cynical police officers and judges, and even scorn from other women, have long forced abused wives to silently swallow their pain.<ep>
<m1>Taboo subject<ep>
<m0>   Perhaps most powerful is the African notion that the family is a bastion of privacy, in which unpleasant matters especially must be shielded from public scrutiny.<ep>
   ``The biggest problem is that nobody wants to talk about it,'' said Anne Ngugi, director of the Women's Rights Awareness Program, or Wrap, which opened the home for battered women in which Agnes found solace. ``It comes down to people feeling that it [violence against women] is part of African tradition, and so people must keep quiet.''<ep>
   A recent survey taken by Ngugi's organization in Kenya revealed a high awareness of violence against women, but little resolve to tackle the problem.<ep>
   More than 70 percent of those surveyed (--) both men and women (--) said they knew that wife beating occurred in their neighborhood. Yet nearly 60 percent of respondents said women were always or sometimes responsible for the beatings they suffered. About 51 percent said that men who batter women should not be punished.<ep>
   Battered wives thus rarely go to the police. Asked how women who are being beaten should respond, only 3 percent of those surveyed by Wrap said that the victim should seek help from law enforcement authorities. In rare cases that make it through Kenya's justice system, assailants typically receive a small fine.<ep>
   During her three decades as a battered wife, Agnes (--) who is now 60 and asked not to be fully identified (--) never called the police. She did not tell co-workers. She did not tell friends.<ep>
   ``The police would have taken a bribe from my husband, and then they would have left, and he would have beaten me again,'' said the former teacher, a stout woman with a round, wrinkle-free face and a charming smile.<ep>
<m1>`I was so scared'<ep>
<m0>   She did not tell those closest to her because ``I was so scared, and I was feeling so embarrassed. I did not want people to know about it.''<ep>
   Agnes, whose husband was also a teacher, said the violence began a few years after she got married, when she caught her husband in bed with a teenage girl.<ep>
   He began to beat her every evening. He forced her to give him her paycheck. He called her his slave. For about two years, the violence eased, but alcoholic rages and financial irresponsibility again became the norm. And the beatings got worse.<ep>
   In one typical fight, she said, he chased her around their small house in north-central Kenya. When he caught her, he stomped, kicked and punched her.<ep>
   Activists say it is not unusual for African women to stay in such situations for decades. In most African homes, women are generally less educated than their husbands and often do not have professional skills, leaving them economically bound to the men.<ep>
   ``A lot of these women try to protect the marriage because marriage gives you high status,'' said Lucy Njeri Karuru, Kenyan coordinator for Women and Law in East Africa, a research group with offices here, in Tanzania and in Uganda. ``And if they divorce, society, including their women friends, will not look upon that favorably.''<ep>
   Janet Kabeberi-Macharia, regional coordinator for the research group, said part of the problem is that spousal abuse falls under the general category of ``physical assault'' in Kenya.<ep>
   ``Most men do not see beating their wives as a crime,'' she said. ``A more specific law would help to let people know that this specific act is wrong. As it stands now, a lot of men (--) and women (--) think that beating your wife is something you do if you really care about her.''<ep>
