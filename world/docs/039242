<m0>  ROME (--) (AP) (--) An Italian prosecutor began his case against a former SS captain Friday by saying that Nazism is not on trial, but a specific event: the massacre of 335 civilians during Germany's occupation of Rome.<ep>
   Erich Priebke, 82, is charged with participating in the 1944 slayings, which were in retaliation for a bomb attack that killed 32 German soldiers.<ep>
   He is likely to be one of the last senior Nazi officers to face judgment in court, given the half-century that has passed since the end of World War II.<ep>
   ``This is a trial to reconfirm certain principles of law and of humanity that were violated with brutality,'' prosecutor Antonino Intelisano said.<ep>
   Also on trial, he said, is ``the memory of a history that cannot be forgotten.''<ep>
   ``The retaliation, decided by the Nazi command, was, in reality, a collective sanction against the Italian population.''<ep>
   The victims of the massacre at the Ardeatine Caves outside Rome included Roman Catholic priests, a 14-year-old boy and 75 Jews.<ep>
   Wearing the same blue-gray suit he wore on opening day Wednesday, Priebke occasionally took notes while Intelisano addressed the military court.<ep>
   Priebke admits to killing two victims and calling out the names of 100 others who were led to the caves, gunned down and then dynamited in an attempt to hide the bodies.<ep>
   But he insists he would have faced death if he had not followed orders.<ep>
   He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.<ep>
  Priebke lived for decades in Argentina before his background was revealed and he was extradited last year to Italy.<ep>
