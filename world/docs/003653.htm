   BORLANGE, Sweden -- When Lennart and Birgitta Berglund imagine those horrible last moments in the raging Baltic Sea, they like to think Birgitta's parents met death's cold advance in the warmth of each other's arms.<P>

   Maybe the vacationing couple stayed behind in their cabin as the crippled ferry Estonia flipped on its side and was sucked from the horizon. And maybe they are still there -- locked in their final embrace 250 feet beneath the sea.<P>

   ``But we are realistic,'' Lennart Berglund said. ``This was a catastrophe, and they probably got separated. We can accept that if it is true. But we need to clear this up once and for all.''<P>

   The Berglunds are among the hundreds of families from 24 countries who lost loved ones aboard the Estonia, an ocean-liner-sized passenger and car ferry that sailed the popular nine-hour party run between Estonia and Sweden. The ship sank off the coast of Finland in September 1994 amid heavy seas, killing 852 people in Europe's worst peacetime disaster at sea this century.<P>

   The Berglunds are also the leaders of a determined group of relatives, many from this central Swedish steel town that was home to 50 of the dead, who are angered and troubled by an elaborate government effort to forever cut them off from the wreckage. If the government doesn't back down, the Berglunds say, they have arranged to raid the site and seize Birgitta's parents.<P>

   ``It is not the bodies themselves that are so important. It is that you have done what is expected of you as a human being,'' Lennart Berglund said. ``You are supposed to put a family member to rest, whether it takes one year or 50.''<P>

A concrete tomb<BR>
   On the order of Swedish authorities, 25,000 tons of gravel are being deposited around the sunken vessel as the foundation for a gigantic 12-inch-thick concrete sarcophagus. The $45 million project is to encase the ferry -- and its hundreds of entombed passengers -- in an impenetrable underwater mausoleum by summer's end.<P>

   The Swedish government, bankroller of the effort, says the structure will provide a fitting memorial to the 519 Swedes and 333 others who perished, while also keeping out plunderers and adventurers already drawn by the notoriety of the site and its possible great riches.<P>

   A salvage effort, officials say, has been ruled out as too perilous and too gruesome, although government investigators have examined the wreckage closely enough to report that about 300 of an estimated 700 to 800 trapped bodies are within reach. The ferry, nearly upside-down, is lodged on a sloping seabed about 60 miles off southwest Finland.<P>

   ``There is a maritime tradition when it comes to people lost at sea,'' said Anders Iacobaeus, head of legal affairs for the Swedish Ministry of Transport and Communications, which has responsibility for the Estonia. ``The sea is a burial ground. You don't go down and disturb bodies.''<P>

Desperate measures<P>

   But in a race against the clock, desperate relatives are pressing the government to halt construction of the massive sarcophagus, while rushing to hire ships for a possible last-ditch effort to recover corpses themselves.<P>

   In Sweden, Finland and nearby Estonia, such free-lance expeditions are punishable by two years in jail, but defiant family members are looking to ships from neighboring countries to skirt the national prohibitions.<P>

   Emotions are running so high that some family members have threatened to lay mines near the wreckage to prevent continued work, while others have waged street demonstrations, most recently in Tallinn, the Estonian capital.<P>

   The Finnish coast guard is monitoring the wreckage with radar, and its ships patrol the area to dissuade anyone from approaching.<P>

   A Swedish accident investigator said that patrols cannot block people from outside Sweden, Finland and Estonia from exploring the site but that they can make such visits as unpleasant as possible.<P>

   ``You send out ships that make waves while at the same time you put diplomatic pressure on the countries where the divers come from,'' said Olof Forssberg, director general of the Swedish Board of Accident Investigation. ``I think everything would be done to keep people away.''<P>

   But Peter Barasinski, a Polish-born Swedish citizen who has already made one unsuccessful effort to retrieve the body of his wife, Carita, said nothing will stop him from repeatedly trying.<P>

   Barasinski met his wife seven years ago when they worked as crew members on another Baltic ferry. The couple often sailed and went scuba diving together, and though they never talked of dying on a ferry, they did broach the subject of a scuba accident.<P>

   ``We promised that if one of us were to drown, the other would take the body up to the surface,'' said a glassy-eyed Barasinski, his wife peering over his shoulder from a large photograph in his Stockholm apartment. ``I've talked to two survivors who saw her for the last time. I know where she is. After the Vietnam War, families wanted to bring home the bodies of soldiers they could find. It is no different for me.''<P>

   Despite growing pressure from families and an expanding corps of international lawyers, Swedish government officials have so far not budged on the issue. Newly appointed Prime Minister Goran Persson hinted last month that the decision was open for discussion, but he later backed off when Transport Minister Ines Uusmann corrected him.<P>

   In March, a Swedish court ruled that there were no legal grounds to overrule the government, and officials with Nordic Marine Contractors, the consortium commissioned to cover the Estonia, said they would move forward without delay.<P>

   ``I understand the desire of people who wanted to recover bodies during the first months after the accident,'' said Iacobaeus, a top aide to Uusmann. ``But those who want to do it now -- I find it, well, sick. You have to let bygones be bygones.''
