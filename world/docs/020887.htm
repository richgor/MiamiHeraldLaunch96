   WASHINGTON -- Iranian arms were flowing to Bosnia even before the United States gave tacit approval to shipments through Croatia, White House national security adviser Anthony Lake said Friday.<P>

   ``We believe it was very, very important <BR>
that Bosnia be able to defend itself better,'' Lake said in a speech to the American Jewish Committee.<P>

   Another administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that by the summer of 1994 congressional leaders knew of the Iranian arms shipments. At the time, a United Nations embargo was in effect barring arms shipments to any of the factions in the Balkans conflict.<P>

   But the official conceded that the members of Congress were not told that in April 1994 the administration gave its tacit assent to the deliveries.<P>

   ``Nobody asked the question when they were in the presence of either Lake or the president: `Are we doing anything to facilitate the flow of these weapons?' '' he said.<P>

   Members of Congress argue that the administration misled them.<P>

    The administration official, who declined to be identified, said the Iranian arms flow began as early as 1992 and involved mostly small arms. He said the Turkish government cooperated in the shipments.<P>

   Lake said in his speech that when Croatia asked the administration in 1994 whether it should allow arms shipments to pass through its territory to Bosnia, ``It was at a time in which Bosnia was under terrible assault and it looked as if it might fall apart or even go under.''<P>

   ``We knew that meant Iranian arms, because in fact, Iranian arms were already going through in some measure,'' Lake said. <P>

   Several committees of Congress are questioning the decision to allow the arms to flow through Croatia. Republicans contend the decision gave Iran a foothold in Bosnia.<P>

    ``A conscious policy to deceive the Congress,'' said Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., a member of the select subcommittee established by the House to investigate the arms transaction.<P>

   The White House adviser said the request came shortly after the administration succeeded in persuading Croatia and Bosnia to form a federation to strengthen their position against the Bosnian Serbs. <P>

   He said that if the administration had said no to Croatia ``and succeeded perhaps in convincing Croatia not to let those arms through, it would have blown the federation apart -- and the federation was the strategic basis for everything that has been accomplished since.''
