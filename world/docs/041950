<m0>   <m0>CAPE TOWN<m0> (--) President Nelson Mandela's government postponed local elections in the troubled Zulu kingdom on Monday, citing political violence there.<ep>
   The postponement means voting for town and rural councils in KwaZulu-Natal province will take place no later than June 30, instead of on May 29 as planned. A specific date has not been set.<ep>
   In a unanimous decision reached in a 5 1/2-hour meeting, Mandela's Cabinet sided with his African National Congress in putting off the voting in hopes of improving security in the violence-wracked province.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>GROZNY<m0> (--) A top Chechen rebel commander said Monday he is ready to talk with the Russians on military matters but not about the political question of resolving the conflict in the breakaway republic.<ep>
   Aslan Maskhadov, the separatists' military chief-of-staff, said he is ready to discuss prisoner-of-war exchanges, security guarantees for Russian troops being withdrawn from Chechnya and the establishment of cease-fire zones inside Chechnya.<ep>
   Last summer, Maskhadov conducted talks that helped lead to a cease-fire. Although the accord did not hold, Maskhadov impressed the Russian commanders as someone with whom they could negotiate.<ql>
