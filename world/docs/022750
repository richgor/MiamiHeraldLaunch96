<m0>   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (--) (AP) (--) A Bosnian Serb bar owner accused of murder and torture in a reign of terror at Serb prison camps went on trial Tuesday in the first international war crimes trial since Nuremberg.<ep>
   The prosecution accused Dusan Tadic of killing more than 30 Muslims and Croats and torturing more than a dozen female inmates in and around the camps. Tadic's defense attorney called him an innocent victim of mistaken identity, and a scapegoat for an international community hungry for revenge.<ep>
   Looking pale and drawn after 14 months in custody, Tadic, 40, sat impassively in the prisoner's dock, flanked by two U.N. guards and listening to a translation of the proceedings over a headset. He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted.<ep>
   ``Through this trial we will embark on an examination of offenses of unspeakable horror,'' the chief prosecutor, Grant Niemann of Australia, said in a statement detailing Tadic's alleged crimes.<ep>

WAR CRIMES,  FROM  1A<ql>
<m0>Tadic, who prosecutors say killed and tortured Muslims in and around the Serb-run Omarska prison camp in northwestern Bosnia in 1992.<ep>
   Tadic allegedly acted as a roving thug at three camps in Bosnia's northwestern Prijedor region from May through December 1992. He also <m4>McDonald<m2><ql>
<m0>is accused of rounding up Muslims and Croats in the region, killing or assaulting some, and driving others into the camps.<ep>
   In one incident, Tadic allegedly forced a prisoner to castrate another using his teeth.<ep>
   Niemann also accused Tadic of participating in gang rapes and described one incident in which the defendant, a martial arts expert, allegedly helped to beat prisoners to death with karate kicks.<ep>
   Prosecutors will provide witnesses who claim to have survived beatings by Tadic. Some witnesses are so terrified of the defendant that they will be allowed to testify from outside the courtroom via a video link.<ep>
   Defense lawyer Mischa Wladimiroff described the Yugoslav tribunal as an experiment in justice that could fail.<ep>
   ``An international hunger for a verdict of guilty must be resisted at all costs,'' Wladimiroff said. ``The tribunal must be wary of desires for revenge and the need for a scapegoat.''<ql>
<m0>Defense claims<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The court-appointed lawyer said he would call witnesses to show Tadic was in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka when the atrocities were committed. He also plans to call character witnesses and survivors of detention camps to deny Tadic's involvement in crimes he is accused of committing there.<ep>
   Tadic originally also had been charged with rape, but in the opening minutes of the trial, the court dropped that charge at the request of prosecutors, who said the victim was too frightened to testify.<ep>
   Security was extremely tight. To enter the public gallery, spectators had to go through metal detectors and place their bags and other packages on an X-ray machine.<ep>
   Four U.N. guards were inside the courtroom, and about a dozen guards patrolled the lobby downstairs and the public gallery.<ep>
   Court proceedings are relayed to spectators via television monitors in the public gallery, the lobby and two red press tents set up on the lawn outside the tribunal headquarters.<ql>
<m0>150 witnesses<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of Texas and two colleagues will rule on the case, which is expected to last up to four months and hear as many as 150 witnesses.<ep>
   ``This trial has certain historic dimensions,'' McDonald told the court. ``Nevertheless, we should all remember first and foremost that this is a criminal trial of an accused who . . . pleaded not guilty. He is entitled to a fair trial and to ensure he receives one is our paramount purpose for being here.''<ep>
   After World War II, the Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes courts became the first to recognize crimes against humanity. But in the half-century since, those laws have never been tested in an international forum.<ep>
   If Tadic is found guilty of the other crimes, the tribunal's maximum sentence would be life imprisonment (--) unlike the post-World War II military courts at Nuremberg and Tokyo, which sent 17 Axis war criminals to the gallows.<ep>
   The U.N. court has indicted 57 suspects, among them Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, but the highest-profile suspects have not been arrested.<ep>
