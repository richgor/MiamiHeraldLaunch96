<m0>   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (--) (AP) (--) Cheering delegates leaped to their feet to dance and sing Wednesday, as South Africa took another step from apartheid to democracy by adopting a constitution that guarantees equal rights for blacks and whites.<ep>
   But the euphoria of the document's authors was tarnished by boycotts and abstentions by Zulu and Afrikaner nationalists, and threatened court challenges by the country's last apartheid rulers.<ep>
   The white-led National Party also hinted it might pull out of Nelson Mandela's unity government, a prospect that caused the rand to drop 12 cents against the U.S. dollar.<ep>
   After two years of acrimonious debate, the Constitutional Assembly that drafted the 150-page document voted 421-2 with 10 abstentions Wednesday to pass it. At the vote, delegates celebrated in the parliament chamber, where apartheid laws once were passed.<ep>
   African National Congress leaders called the constitution a birth certificate for democracy in South Africa.<ep>
   ``It is a firm assertion made by ourselves that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white,'' said Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.<ep>
   However, Zulu nationalists boycotted Wednesday's historic vote and Afrikaner nationalists abstained. More extremist whites rejected the document, and the National Party and others threatened court challenges to some provisions.<ep>
   Such developments dampened what was otherwise a day of victory for Mandela's ANC party two years after winning the nation's first all-race election.<ep>
   ``Never and never again shall the laws of our land rend our people apart or legalize their oppression and repression,'' Mandela said in a celebratory speech. ``I would like everybody to think in terms of their country as a whole, black and white.''<ep>
   The constitution will take effect gradually over the next three years, then come into force fully with the next national elections in 1999. It still must be certified by the Constitutional Court, which operates like the U.S. Supreme Court in interpreting the constitution.<ep>
   The document calls for a majority-rule government, with a party that wins more than half the seats in Parliament having the power to choose a president, who would form the Cabinet. The current system required Mandela to give Cabinet jobs to parties that received at least 10 percent of the vote in the 1994 election.<ep>
   A bill of rights guarantees the right to adequate housing, food, water, education and health care (--) all of which were denied the black majority during the apartheid era. It also bans discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, pregnancy or marital status.<ep>
   Despite the overwhelming support, parties that joined the ANC in backing the new constitution expressed reservations that it gave too much power to the governing party.<ep>
   Deputy President F.W. de Klerk, the National Party leader and last apartheid president, called the lack of guaranteed powers for minority parties a major problem.<ep>
   ``We have placed the positives and the negatives on the scale and we have decided the positives outweigh the negatives and that is why . . . we are voting in favor of this constitution,'' de Klerk said.<ep>
