   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (--) Dressed up for a night on the town, Alena Gronzikova and three friends arrived at the Music Park disco only to be turned away by the doorman. That same evening, the group tried a half-dozen other Prague clubs but were rebuffed each time.<ep>
    The reason? Gronzikova and her friends are Romany, or Gypsies.<ep>
    ``It's a terrible feeling when they won't let you in just because you have different color skin,'' says 25-year-old Gronzikova. ``It's the same as if they didn't allow in people who don't have legs, or who are somehow handicapped, or bald people. A person feels degraded.''<ep>
    While the Czech Republic surges ahead of its former communist neighbors (--) the country is widely recognized as having the most dynamic economy in the region (--) the nation faces at least one nagging problem: relations between ethnic Czechs and the substantial population of Romany.<ep>
<m1>Widespread discrimination<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>    Last year, the independent Citizens' Solidarity and Tolerance Movement recorded more than 80 race-motivated attacks on Romany, including one in which skinheads clubbed a father of five to death with a baseball bat while his wife and children looked on helplessly.<ep>
    In the town of Breclav, a hotel owned by parliamentary candidate Rudolf Baranek posted a sign banning Romany from the premises. While Baranek was reprimanded, he remains a candidate for this month's elections.<ep>
    A poll last November found that 69 percent of Czechs have ill feelings toward Romany and only 5 percent feel relations are good. Out of eight ethnic groups covered in the survey (--) including Jews, Slovaks and citizens of the former Soviet Union (--) attitudes toward Romany were by far the most negative.<ep>
    ``You feel inferior. You're a person, but only when you have an obligation,'' says Marta Tulejova, an activist with the Citizens' Solidarity and Tolerance Movement. ``When it comes to rights, you cease being a person, and you become a Gypsy.''<ep>
<m1>Capitalism hurts Romany<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>     Many Romany say their lot has actually gotten worse since the Velvet Revolution that brought down communism in Czechoslovakia six years ago. While life for Romany was far from easy before 1989, during the communist era they were generally guaranteed at least basic housing and employment.<ep>
    Now, with the market economy in full force, many Romany have difficulty securing either. Unemployment among Romany men stands between 30 and 50 percent (--) more than 10 times the national average. And the unskilled jobs they once held are being filled by workers from countries farther east, such as Ukraine, Russia, Poland and Bulgaria.<ep>
    ``For the lowest social group, <m1> <m0>Romany, the only certainty was the shovel (--) they could find work digging ditches,'' says Emil Scuka, head of the Romany Civic Initiative, a political party with no current representation in Parliament. ``Now the Ukrainians have taken away the shovel, and the Romany are left with the street (--) criminality, prostitution.''<ep>
    If many Romany are criminals (--) and statistics and anecdotal evidence indicate that is the case (--) activists in the community say the general economic straits of Romany are to blame.<ep>
<m1>Cries for education reform<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>    The root of the community's problems, virtually everyone agrees, is education. Without better schooling, it seems unlikely the Romany will ever get better jobs and emerge from their current status as second-class citizens. <ep>
    Improving Romany education, however, will not be easy. Since many Romany do not speak Czech at home, they start school at a disadvantage to ethnic Czechs. Rather than giving such students remedial Czech, teachers simply ship them off to schools for mentally handicapped children, despite a lack of any evidence of any learning disabilities.<ep>
    The government, meanwhile, defends its record on Romany issues. While acknowledging that racism exists in the Czech Republic, Hana Fristenska, director of the government's Council for Nationalities, notes that lawmakers have toughened penalties for racial attacks and police now follow extremist groups more closely. <ep>

<m2><ql>
<m0>   In addition, some schools are offering a ``zero year'' during which young Romany will be able to improve their Czech language skills before entering first grade, while others are hiring teaching assistants who speak both Czech and Romany.<ep>
     ``Racism and discrimination are among the most difficult problems a society faces,'' Fristenska says. ``The government is doing what is currently possible.''<ep>
    But Romany activists say the government needs to make a more concerted effort to address the problems faced by their community. Without stronger measures (--) including tighter controls on discrimination, an end to placing Romany children in schools for mentally handicapped, and possibly even affirmative action (--) they say the community will fall farther and farther behind ethnic Czechs.<ep>
    ``The state is doing very little, and they should do more, a lot more,'' says Scuka. ``The worst is that both sides are starting to get used to the racism that is here. Romany are starting to get a sort of immunity to it, and the Czechs simply think this is the way things are supposed to be.''<ep>
