<m0>   <m0>THE HAGUE<m0> (--) The first Muslim taken into custody by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal pleaded not guilty Thursday to murders, rapes and torture allegedly committed against Serb inmates at a prison camp he commanded.<ep>
   Zejnil Delalic, 48, was handed over to the tribunal Wednesday by German authorities who arrested him in March on tribunal orders. He was brought Thursday before the same three-judge panel hearing the first war crimes trial of the Bosnian war, which opened this week.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>HAMBURG<m0> (--) An American neo-Nazi refused Thursday to testify at his trial for sending banned anti-Semitic material to fascists in Germany, saying the charges were illegal.<ep>
   Gary Lauck mailed the hate literature from his Nebraska base for two decades, until he was arrested last year at a neo-Nazi convention in Denmark, where he was no longer protected by U.S. free-speech guarantees.<ep>
   Lauck, who turns 43 on Sunday, is accused of being the German fascists' main supplier of anti-Semitic brochures, films and other propaganda. Such material is illegal in Germany. If convicted, Lauck faces a maximum of five years in prison.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>MANAMA<m0> (--) A state security court has sentenced 11 opposition activists to prison terms of one to five years for an arson attack on a restaurant, according to newspaper reports Thursday.<ep>
   No one was injured when Robert's restaurant, which was popular with Westerners, was torched March 13. A violent Shiite Muslim-led opposition campaign is demanding political reform.<ep>
   The official Gulf News Agency, meanwhile, said a gas leak, not explosives, caused a blast Tuesday that demolished a house in a Shiite village, killing a couple and their 3-year-old son. <ep>
