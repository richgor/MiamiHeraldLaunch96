   HONG KONG (--) Thousands of Vietnamese desperate to avoid being sent home battled with police and set huts and cars ablaze Friday during a mass breakout from a Hong Kong detention camp.<ep>
   Rioting began to sweep the Whitehead Detention Center in northern Hong Kong before dawn and eventually grew to involve about 3,000 of the 8,000 refugees, prisons spokesman Leonel Rodrigues said.<ep>
   About 140 refugees toppled fences at the camp, which is ringed by barbed wire, and escaped onto a beach. Many vanished into the hilly terrain in the New Territories, Hong Kong's mainland, with about 70 reported still at large early today.<ep>
   Forty-three prison officers, police and firefighters suffered minor injuries, and six Vietnamese needed hospital treatment, the government said.<ep>
   The violence was triggered by government plans to move 1,100 camp dwellers to another lockup to await deportation.<ep>
   Asian countries have been stepping up efforts to deport more than 30,000 Vietnamese still left in their camps. For Hong Kong, the task is particularly pressing because it wants to close its camps before the British colony reverts to Chinese rule next year.<ep>
   The Vietnamese, many of whom arrived on rickety boats in the 1980s, say they fear persecution at home. They have often rioted against efforts to deport them. There have been three breakouts in the past year in Hong Kong, but all but one of the 123 escapees have been recaptured.<ep>
   Hong Kong says the Vietnamese are job-seekers, not political refugees, and government leaders said Friday they would push ahead with the repatriation.<ep>
   That enflamed the refugees and prompted the breakout.<ep>
   ``Men, women and children were running along the beach. They were carrying bags,'' said a woman who lives in To Tau village behind the camp.<ep>
   At the same time, other refugees set 26 huts and 53 vehicles ablaze during clashes with prison officers and police who fired about 1,800 rounds of tear gas, a government statement said.<ep>
   The area around the main gate was ``foot-deep in rocks and stones. The whole camp was on fire,'' police officer Jim Gray said.<ep>
   Palls of smoke rose above the camp, and helicopters water-bombed the flames. Police roadblocks around the camp snarled traffic, and officers ran after escapees on village streets.<ep>
   Vietnamese inside the camp took 15 prison officers captive and released them after four hours, a government statement said.<ep>
   Four hundred Vietnamese continued their protest Friday night by sitting on dormitory roofs in a section of the camp, police said.<ep>
   Government statements initially spoke of ``about 200 armed Vietnamese migrants'' breaking out, and urged people to lock their doors.<ep>
   But 16 hours later, as captives trickled back, many turned out to be women and children. A frightened-looking boy and a weeping woman were led in on foot. A truck brought two dozen women and children. Men in another truck raised cuffed hands in a victory gesture.<ep>
   With no friends or money, unable to speak Chinese and with the nearby Chinese border sealed, it would be difficult for the Vietnamese to stay at large for long.<ep>
   ``They stand out like sore thumbs,'' police officer Charles Mitchell said.<ep>
