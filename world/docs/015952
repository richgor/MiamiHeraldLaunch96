   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (--) South Africa adopted a new Constitution on Wednesday, officially and peacefully completing the country's transition from centuries of white supremacy to a nonracial democracy.<ep>
   In the austere parliamentary chamber where many of apartheid's laws were created, the Constitutional Assembly embraced a document that renounces the racism of the past and guarantees all South Africans broad freedoms of speech, movement and political activity.<ep>
   The 140-page document, which will take effect gradually over three years, establishes a federal system with a strong presidency and a two-chamber legislature. It also includes a bill of rights that is one of the broadest in the world.<ep>
   Besides barring discrimination on the basis of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, pregnancy and marital status, it also includes, in an inscription of often unmet hopes, the right to housing, health care, water, food and education.<ep>
   It creates a strong central government, certain to be dominated for now by Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, which garnered more than 60 percent of the vote in the last election. Supporters of the largely white Nationalist Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party of Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi had called for greater provincial autonomy.<ep>
   Buthelezi's supporters, Zulu nationalists who are engaged in an often-violent struggle with the ANC for control over the province of KwaZulu/Natal, marched out of the constitutional negotiations months ago, and were absent from the proceedings Wednesday.<ep>
   Before voting Wednesday, leaders of the two major white political parties, which control about 25 percent of seats in the Parliament, took to the podium to speak out against aspects of the document such as the lack of guarantees that minority parties will have places in the Cabinet, and an apparent ban on capital punishment.<ep>
   But when the votes were counted, the new Constitution, which took nearly two years to draft, had been adopted by a margin of 421-2. There were 10 abstentions.<ep>
   ``And so it has come to pass that South Africa today undergoes her rebirth, cleansed of a horrible past, matured from a tentative beginning, and reaching out to the future with confidence,'' Mandela said.<ep>
   ``Our pledge is: Never and never again shall the laws of our land rend our people apart or legalize their oppression and repression.''<ep>
    Mandela acknowledged the complaints of the minority parties and promised that his government would keep trying to address their concerns. And he cautioned all South Africans (--) black and white (--) to rise above ethnic loyalties.<ep>
   ``If you talk to whites, they think only whites exist and they look at the problems from the point of view of whites,'' Mandela said.<ep>
   ``They forget also that blacks exist. But we have another problem. If you talk to blacks, coloreds and Indians, they make the same mistake. They think whites do not exist. They are triumphant. They think they are dealing with a community that is lying prostrate on the ground begging for mercy. Both tendencies are wrong.''<ep>
