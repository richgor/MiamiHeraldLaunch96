<m0>   <m0>GROZNY<m0> (--) Russian troops captured the separatist stronghold of Goiskoye in southern Chechnya on Tuesday, and reportedly hit one of the republic's largest towns with artillery and air attacks.<ep>
   The commander of Russian army units in the breakaway republic, Vladimir Shamanov, said some rebels in Goiskoye were ``eliminated'' and some left the village, which has been under Russian siege for weeks.<ep>
   He said the rebels lost three armored personnel carriers, two artillery pieces and three anti-aircraft guns in the Russian attack, Itar-Tass news agency reported.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>ALGIERS<m0> (--) Police stormed a housing project Tuesday to end a three-day hostage-taking by Islamic militants. Authorities said 18 people were killed, including a hostage and a police officer.<ep>
   Police made the last of several assaults on the six-story building at dawn Tuesday, after militants seized an undetermined number of residents on Sunday.<ep>
   Only three of the 16 hostage-takers were still alive at the time of the last assault, officials said. The rest died in earlier police offensives.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>LAGOS<m0> (--) Cameroon is continuing to bombard Nigerian positions along a disputed stretch of oil-rich land, Nigeria's military government said Tuesday.<ep>
   A military spokesman said 13 Nigerian soldiers were wounded in an ambush by Cameroonian border guards Sunday in the Bakassi Peninsula claimed by both countries. Each government has accused the other's troops of renewing the firefights last week.<ep>
   The peninsula sits in the Gulf of Guinea and straddles the borders of the two West African countries, which almost went to war over it in 1981.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>LUKAVAC<m0> (--) Two U.S. soldiers in the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia were seriously injured early Tuesday when gasoline-fueled kitchen stoves exploded, the Army said.<ep>
   The series of about 15 explosions apparently started when a cooking stove exploded while being turned on to prepare breakfast, setting off a chain reaction that included small arms fire.<ep>
   Pfc. Tiffany N. Frazier, 21, of Detroit, received serious burns to the face, hands and arms, and Sgt. First Class Curtis Wilson, 35, from Farnhamville, Iowa, was burned on the arms and legs.<ep>
