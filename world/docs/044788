<m0>   MADRID (--) Dominguin, the famed bullfighter profiled by Ernest Hemingway and romantically linked with actress Ava Gardner, died Wednesday at his home in southern Spain. He was 69.<ep>
   Dominguin, whose real name was Luis Miguel Gonzalez Lucas, suffered a stroke at his farm near Andujar, said Fernando Fernandez Roman, a bull<m4>Dominguin<m2><ql>
<m0>fighting critic who spoke with Dominguin's family after the death. He had been suffering from stomach cancer.<ep>
   In his book <m0>The Dangerous Summer,<m0> Hemingway chronicled the intense rivalry during the summer of 1959 between Dominguin and bullfighter Antonio Ordon~ez.<ep>
   ``Bullfighting is worthless without rivalry. But with two great bullfighters, it becomes a deadly rivalry,'' Hemingway wrote, explaining that the constant one-upmanship can force one bullfighter to go beyond his abilities and become wounded or killed.<ep>
   That dangerous summer ended with Dominguin being gored. ``The bull paid no attention to the cape and sank his horn into Luis Miguel's thigh,'' Hemingway wrote.<ep>
   Upon hearing of Dominguin's death, Ordon~ez immediately left his office in Seville for his old rival's home to pay his respects, the news agency EFE reported.<ep>
   Dominguin's steely nerves and dark, lean looks sparked the amorous attentions of film actresses, including Gardner with whom he was romantically linked from 1953 to 1956.<ep>
   The son of a famous bullfighter, Dominguin began his bullfighting career at age 11 in Lisbon. His last bullfight was in Barcelona on Sept. 12, 1973.<ep>
   Dominguin's son Miguel Bose is a singer and film actor. Dominguin is also survived by two daughters, Paola Dominguin and Lucia Dominguin.<ep>
