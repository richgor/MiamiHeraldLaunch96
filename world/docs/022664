<m0>   PARIS (--) Angered at taking the heat for child pornography on the Internet, France's top Internet providers have staged a cyberspace sit-in, blocking access to a portion of the global communications network in protest.<ep>
   Their grievance is gaining international attention as the world wrestles with the murky legal question of who is responsible for the pornography that makes up a small portion of traffic on the global computer network.<ep>
   At issue is whether a company can be held liable for merely providing access to places where other people post illegal images.<ep>
   ``It's an uncharted area of the law, both in the United States and abroad,'' said Shari Steele, an attorney for the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, which champions civil liberties in cyberspace.<ep>
   The conflict started Monday when national police, as part of a larger crackdown on child pornography, raided the Paris headquarters of FranceNet and WorldNet. It shut them down and briefly jailed their top executives, FranceNet's Rafi Haladjian and WorldNet's Sebastien Socchard.<ep>
   The pair face up to three years in prison and $100,000 fines for charges in connection with carrying pornographic images of boys and girls.<ep>
   The images appeared on Usenet, an Internet network of some 8,000 newsgroups that provides an international forum for topics from sports to politics. A small number of newsgroups are devoted to sexual topics. Most Usenet postings come from Canada and the United States.<ep>
   WorldNet and FranceNet, among about a half-dozen French companies that give customers access to the Internet, call the charges a classic case of shooting the messenger.<ep>
   ``We're just the operators (--) like France Telecom, which puts its telephone lines in the hands of its clients,'' Socchard told the Paris daily Le Figaro after his release from jail.<ep>
   In solidarity, France's other Internet providers agreed Wednesday to cut their customers' access to Usenet for a week. Customers can still send and receive e-mail on and access other parts of the Internet.<ep>
   Providers say they hope blocking access to a major portion of the net will pressure the courts to act. These providers also carry Usenet, so they, too, could be held liable for child pornography.<ep>
   ``Two businessmen were in prison simply because the authorities still don't understand the Internet or how it works,'' said Patrick Robin, founder of the Paris-based Association of French Internet Professionals, which is leading the protest.<ep>
   With the Internet neither controlled nor governed by any organization, the issue of who's ultimately to blame for illicit material (--) those who post it or those who allow access to it (--) is being debated worldwide.<ep>
   Pressured by German prosecutors probing child pornography, CompuServe Inc. in December blocked its 4 million subscribers around the world from reaching sex-oriented Internet sites.<ep>
   In the United States, there have been conflicting court rulings on whether Internet providers can be held responsible for content on the diffuse and global system, said Steele of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.<ep>
   France has fewer than 400,000 Internet subscribers, partly because of the popularity of its Minitel home computer system, which lets millions of French find phone numbers, buy theater tickets, reserve train seats and send messages. Pornography, too, is readily available on the Minitel.<ep>
   Internet providers say the volume of material on the network makes self-censorship impossible. They believe they are more like the telephone company, which is not liable for obscene phone calls made using its lines.<ep>
   ``Among all those messages, there are undoubtedly some with content that's against the law in France, just as some circulates in the mail or in the baggage at Air France,'' Robin said. ``But it's absolutely impossible for a provider to check everything.''<ep>
   On Thursday, the second day of the electronic strike, French computer users expressed support (--) even though they couldn't access popular Usenet discussion groups.<ep>
   ``We find it just incredibly maladroit that the providers could be charged as though they were pornographers,'' said Alexandre Gerard, of the Internet Cafe, in Paris.<ep>
