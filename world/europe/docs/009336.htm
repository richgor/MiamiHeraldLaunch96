   BERLIN -- (AP) -- For four weeks, millionaire Jan Philipp Reemtsma was chained to a cellar wall, sleeping on a cgt and reading books. Meanwhile, his family and friends placed newspaper ads and drove hundreds of miles in a desperate effort to arrange his release.<P>

   After two botched attempts to pay ransom, family <BR>
friends left $20 million in Swiss francs and German marks along a highway -- the largest ransom ever paid in Germany. Reemtsma was freed unharmed late Friday.<P>

   Police lifted a news blackout Saturday and revealed details of the monthlong saga for the first time.<P>

   Reemtsma, 43, who sold his share of the family tobacco business in 1980 for $200 million to devote himself to literary and social causes, was kidnapped March 25 in front of his villa in an upscale section of Hamburg.<P>

   He was released on a street in Maschen, just south of Hamburg, apparently in good condition, Michael Daleki, head of the police task force, said at a news conference in Hamburg.<P>

   The kidnappers gave Reemtsma a prepaid telephone card, but he found a house with a light on and called his wife, Ann-Katrin, from there.<P>

   In a letter read at the news conference, Reemtsma said he was ``exhausted and happy'' and offered ``very special thanks to the Hamburg police and the journalists'' who observed the news blackout.<P>

      Reemtsma told police he was walking outside his house at night when he was jumped by a man who beat him about the face. A second man helped carry him to a waiting car, driven by a third man.<P>

   Family friends had dropped off the ransom Thursday on an autobahn near Krefeld, a city near the Dutch border about 150 miles from Hamburg.<P>
