   MOSCOW -- Russia and the leaders of the world's seven richest democracies agreed Saturday to end nuclear tests by the fall and pledged new steps to keep nuclear materials out of the wrong hands.<P>

   An eight-nation summit, proposed and hosted by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, was long on rhetoric and short on breakthroughs. But the compliments and camaraderie from other world leaders were a huge boost to Yeltsin two months before a presidential election.<P>

   A lingering nuclear dispute between Moscow and Washington cast a shadow, with Yeltsin reiterating that Russia would sell nuclear technology and training to Iran. And there was no progress toward closing the Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the world's worst nuclear accident 10 years ago this month.<P>

   But Yeltsin and the leaders of the Group of Seven hailed their summit in the Kremlin's refurbished St. Catherine's Hall as a resounding commitment to lessen the potentially catastrophic dangers of nuclear weaponry and energy gone awry.<P>

   They also signed separate declarations on improving nuclear protection and combating nuclear smuggling.<P>

   ``Today we took another step back from the nuclear precipice,'' President Clinton declared at a news conference.<P>

   The summit was partly overshadowed by the troubles in the Middle East, with the participants directing efforts to obtain a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas.<P>

   It brought no progress toward closing Chernobyl, although the Group of Seven did reaffirm a commitment to provide Ukraine with $3.1 billion in aid to do so.<P>

   And Clinton said he remained troubled by Russia's determination to proceed with its $800 million deal with Iran to build a 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactor. Washington fears the technology will be used in a clandestine nuclear weapons program; Moscow insists that's impossible.<P>

   But the top-level meeting on nuclear issues brought strong declarations of resolve to tackle the biggest problems more urgently. Talks were held, and commitments renewed, on the safety of nuclear reactors and waste dumps, liability for accidents, disarmament, and steps to prevent nuclear terrorism and smuggling.<P>

   The most notable achievement was the pledge to try to sign an agreement by September -- well within world leaders' timetable -- banning all nuclear explosions.<P>

   The agreement apparently represented a conciliatory move by Russia, which had previously supported the idea of a ban but disagreed on wording calling for it to be complete.<P>
