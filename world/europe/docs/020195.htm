   ROME -- (AP) -- Italy took a turn to the left, results from national elections showed Monday, but just how far left was in question as disputes boiled among factions trying to form a coalition government.<P>

   Parties in the Olive Tree coalition, dominated by former Communists, won a slim three-seat majority in the national Chamber of Deputies and a more comfortable nine-seat majority in the Senate.<P>

   If the coalition succeeds in forming a government, as seems likely, the Italian welfare state appeared safe despite huge deficits and debt.<P>

   But on the day after the voting, seeds of discord were sprouting. The coalition's centrist candidate for premier, Romano Prodi, may be pushed further to the left to satisfy a hard-line Communist electoral coalition partner.<P>

   The same kind of political incompatibility doomed the conservative coalition government of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi in 1994 when the Northern League, which seeks autonomy for the north, withdrew support.<P>

   This time, Berlusconi's coalition lost without the Northern League, which made an unexpectedly strong showing running unaligned.<P>

   Already Monday, Prodi ruled out wage increases pegged to inflation, a cardinal tenet of the Communist Refoundation party.<P>

   ``It would bring dramatic problems,'' Prodi said of the measure, which was abandoned in 1985 as a major cause of inflation. ``We truly want to guarantee worker salaries, but not with wage-indexing, which represents a self-destructive tool.''<P>

   The Olive Tree won by uniting disparate elements on the political spectrum. It is dominated by the Democratic Party of the Left -- the former Communist Party -- but has former Christian Democrats in it along with Communist Refoundation.<P>

   ``The life of the government will depend . . . on how it corresponds with our positions,'' said Communist Refoundation leader Fausto Bertinotti, who nonetheless said the party would support the establishment of a Prodi government.<P>

   State television said President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro will designate a premier, probably Prodi, by May 20. The new premier would try to form Italy's 55th postwar government.<P>
