   STRASBOURG, France (--) Nobody pays much attention to the European Parliament.<ep>
   So the nearly 40-year-old institution hired a public relations firm to find out why.<ep>
   The answer the folks at Hill and Knowlton came up with was, in short: The European Union's 626-member assembly doesn't do much that interests the public.<ep>
   For many people, in fact, the Parliament is little more than a traveling medicine show stuffed with powerless windbags and washed up politicians having a final feed at the public trough.<ep>
   That is distressing to some, who see it as a potential balancing force as the Europe Union's only directly elected body and the only one truly representing the whole political spectrum of the EU's 370 million people.<ep>
   ``People think it should be a copy of national parliaments . . . and when they discover it's not, they think it's not worth much,'' says the Parliament's president, Klaus Haensch of Germany.<ep>
<m1>EU trio of major institutions<ep>
<m0>   Wilfried Martens, the former Belgian prime minister who heads the center-right European Peoples Party grouping in the assembly, admits: ``There is a certain skepticism about our ability to act.''<ep>
   Thus, with the EU beginning a yearlong review of its policies and institutions, the Parliament is looking to expand its powers.<ep>
   The assembly is one of the three major institutions of the 15-nation European Union.<ep>
   The others are the Council, which consists of one minister from each of the member states, and the Commission, the EU's executive body. The Council can meet on any level (--) as a council of foreign ministers, or agriculture ministers, or at the top prime ministers and presidents. The Commission consists of 20 appointees independent of national governments.<ep>
   Originally, the European Parliament was purely consultative. Now, it has veto power over the EU budget and membership of the Commission.<ep>
   It also shares decision-making power with the Council in some areas. If Parliament rejects a Council decision, that rejection can only be overcome by a unanimous vote of the Council. In other areas, such as treaties with third countries, the Parliament can prevent the adoption of a Council proposal.<ep>
   ``The biggest problem is connecting with the people of Europe, making them see the role we play and the relevance of that role,'' says Pauline Green, a former London police officer who heads the 221-member Socialist group, the largest in Parliament.<ep>
   Perceptions aren't helped by the assembly's unusual operations.<ep>
   It meets one week a month in Strasbourg, a Rhine River city in France's Alsace region. It also meets several times a year in Brussels, where the EU's administrative agencies are headquartered. Parliamentary committee meetings are held in Brussels, too. Adding to the confusion, much of the Parliament staff is based in Luxembourg, which is about halfway between Brussels and Strasbourg.<ep>
   For each session, steel footlockers crammed with files and papers are trucked to Strasbourg or Brussels. Workmen haul them down the long corridors of Parliament office buildings and plunk one in front of each door, giving the place the look of a posh army barracks.<ep>
   ``The traveling is much tougher than I thought,'' said Charlotte Cederschiold, a new member of Parliament from Sweden. ``There is little time for reading, so much work has to be done at night. I didn't sleep much when I was a member of the Swedish Parliament. I never dreamed I would get less.''<ep>
<m1>Prominent members<ep>
<m0>   Members of Parliament are paid the same salary as lawmakers in their home countries, so pay varies from individual to individual.<ep>
   The European Parliament is littered with big names and fading stars: former French Prime Minister Michel Rocard; former Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter; Daniel Cohn-Bendit, once a student revolutionary in France known as ``Danny the Red,'' now a German Green; French newspaper magnate Robert Hersant; out-of-work former French ministers Jack Lang and Bernard Kouchner; even Nana Mouskouri, the Greek singer.<ep>
