<m0>   MOSCOW (--) (AP) (--) Chechen rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev reportedly was buried in the breakaway region Wednesday, eliminating the top player in the bitter 16-month war against Russia that has tainted Boris Yeltsin's presidency.<ep>
   The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Dudayev's vice president and reported successor as saying Dudayev was killed in a Russian airstrike Sunday.<ep>
   Officials in Moscow said they were trying to confirm Dudayev's death, and the Russian military denied any involvement.<ep>
   Dudayev ``was buried this morning in the presence of close relatives at one of the rural cemeteries in southern Chechnya,'' said Chechen Vice President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev. Top Chechen officials said Yandarbiyev has succeeded Dudayev as head of the separatist movement.<ep>
   Yandarbiyev would not say where Dudayev was buried, but earlier reports said it would be in Shalazhi, site of his mother's grave. Dudayev's burial followed two days of conflicting reports about his fate.<ep>
   Dudayev's death could have major consequences on the war in Chechnya.<ep>
   His fighters could splinter, making negotiations with Moscow even more difficult. As a martyr, Dudayev could become a powerful rallying symbol for his followers, who have already said they will avenge his death.<ep>
   However, peace talks had gone nowhere under Dudayev, and it was possible that a successor could emerge with new ideas.<ep>
   The most wanted man in Russia, Dudayev had eluded the Russians since his capital, Grozny, fell early last year. His death comes at a time of intensified Russian airstrikes against suspected rebel strongholds.<ep>
   Russia's military brass, who suffered a loss of more than 90 men in a rebel ambush last week, are largely ignoring an order by Yeltsin that combat operations cease except in cases of self-defense.<ep>
   ITAR-Tass quoted one unidentified Russian Interior Ministry official as saying Dudayev was killed in retaliation for the ambush.<ep>
   The first report of Dudayev's death came Tuesday from Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov, a former Dudayev peace negotiator who released a statement in Grozny saying he had seen the body.<ep>
   The statement, carried by ITAR-Tass, said Dudayev was wounded Sunday in a Russian airstrike when he walked into a field to hold talks with a mediator by satellite phone. He died that night, it said.<ep>
   The report also said a top aide to Dudayev was killed in the attack near Gekhi-Chu, 18 miles southwest of Grozny.<ep>
   But many Russian officials and politicians insisted the reports were a rebel trick. Some Russian officials said Wednesday they were waiting to see a body before accepting Dudayev's death.<ep>
