<m0>   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (--) (AP) (--) The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal on Friday rejected defense attempts to halt proceedings against a Bosnian Serb general released from custody this week because he is dying of cancer.<ep>
   The tribunal ordered Gen. Djordge Djukic released on humanitarian grounds Wednesday, but said his indictment for crimes against humanity should stand. The charges stem from his role in the Serb siege of Sarajevo. <m1><ep>
<m0>   A Dutch doctor told the tribunal that Djukic has pancreatic cancer that has spread to other organs and his spine. His condition means he is unlikely to face trial. But Friday's hearing, on defense motions filed last month, went ahead as a way of bolstering the tribunal's case law for future proceedings.<ep>
   Djukic, 62, arrived back in Belgrade on Thursday and was immediately taken to the main military hospital for treatment.<ep>
   Djukic's lawyer said Thursday that if the general recovers, he will return to The Hague to clear his name. Djukic has always maintained his innocence.<ep>
   In its first of three motions Friday to dismiss charges, the defense asked the tribunal to order a halt to proceedings against Djukic in Sarajevo, where Djukic was arrested Jan. 30. The other two motions said the indictment was too vague and requested evidence taken from Djukic be thrown out. <m1><ep>
