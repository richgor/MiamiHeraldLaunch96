<m0>   BONN (--) (AP) (--) Ignoring opponents' shouts that he is heartless, Chancellor Helmut Kohl unveiled a plan Friday for the biggest overhaul of the German welfare state in a decade.<ep>
   In a speech to Parliament, Kohl insisted the cost-cutting measures are necessary to reduce record high unemployment and revive the ailing economy, which is the engine of Europe.<ep>
   Kohl conceded the economy is likely to grow by only three-quarters of 1 percent for the whole of 1996. But he insisted Germany is not teetering on a recession.<ep>
   Kohl's plan would reduce sick pay, raise the retirement age for women, cut disability and jobless benefits, and make it easier for German companies to fire workers.<ep>
   <m4>Kohl<m2><ql>
<m0>It also foresees sweeping tax reform, as well as support for small and medium-size companies.<ep>
   His proposals are designed to cut federal spending by $16.5 billion this year. Germany's communities and 16 federal states are being asked to match the federal cut.<ep>
   Kohl said Germany has fallen behind France, Sweden and other countries that have been slicing social welfare programs to put their economic houses in order.<ep>
   ``Many of our neighbors have already embarked on structural changes, which until recently they themselves did not consider capable of being implemented,'' Kohl told the lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag.<ep>
   Kohl also reminded Germans that they have ``shorter working hours and longer vacations than workers in nearly all other countries,'' and that ``hardly any country has pensions as high'' as Germany.<ep>
   Labor costs have been driven up over the years and this must stop if Germany wants to be competitive in the 21st Century, Kohl said.<ep>
   Kohl's opponents criticized his plan as unfair to the elderly, unemployed and couples with children. ``We stand at the edge of dismantling'' the welfare state, said Joschka Fischer of the Greens.<ep>
   Fischer said Kohl's program proves the government coalition has a ``merciless social bias'' that shifts economic burdens onto those who can least afford them.<ep>
