<m0>   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (--) (AP) (--) In a case that will spotlight Serbia's role in the Bosnian war, the World Court begins hearings this week on genocide charges leveled against Belgrade by the Bosnian government.<ep>
   Bosnia claims Serbia has ``extensively violated'' the 1948 Paris Convention Against Genocide, marking the first time a nation has been charged with genocide before the U.N. court.<ep>
   A guilty verdict could undermine the Bosnian peace process by paving the way for the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal to indict Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who is widely blamed for having instigated the Bosnian war but is now seen as a vital peacemaker.<ep>
   The World Court, formally the International Court of Justice, handles complaints between nations, while the tribunal, which functions separately, deals with individuals.<ep>
   The World Court case has been overshadowed by impending war crimes prosecutions of individuals, most of them Bosnian Serbs, by the tribunal.<ep>
   The nation-against-nation proceedings at the World Court will probably focus on the political and military policies of Milosevic's government in Belgrade, the Yugoslav and Serbian capital.<ep>
   While the Belgrade link is widely alleged, no clear evidence has emerged of Serbia's hand guiding Bosnian Serb forces.<ep>
   Monday's hearing is to begin with Serbia challenging the court's jurisdiction and claiming the war was an internal matter not covered by the Genocide Convention.<ep>
   In a press statement, Bosnia said it will prove Belgrade's ``active, substantial and leading role in the war'' with documents recently seized by the Bosnian government from areas evacuated by the Bosnian Serbs.<ep>
   But Serbia, which together with Montenegro now forms Yugoslavia, has denied responsibility for the Bosnian Serb rebels and maintains the 43-month conflict was strictly a civil war.<ep>
   ``An issue that still exists is the question to what extent Serbia as a state was involved in the conflict,'' said World Court expert Terry Gill, a professor of international law at Utrecht University.<ep>
   ``If you can prove that Serbia was responsible, that sort of equals an indictment of Milosevic,'' Gill said.<ep>
