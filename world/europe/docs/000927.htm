   Dzhokhar Dudayev led Chechnya's drive for independence from Russia, wrapping himself in the mantle of Islamic warrior-prophets. They fought the czars; he fought their successors.<P>

   From his infancy in exile in Central Asia to his death, reportedly by a Russian missile, Dudayev's life was shaped -- and eventually destroyed -- by his relation to Russian power.<P>

   Dudayev was born in 1944, the year that Stalin deported Chechens en masse in freezing cattle trucks to Central Asia for alleged collaboration with Nazi Germany. Hundreds of thousands of Chechens died, including Dudayev's father and older brother.<P>

   ``Russian history is one of barbarism, stealing and killing, especially here,'' Dudayev said recently. Chechens ``wear this history in our genes.''<P>

   Despite that history, Dudayev spent most of his life in the uniforms of the Soviet state. He rose to the rank of general in the Soviet air force and gaining command of a strategic bomber force in Estonia -- a remarkable achievement considering Russian discrimination against Chechens.<P>

   But he displayed anti-Russian leanings as early as 1989, allowing Estonian nationalists to run up their flag at the air base he commanded in Soviet Estonia.<P>

   He shot to fame in 1991 when, elected Chechen president in a vote Russian officials claim was fraudulent, he declared Chechnya's independence.<P>

   As Chechnya's vigorous trade in arms and narcotics took off, Dudayev's notoriety grew -- this time as leader of what the Kremlin called a ``gangster state.'' His predilection for wide lapels and fedoras and his coterie of heavily armed bodyguards only promoted his outlaw image.<P>

   His standoff with Russia turned violent in 1994, when Russian troops moved into Chechnya to crush his rebellion. In the ensuing months, as Russian troops slowly gained control of the capital and forced Dudayev to take refuge in the mountains, the rebel adopted an increasingly religious tone.<P>

   Recalling his 19th Century forebears, Dudayev regularly fulminated against ``satanic forces'' in the Kremlin.<P>

   ``We have turned away from the Western democracies and we look to Islamic virtues,'' he said.<P>
