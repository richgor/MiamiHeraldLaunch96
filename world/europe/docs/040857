<m0>   MOSCOW (--) (AP) (--) A day after the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton said Saturday he will sign Congress' new anti-terrorism bill but complained that important parts of the measure ``were left on the cutting room floor.''<ep>
   The president, broadcasting his weekly radio address from Russia, said he was disappointed that Congress dropped provisions that would have made it easier for authorities to wiretap all phones used by suspected terrorists.<ep>
   He also said police should have more leeway to investigate and prosecute terrorists who use machine guns, sawed-off shotguns and explosive devices.<ep>
   At a post-summit news conference, Clinton complained about political attacks from home by presidential rival Bob Dole and other Republicans.<ep>
   The president also squeezed in some Moscow sightseeing near Red Square, waving to well-wishers and shaking hands with surprised Russians. He ducked into a bakery and bought a long loaf of Russian bread.<ep>
   Walking across the empty expanse of Red Square, Clinton stopped for the requisite picture in front of onion-domed St. Basil's Cathedral.<ep>
   ``God, I love this place,'' he declared.<ep>
