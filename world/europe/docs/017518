<m0>   MOSCOW (--) (AP) (--) The world chess federation said Friday it has dropped plans to hold its championship in Iraq and will hold the match in southern Russia instead. <ep>
   The federation, known by its French acronym FIDE, had chosen Baghdad for the championship between Gata Kamsky and Russian Anatoly Karpov.<ep>
   The United States denounced the proposal and refused to grant a travel visa to Kamsky, a Russian emigre living in the United States and seeking U.S. citizenship. Karpov is Russian.<ep>
   FIDE's president said the 20-day championship will begin June 1 in Elista.<ep>
   But there were reports that Kamsky does not want to play the match in Elista, citing fears for his security.<ep>
