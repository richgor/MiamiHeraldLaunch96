<m0>   ROME (--) By taking a step to the center, Italy's former Communists broke through a last barrier in national elections Sunday, sharing with their centrist partners a victory in both houses of Parliament and for the first time ever, a chance to govern the country.<ep>
   Jubilant and even a little surprised at their triumph, leaders of the center-left coalition known as the Olive Tree savored a moment that for decades had eluded the mighty Italian Communist Party and in recent elections, its principal heir, the Democratic Party of the Left.<ep>
   ``The Olive Tree has the numbers to govern,'' said Romano Prodi, 56, an economist who for the past year has been the moderate face of Italy's new left and is now slated to be its next prime minister. ``Governing is a tremendously difficult thing in Italy, but now it is not impossible.''<ep>
   The elections, Italy's third in four years, also dealt a humbling setback to Silvio Berlusconi, the media mogul and former prime minister, just two years after his center-right coalition was swept into power as the answer to Italy's chronic political woes.<ep>
   But as Berlusconi learned, winning elections and governing are two different things in Italy. Analysts predicted Prodi's government will face many of the same difficulties that derailed Berlusconi's government. <ep>
   Final election results showed the Olive Tree won control of the 315-seat Senate and won 284 seats in the 630-member Chamber of Deputies. The numbers are enough to ensure that Prodi, whose only other government experience was stewardship of Italy's largest state-owned company, will be given the task of forming Italy's 55th government since the end of World War II.<ep>
   But for an absolute majority in the lower house, Prodi and the Olive Tree probably will have to turn to 35 deputies from the Communist Refounding Party, a group of hard-core Communists. <ep>
   The Communists' votes on several issues could prove costly.<ep>
   ``The problems will arise later,'' said commentator Sergio Romano. ``They will arise when the 1997 budget comes up, which will require a mix of taxes and cuts that will be difficult to do if they have to have the Communists' agreement.''<ep>
