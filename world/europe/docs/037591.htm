   ROME -- (AP) -- When Italians vote today in the third national election in four years, the biggest victory would be an end to the political paralysis that has dashed hopes for radical change.<P>

   The last year has been a sobering time after the seemingly earth-shaking political events of the early 1990s, when a far-reaching corruption scandal brought down Italy's main parties and led to some electoral reforms.<P>

   Those heady days vaporized when politicians became mired in the same factionalism and government instability that has existed since World War II.<P>

   The hope is that finally a clear political majority will emerge and form a strong government able to act decisively.<P>

   Italians may be disappointed.<P>

   The two main political blocs were ranked dead even in polls before the March 31 deadline on publishing opinion surveys.<P>

   If neither side finishes strongly enough to form a government, politicians say they will try to rewrite election laws once again to ensure a clear outcome the next time.<P>

   After the corruption scandal, Parliament changed the electoral system to pick all senators and three-fourths of the Chamber of Deputies by majority vote in single-member districts. The other deputies are allotted to parties based on their proportion of the total vote -- the way all seats were doled out in the previous system -- and that allowed numerous small parties to keep footholds in Parliament.<P>

   But enlarging on reforms may not be easy. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro called this election three years early after both sides failed to agree on reforms in February.<P>

   The election will mark the fortunes of one man in particular: Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate who founded his own party and won the last election in 1994 against all expectations. He served as premier for eight months before a coalition ally withdrew support, forcing him to resign.<P>

   Berlusconi, on trial for corruption charges that he calls a political vendetta, has hinted he will walk away from politics if he loses this time.<P>

   He heads a center-right coalition made up of his Forza Italy (Let's Go Italy) party; the National Alliance, descended from Italy's neo-fascist movement; and a handful of conservative-leaning former Christian Democrats.<P>

   The former Communists dominate the rival center-left coalition, which includes another slice of the ex-Christian Democratic party and the hard-line Communist Refoundation.<P>

   The center-left proposes an economist and former state industrialist, Romano Prodi, for the premiership.<P>

   Swing votes could come from defectors of the Northern League, a regional-based populist party that soared in the early 1990s but has declined recently.<P>

   Italy has been without an elected government since Berlusconi's resignation in December 1994. Berlusconi's ex-treasury minister, Lamberto Dini, was installed as the head of a nonaligned ``technocrat'' government.<P>

   Dini, now acting premier, is running for the Chamber of Deputies with the center-left.<BR>
