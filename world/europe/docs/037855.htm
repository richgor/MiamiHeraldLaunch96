   MOSCOW -- Chechen separatists vowed Wednesday to continue their war with Russia after rebel commanders confirmed the death of their leader, who was killed by a rocket attack while talking on a portable satellite telephone in a field outside Grozny, the Chechen capital.<P>

   Dzhokhar Dudayev's death Sunday was confirmed Wednesday by one of his top field commanders, Shamil Basayev, who announced that Dudayev had been succeeded by Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, a literary scholar and hard-line separatist.<P>

   Basayev said Dudayev was buried in the village of Shalazhi, southeast of Grozny.<P>

   Yandarbiyev, who has been described as a staunch ideologist for Chechen separatism, declared that Dudayev's death ``has not broken the Chechen people, and they are ready to continue the fight for independence.''<P>

   But the killing of Dudayev, apparently by an air-to-ground rocket fired by Russian forces early Sunday, casts more doubt on the recent peace initiative of President Boris Yeltsin. <P>

   Dudayev's death ``will change the whole situation with the so-called peace settlement plan, which, as is known, has yet to be fulfilled for even a single day,'' said Russian presidential candidate Grigory Yavlinsky.<P>

   A key provision of the Yeltsin initiative was an offer to negotiate with Dudayev through intermediaries. The rebel leader's killing may postpone any such talks.<P>

   Mintimer Shaimiev, the president of the Russian republic of Tatarstan, said he doubted any successor could galvanize the Chechens around the idea of independence as Dudayev had.<P>

 ``Now it is unclear how his cohorts will behave in this situation -- whether they will be as united and as obsessed by the common idea, as it was they were under Dudayev, or whether their ranks will be split and their ideas will be polarized,'' he said.<P>

   Evidence came to light Wednesday suggesting Dudayev had been hunted down by Russian forces, although Russian authorities denied it.<P>

   News reports said Dudayev had gone to a field near the Chechen village of Gekhi-Chu to use his satellite telephone. <P>

   According to these reports, the phone signal was intercepted by the Russians, who scrambled into planes or helicopter gunships and fired rockets at the site.<P>
