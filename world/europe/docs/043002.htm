   MOSCOW -- President Clinton and other Western leaders heaped praise on Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday at a summit meeting in which worries about nuclear accidents and illicit smuggling took a back seat to helping Yeltsin politically.<P>

   Reveling in the accolades eight weeks before he is to run for re-election, Yeltsin reaffirmed that Russia would agree to a comprehensive test ban treaty under which all nuclear explosions would be prohibited. He joined the others in striving to complete the treaty by September for signing at the United Nations.<P>

   Yeltsin cautioned, however, that China has not agreed to such a strict limitation, which is backed by the United States, Britain and France. <P>

   Treaty negotiations in Geneva are dogged by technical disputes over the scope of nuclear explosions and what kind of experiments would be ruled out.<P>

   While the Western leaders have worried openly in recent years about potential reactor accidents and the spread of fissile materials from the former Soviet Union, they muted their concerns Saturday to avoid embarrassing Yeltsin before the June 16 election.<P>

   Two years ago, at a summit in Rome, leaders of the Group of Seven major industrial democracies called for ``early closure of high-risk reactors,'' especially those in the former Eastern Bloc. <P>

   But Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry has vigorously opposed shutting down reactors, and on Saturday, the Group of Seven leaders softened their approach, saying that ``existing reactors which do not meet current safety requirements'' should be ``brought to an acceptable level of safety or [cease] operation.''<P>

   Meeting a decade after the Chernobyl disaster, the leaders were joined by President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine, and they reaffirmed their earlier commitment to provide $3 billion in exchange for Ukraine's promise to close the Chernobyl complex by the turn of the century. But French President Jacques Chirac later issued a separate statement saying existing safety standards at Chernobyl are ``inadequate.''<P>

   On other issues, the leaders called for more strenuous international efforts, including sharing information and police work, to combat the smuggling of nuclear materials. They did not, however, commit additional money for building secure facilities to guard against diversion of fissile materials. <P>

   Clinton said he had made no progress in efforts to persuade Russia to halt its $800 million deal with Iran to build a 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactor. Washington fears the technology will be used in a clandestine nuclear weapons program; Moscow insists that's impossible.<BR>
