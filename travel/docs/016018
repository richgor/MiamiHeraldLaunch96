<m0>   Summer may be hot, but the resort deals you can get during that season are even hotter.<ql>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   At the famed Breakers hotel in Palm Beach, for example, the Golf Spectacular package goes for $271 per person, double occupancy, in summer compared to $519 in the winter. Innisbrook Resort in Tarpon Springs is offering its Relax Under the Sun package for $79 per person per night, double occupancy, in summer compared to $119 in winter. And in the Keys, the Sheraton Key Largo offers its two-night Key Retreat package for $246 single occupancy, $266 double in summer compared to $392 and $486, respectively.<ep>
   Some resorts don't even offer packages in the high winter season, so the off season is the only time they are available. <m1> <m0>And for many travelers, the bargain summer rates make it possible for them to visit tonier resorts that at other times of the year are too pricey.<ep>
   Because children are out of school in summer, many packages shift their emphasis to family programs, offering special activities for youngsters and teens. Golf and tennis rates drop dramatically, with some resorts including unlimited greens fees and tennis fees in their packages. <m1> <ep>
<m0>   Here is a sampling of summer packages around the state:<ep>
