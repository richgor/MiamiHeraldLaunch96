<m0>King church to open during Games<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,2<ql>
<ep>
<m0>  The National Park Service has signed a 99-year lease for the church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his father preached, and will open it to visitors during the Summer Olympics. <m1> <m0>In exchange, Ebenezer Baptist Church will get land for a sanctuary next to the park service's new visitor center across the street. The civil rights leader and his father served as pastors of the church, and his mother, Alberta King, was fatally shot there during a 1974 service. The church has outgrown the building and has been seeking a new sanctuary since 1987.<ql>

<m0>Orlando in top five airports<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,2<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   Among international airports, those at Manchester (England), Changi (Singapore) and Schiphol (Amsterdam) placed highest in a recent International Air Transport Association survey of on-the-ground service in 1995. Orlando (Florida) and Sydney (Australia) filled out the first five. The Narita (Tokyo) and Athens (Greece) airports received the lowest ratings, with Kennedy (New York) and Orly (Paris) also among the least satisfactory. More than 45,000 passengers were surveyed. <ql>

<m0>   The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, now one of Washington's leading tourist destinations, has instituted a toll-free number, (800) 400-9373, for ordering advance tickets. A service fee of $2.75 is assessed for each ticket, which itself is free . . . Princess Cruises has installed what it says is the industry's first direct ship telephone service in three of its ships. The 900 number allows callers to be connected directly to the purser's office, rather than requiring the caller to contact the INMARSAT operator or knowing the vessel ID. Cost is $8.95 per minute. <ql>
