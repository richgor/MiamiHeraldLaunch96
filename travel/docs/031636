<m0>   GLASGOW, Scotland (--) The tour guide in Glasgow reacted in mock horror, pretending to be utterly shocked that such a question would even be asked in her presence.<ep>
   ``Edinburgh?'' she said, trying to appear aghast. ``Why should I ever go to Edinburgh? We have everything they have and we're much more civilized about it.''<ql>
<m1><styl>indentr,2l,0,3.2i,10p<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   Her response to an inquiry about how many times a year she visits Scotland's capital city was hardly surprising. In Edinburgh two days earlier, we'd been given a similar reply, only about Glasgow.<ep>
   They're a mere 45 miles apart, but Glasgow and Edinburgh pretend to be light years away from each other when it comes to culture and tourist attractions. Spurred by the legendary Scottish pride, the rivalry (--) earnest or not (--) is logical.<ep>
   It's also quite beneficial to the tourist because the competition to outdo each other has produced a wealth of attractions that make both cities appealing.<ep>
   And the best part of visiting both is that eating haggis is not mandatory.<ep>
   In fact, the stuff isn't easy to find. <ep>
   In an effort to be fair to both, because both are fair cities, here are some of the highlights:<ql>
<m0>EDINBURGH<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Go to Edinburgh, see the castle.<ep>
   You can hardly not see the castle because it dominates the city's skyline and history.<ep>
   Actually, Edinburgh Castle is more of a fortress than a castle. Construction began in the seventh century and it's still going on. So it's possible to visit the tiny St. Margarite's Chapel, which is centuries old, and the Scottish National War Memorial, which is less than a decade old, without leaving the grounds.<ep>
   History buffs can take a guided tour through the sprawling complex and learn about the various revolutions and upheavals centered on the castle. Others are free to roam around at their own pace and glean knowledge from the signs and gift shops.<ep>
   A note of caution: Keep track of the time. At 1 p.m. every day, a field gun is fired from the windswept battlements. If you're not expecting it, the blast is more frightening than a charging haggis.<ep>
   About a mile east of the castle, down Royal Road, sits Holyrood Palace, the Royal House of Stuart also known as the Palace of Holyroodhouse. It's Queen Elizabeth's official residence when she's in the country, so on those days the public is barred from entering. But her visits are rare.<ep>
   The most outstanding thing about the palace is the ceilings in several rooms. Crafted in plaster by 17th-Century artisans lying on their backs on scaffolding, the ceilings feature three-dimensional unicorns, cherubs, people and wreaths. The tour guides say it took a year to sculpt each ceiling.<ep>
   Visitors must take a tour inside the palace, but outside there are no time constraints to poke around the ruins of an old abbey and well-kept gardens. <ep>
<m0>A walking town<ql>
<m0>   Most of Edinburgh's major attractions are close to each other, making it a walking town.<ep>
   It's possible, during an easy stroll through the heart of the city, to pass a store selling $500 suits, a hamburger stand (no, they don't make haggisburgers), St. Giles Cathedral with its high vaults and arches and a pub where Sir Walter Scott or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle may have taken a wee sma' sip.<ep>
   Edinburgh offers three national galleries, two royal museums, 60 brands of whiskey at the Whisky Heritage Center, a zoo with Europe's largest penguin colony and more than 700 pubs, strategically located to stave off terrible thirsts.<ep>
   Some of the more interesting pubs are along the Grassmarket, just below the fortress. The area was declared an open market in 1477 by James III but is better known as the former site of the public gallows.<ep>
   For something more modern, the Forth Rail Bridge crosses the Firth of Forth just north of the city. It's particularly appealing when a small boat drifts underneath while a train roars overhead.<ep>
   Edinburgh calls itself ``the city of festivals'' and stages at least 14 major productions every year. August may be the best time for hitting the highlights. The International Festival (--) a blend of music, dance and drama (--) is observing its 50th anniversary this year Aug. 11-Aug. 31. It will be preceded by such events as the Military Tattoo, a spectacular array of bagpipers and drum and bugle corps, scheduled Aug. 2-24; a jazz festival Aug. 3-10; and a blues festival Aug. 11-12.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Tickets go fast, however, so anyone planning to attend should be sure to make reservations well in advance.<ep>
<m0>GLASGOW<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   In most places, a trip to city hall means a visit to the office of a petty bureaucrat, usually to lodge a complaint. In Glasgow, however, the city hall is an art form that will help a visitor establish an appreciation of the city.<ep>
   From the outside, the building looks like many other governmental edifices in Great Britain (--) gray with towers. But inside, the hallways are marble and a huge staircase gracefully leads to upper levels rich in Victorian architecture.<ep>
   The banqueting room is so large and so ornate that the average tourist will speak in the same hushed tones used in cathedrals.<ep>
   Glasgow has been named the United Kingdom's City of Architecture and Design for 1999, but the celebration started in 1995. Building on that honor, the city is hosting a Festival of Visual Arts through 1996. The three major festival events include the opening of a new Gallery of Modern Art, the Charles Rennie Mackintosh exhibition to honor Scotland's most famous architect and designer, and the International Festival of Design.<ep>
   During the festival, local and international artists will display their works in shopping malls, restaurants and concert halls.<ep>
<m0>Must-see attractions<ql>
<m0>   Whether a stay in Glasgow is brief or extended, two stops should be on every must-see list.<ep>
   The first is the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, an absolutely beautiful building that houses an outstanding collection of artwork, ranging from oils to sculptures to photography, plus Scottish natural history, archaeology and artifacts from all across Europe. The exterior of the building is a deep red brick, and on a clear day, it lures photographers faster than haggis attracts a dinner invitation.<ep>
   The second is an area on Castle Street where the Glasgow Cathedral and the St. Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art face each other. The cathedral is a fine example of Gothic architecture, and the adjacent Western Necropolis has gravestones with numbers like A.D. 1237.<ep>
   The religious museum, billed as the first of its kind anywhere in the world, attempts to explore the variety of faiths accepted by the world population. Its most celebrated exhibit is Salvador Dali's <m0>Christ of St. John of the Cross.<m0> <ep>
   Also downtown are the Transport Museum, which focuses on shipbuilding, the Glasgow trams, locomotives, horse-drawn carriages and Scottish-built cars; and the 12th-Century Paisley Abbey, whose stained-glass windows rival those in European cathedrals.<ep>
   Although it's not quite within walking distance of downtown, a 20-minute bus or train ride to the Burrell Collection is time well invested. The gallery sits on a 360-acre parkland and contains more than 8,000 paintings and sculptures indoors and out.<ep>
   Equally appealing are the prices. Most major galleries in Glasgow and Edinburgh have free admission.<ep>
   Incidentally, for those who didn't see <m0>Braveheart<m0>  or aren't familiar with anything Scottish except that which comes in a bottle, haggis is a dish made of lungs, heart and other parts of a sheep or calf, mixed with suet, seasoning and boiled in the animal's stomach.<ep>
   It's not bad. But it's definitely not a delicacy.<ql>
