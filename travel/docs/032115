<m0>WHITE SPRINGS (--) Way down upon the Suwannee River, every Memorial Day weekend, Florida celebrates its heritage at the Stephen Foster Cultural Center. <ep>
       But unlike Stephen Foster's famous song, the focus is old <m0>folk traditions, <m0>not <m0>old folks. <m0>Hundreds of performers and crafts people, including legendary guitarist ``Doc Watson'' and PBS minstrel-storyteller David Holt, will gather at the state park along the Suwannee River for the 44th annual Florida Folk Festival. From May 24 until May 26, the 850-acre park will be filled with <m1> <m0>music and dancing. <m1> <ep>
<m0>          Five stages scattered around the grounds will provide nonstop entertainment ranging from country and bluegrass to Scottish bagpipes. <m1> <m0>In the evenings, there is dancing for everyone (--) Cajun zydeco, Latin, country and square dancing.<ep>
<m0>Sweet and soulful sounds<ep>
<m0> The festival experience is like none other.<ep>
          The day is beautiful (--) blue skies and puffy white clouds. <m1> <m0>Spanish moss hangs down from massive oaks and pines. The sweet and soulful sounds of bagpipes seem to attract like a magnet, reaching deep into the soul. <ep>
      At the main amphitheater stage, picnic coolers sit atop blankets and quilts spread out over grass sloping down to the stage area. All around fingers are snapping, heads are bobbing, lips are moving, and feet are keeping time to rhythms. Four people dance an impromptu jig. <ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>     Everywhere you see and hear stringed instruments (--) huge base fiddles, violins, banjos, harpsichords, zithers, guitars and dulcimers. <ep>
          The makeshift loudspeakers set the mood: <m0>Barefoot weather, it's good to have you back again . . . my feet are hungry for some oxygen.<m0> '' <m1>   <m0>A singer wails, ``Keep the faith boy and fill your cup. Ya gotta keep them tail feathers up,'' and the audience breaks into smiles. They chuckle over a quick ode to the ``first mosquito of spring.'' <ep>
<m0>Amazing performers<ep>
<m0>          The performers are amazing.<ep>
          A young woman in a long dress is playing a bass guitar larger than herself, keeping time with a tap of her huge boots.<ep>
          Another performer plays guitar, plays a harmonica and sings, all at the same time. Still another makes music with a washboard.<ep>
          In the background, a lilting, Irish-sounding female voice accompanied by an unfamiliar stringed instrument creates a haunting rendition of <m0>Shenandoah.<m0>  <ep>
<m1><ep>
<m0>          At the crafts area, the ``Tool Chest'' man enthralls onlookers with his collection of old woodworking tools and homey little stories about a peg-leg pig whose owners owe their lives to him. <ep>
        Among the crafts for sale are fossil teeth hand carvings, antler brooms, pottery and hand-forged metal items. Dulcimers range from $90 to $350 while a fancy hand-carved walking stick sells for $260.<ep>
      Sally Jones, born ``in a little log cabin on a red clay hill alongside a North Florida creek bank 79 years ago,'' demonstrates quilt making on her mother's treadle sewing machine. <ep>
      Nearby, the narrator at <m0>The Spirit of Clogging<m0>  instructs visitors to ``close your eyes. You just hear the rise and fall of the dance steps and you know what's going on.''<ep>
          A tent-covered stage rocks to and fro with a Caribbean/Latino beat. Musicians playing bongo drums and steel instruments accompany colorfully clad singers and dancers.<ep>
          The Florida State Fiddle Contest, with young and old fiddlers competing in various categories, is a crowd favorite. A young fiddler who can barely see over the microphone wows the audience.<ep>
      And then there's the food. How about Barbados curried goat at Ann Marie's Caribbean Cuisine Catering? Or Seminole fry bread, or Greek, Asian, Italian, Mexican and African-American favorites. It's a cultural smorgasbord. <ep>
<m0>Tales of swamp creatures<ep>
<m0>          At the Professional Storytelling area, kids and adults sit spellbound as Wayne Sims tells tales of swamp creatures and other earthly (and unearthly) delights.<ep>
 ``Storytelling makes people use their mental imaginations,'' Sims says. ``It builds a picture in your mind.''<ep>
          Yes, telling a story is what it's all about.<ep>
          ``Imagine yourselves riding across the vast, wind-swept plain,'' intones a musician as his fingers fly over the 100-stringed Russian bandura. ``You can feel the horses' rhythm beneath you.'' He strums a high pitched sound from the instrument (the faint hoof beats).<ep>
   ``You can hear the wind blowing in your ears,'' the bandura strumming intensifies. Through his hands and the bandura, he brings to life the screeching winds, the laughter, the vastness, the harshness of the Russian steppes. <ep>
          The melody disappears faintly <m1> <m0>into the distance as a rider might disappear into eternity.<ep>
          The audience explodes into wild applause. It is something they have never heard before and likely will never forget.<ep>
