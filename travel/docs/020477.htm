  PORT ORANGE, Fla. -- If you've got to be up the creek without a paddle, Spruce Creek is about as pretty a creek as there is to be up.<P>

  Paddling up Spruce Creek is one of many new ecotourism opportunities in Daytona Beach, better know for its automobile and motorcycle races. <P>

     One of the most scenic canoe trips on Spruce Creek departs from the historic Gamble Place mansion at 10 a.m. on the first and third Fridays of the month. <P>

   If the canoe isn't your style of river transportation, on the second and fourth Fridays, starting at 9 a.m. and every two hours thereafter as long as the demand is there, you can take a pontoon boat. Georgia Zern, an employee of Daytona Beach's Museum of Arts and Sciences, leads the two-mile, 90-minute tour of the deep, twisting stream, once a main vein of commerce for rum runners. <P>

  Zern, a Florida native with an unabashed love for the wilderness she navigates, narrates the tour, pointing out a centuries' old bald cypress. As Zern gently steers the pontoon boat across the coffee black water, a great blue heron watches from the shore. It apparently decides the visitors are friendly, and doesn't fly away. <P>

  In just two miles, the number and variety of trees leaning over the water is astounding: sweet gum, cedar, red maple, magnolia, pig nut hickory, wax myrtle, live oak, black gum, laurel oak, several varieties of pine, elms and other hardwoods. <P>

  A raccoon scampers up the bank, startling a turtle.<P>

   ``We see deer here a lot as well as otters,'' Zern said, ``and I have seen one small Florida panther. Of course, we see a lot of gators and quite a few endangered gopher tortoises.'' <P>

   In the winter, about 100 buzzards inhabit a half dozen oaks and cypress trees on the edge of the river. <P>

Easy access<BR>
  Ecotourism, even on a small scale, is catching on in every tourist market. Though not the Keys, nor the Everglades, upper east central Florida has more going for it than one might expect. Mainly, its natural shows are easy to get to.<P>

  Blue Springs State Recreational Area, just off I-4 at Orange City in western Volusia County, is a favorite of divers in warm weather and of manatees in cold weather, who winter in its warm waters. <P>

   Many visitors bring their scuba gear to Blue Springs. Others bring their walking shoes for the lengthy hiking trails that wind around the river that flows from the springs. There are wooden boardwalks in several areas. Much of the park is handicap accessible. Tomoka River adventures<BR>
  Canoe enthusiasts have found the Tomoka River system an enchanting place to explore. The place to start is Tomoka River State Recreation Area off U.S. 1 just north of Daytona Beach near Ormond Beach. <P>

  Nature lovers with a sharp eye can almost always spot a gator sunning on a bank or lying nearly submerged along the edge of the sawgrass. Birders can see sand hill cranes and wood storks, among other rare or endangered species. The park itself is great for hiking. <P>

  For people wanting less physical activity and a shot at seeing some bigger critters, A Tiny Cruise Line, at Daytona's Halifax River Marina on Basin Street, offers three cruises daily (Tuesday through Saturday), plus sunset cruises on Wednesdays and Fridays. The tour is aboard a replica of an 1890 paddle wheeler like the ones that ran the river at the turn of the century. <P>

   The midday trip is a bring-your-own-lunch river tour hunting for dolphins, manatees and other sea life. <BR>
