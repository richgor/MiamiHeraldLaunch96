   CARLSBAD, N.M. -- Even for a 10-year-old trudging behind a soft-spoken park ranger and stealing a glimpse through hundreds of adult legs, Carlsbad Caverns elicits a memorable first impression.<P>

   But a return visit as an adult renders an even deeper appreciation of one of America's genuine natural wonders.<P>

   ``It is better than any castle in England,'' a white-haired woman whispers reverently as she pauses on the trail. Gazing at yet another massive formation rising from the cavern floor, it's easy to concur.<P>

   As a child you can't imagine the wonder of a scene 500,000 years in the making -- a drop-by-drop process created by water trickling down or seeping through limestone. Layers and layers of calcite have created unique formations given magical names like cave pearls, popcorn and soda straws.<P>

83 caves<BR>
   Carlsbad Caverns National Park, in the foothills of the Guadalupe Mountains, covers more than 46,000 acres of desert and includes 83 known caves. The deepest is Lechuguilla, an undeveloped cavern that reaches 1,567 feet into the Earth. At 89.3 miles, it also is one of the longest caverns in the world.<P>

   The park's most famous attraction, Carlsbad Cavern, was made a national monument in 1923 and designated a national park in 1930. The most popular activities in Carlsbad are two self-guided tours -- the Natural Entrance Route and the Big Room -- and a tour of the King's Palace led by National Park Service rangers. Each covers about one mile and takes about 90 minutes.<P>

   An elevator will take visitors to the bottom of the caverns if they are not up to the challenge of the Natural Entrance Route, which leads more than 790 feet into the ground. The trail can be steep and slippery.<P>

   As you descend, you will slowly begin to feel the mystery and dankness of Carlsbad. Find a quiet spot and listen to the sparrows that are migratory residents. You also can hear the dripping water, a reminder that this cavern is still alive. The muffled laughs of visitors hang in air above you, and you can see the soft glow of flashlights carried by families hiking the switchback trail.<P>

   Highlights on the way down include the Iceberg Rock, Bat Cave, Devil's Spring, Green Lake Overlook and the Boneyard, a formation that looks like enormous chunks of Swiss cheese.<P>

Room 60 stories high<BR>
    A ``must-see'' tour at Carlsbad is the 60-stories-high Big Room route that skirts about 14 acres of the cavern's most famous formations, including the Bottomless Pit, Rock of Ages and Painted Grotto.<P>

   Cave enthusiasts will want to secure a spot on one of four daily tours of the remarkable King's Palace trail, which drops eight stories.<P>

   Ranger Dave Hutson likes to remind visitors how lucky they are compared to James White, who first mapped the cave. Today's visitors, he says, ``have 11,000 lights, three miles of paved road and two government employees as guides. White came down with just a rope and a lantern.''<P>

   The King's Palace route is theatrically lighted, allowing visitors to see subtle color variations in the rock as well as delicate formations.<P>

Darkness in the deep<BR>
   Perhaps the most dramatic moment of the tour is the blackout demonstration, when the lights are extinguished and visitors are left to imagine White's first wanderings in Carlsbad.<P>

   American Indians and settlers had known about the ``Bat Cave'' for many years, but it was White who first explored the caverns around the turn of the century. A ranch hand who worked in the area, White was drawn to what appeared to be smoke on the horizon. The ``smoke'' was the daily flight path of an estimated 10 million bats living in the caverns.<P>

   The tours account for only three miles of the 30-mile-long Carlsbad Cavern. Exploration continues by volunteers.
