   The list of ``don't go's'' is imposing, indeed. It includes such reputedly unfriendly countries as Libya, Iran and Afghanistan, as well as the downtown areas of Johannesburg, South Africa, and Lima, Peru.<P>

   Don't go, we are told, to Port Moresby, the capital of fascinating Papua New Guinea, and Kingston, the capital of Jamaica. Avoid the buses of Jerusalem, the beach areas of Rio de Janeiro, the New York subways after dark and the overnight train from Moscow to St. Petersburg.<P>

   The list is long and growing, with input from official State Department warnings and the exhortations of relatives and friends who have heard horror stories or perhaps even been burned.<P>

   We travelers are faced with a dilemma. Crime and terrorism are here to stay, so our choices are these: Do we become ostriches, digging our heads in the soil of our own backyards, or do we insist that no sporadic IRA bombings will prevent us from enjoying the theaters of London or the treasures of the British Museum? Do we cancel our religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land or do we insist that the 3,000th birthday celebration in Jerusalem is too big an event to miss?<P>

   The answers to such questions are highly personal. No danger short of World War III would keep me out of London, Jerusalem or even Port Moresby -- but that's me. Still, I would not urge someone who is afraid to go, regardless of how baseless I might consider that fear to be. There's no point in traveling unless you're comfortable doing it. You can't enjoy Seville, for example, if you're in constant fear of having your pocket picked.<BR>
Learn how to cope<BR>
<P>

   That doesn't mean you should ignore the warnings and threats. Rather, determine how to cope. For example, in New York, I often use a subway station where a young visitor from Utah was slain while defending his mother from muggers. It was horrible, but I feel that as long as I wait for my train near other subway riders and don't stand precariously at the edge of the platform, I am safe. Besides, that station is terribly convenient.<P>

   Kashmir, however, is a different story. When I was living and working in New Delhi, I'd seek refuge there every May to escape the steaming northern Indian plains. I'd take my wife, our two infant sons and their nanny, and off we'd go for a refreshingly spring-like two weeks on a houseboat in Nagin Bagh, a charming, serene lake on the outskirts of Srinagar, the Kashmiri capital.<P>

   That was 35 years ago. Even if I still lived in India, I couldn't go to Kashmir anymore. The state has been torn by armed terrorism for years in the seemingly endless dispute between India and Pakistan over who owns it. There has even been sporadic terrorism against foreigners.<P>

   The whole world of travel was different 35 years ago. For example, I never hesitated to walk alone at night in downtown Calcutta. Poverty was rampant and beggars abundant -- human degradation was pervasive and depressing. Yet I never felt in danger, and I was never harmed. On the contrary, during a festival week, street dancers were delighted to have a foreigner join them, and I made new friends. Today, Calcutta, like every big city, suffers from an escalating crime rate.<P>

   Once, long, long ago, I was hitchhiking in France. I got many rides by waving a small American flag in front of passing cars. Today I would probably be ignored if not jeered.<BR>
Times have changed<BR>
<P>

   So, in 1996, I don't go to Kashmir, I don't walk the night-time streets of Calcutta (or the Bronx), and I don't advertise my nationality in France, but I DO ride subways and local buses in many cities and stroll through crowded bazaars. I am well aware that I am older and physically more vulnerable than most strollers, and I usually carry a camera, which identifies me as a tourist. (But why shouldn't I carry a camera? A purpose of my travels is to take pictures for my scrapbooks and to show the folks at home.)<P>

   Some precautions, however, have become so much a part of my traveling life that I am hardly conscious of them. For example, I carry with me only what I need. No expensive jewelry, no large amounts of cash, no credit cards besides those that I expect to use. I distribute essential valuables around my body: some in a pouch hanging inside my shirt from my neck, some in a wallet inside my pants and clipped to my belt, a small amount of ready cash in my pocket. If I am pickpocketed, I won't lose everything.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<P>

   <LI> Keep in the hotel safe whatever valuables you won't need immediately. Never store valuables beneath a mattress or in a locked suitcase kept in your hotel room.<P>

   <LI> Avoid dense crowds. Be especially careful when your attention might be diverted, such as when standing in line or getting on or off buses, trains or airplanes.<P>

   <LI> Don't leave your luggage.<P>

   <LI> Don't walk close to the street where speeding motorcyclists can grab your purse. Any pocketbook should have a zipper top with a flap over it, facing your body.<P>

   <LI> Don't hang your pocketbook on the door of a public toilet, where it can be snatched from outside.<P>

   <LI> When riding escalators, be especially careful where the up and down pass close to each other. Keep your pocketbook on the far side.<P>

   <LI> Keep a record of unspent travelers checks someplace other than the checks themselves. This will expedite replacement of losses.<P>

   <LI> Keep a separate photocopy of the identification page of your passport.<P>

   <LI> Study maps discreetly. Don't unfold them conspicuously on a crowded street corner, but preferably in a restaurant or hotel room.<P>

   <LI> If, despite all precautions, you become a victim, report it to the police promptly and get a copy of the official police report. You will probably need it for insurance claims.<P>
