         In this day of baby-boomer parenting, hundreds of Florida resorts proclaim themselves ``family friendly.'' But a good family resort has more than a swimming pool and a list of organized activities.<P>

          It has an attitude. An attitude that kids count. An attitude that smiles, and sometimes bursts out laughing -- with a mouth full of milk. The staff knows kids, and it shows.<P>

        The staff at the Holiday Inn SunSpree in Orlando, for instance, is urged to attend Clown College. A raccoon character on top of the building catches the eyes of little ones. <P>

          Inside, kids have their own candy house check-in counter, where they receive a bag of goodies. A castle playroom in the lobby does the final sell job on kids. Holiday Inn Maingate East in Kissimmee has a similar set up. <P>

    Many resorts use mascot characters to endear kids to the property. The characters are visible at meal times or available for nightly tuck-ins if you reserve ahead of time.<BR>
What to ask<BR>
<P>

          Every child is different, so every parent's vision of the perfect family resort varies. All are concerned about safety. Parents who are relinquishing control of their kids for the day want to retain as much control as they can.<P>

       During your initial phone call to the resort, ask to speak to the recreation director. Find out the ratio of counselors to children, the staff's qualifications and company safety precautions. <P>

   Do the director and counselors have CPR and first-aid training? If there are swimming activities, are the counselors certified as lifeguards?<P>

        Good resorts abide by HRS guidelines for day care centers: one adult to 15 children ages 3 and older. Most programs should at least require a sign-in and sign-out procedure. This often involves disclaimers, especially if the program includes field trips. Be sure to jot down allergies, swimming abilities, comfort items (blankies, pacifiers) and any other hints for counselors who will care for your child. <P>

     Florida programs should be outdoor-focused, in tune with our distinct environment.<P>

   Here's a sampling of six Florida resorts with family-friendly programs.<P>

Keys to ecology<BR>
<P>

   Oceanfront Cheeca Lodge in the middle Florida Keys consistently wins awards for its environmental responsibility. So when it came time to design a children's program, naturally, the focus was great outdoors.<P>

        Camp Cheeca restricts its participants to ages 6 to 12 because activities require skills and a long attention span. For instance, they may spend a morning fishing. Anything hooked is released -- after a quiz session reviewing what the children were taught earlier in the Camp Cheeca Treehouse.<P>

        In this wooden ``classroom,'' campers learn about fish color adaptations, the danger of plastic to marine life, and sea life specimen identification through game and crafts formats. <P>

        Camp Cheeca participants are kept busy with nature walks, snorkeling, swimming, sand sculptures, tennis and a scavenger hunt.<P>

        Field trips take participants canoeing at Long Key, snorkeling at Pennekamp and sightseeing at the Dolphin Research Center and Theatre of the Sea.<P>

A separate space<BR>
<P>

   Holiday Inn SunSpree and Main Gate East in Kissimmee based their family suites on the belief that parents and children need their separate space while on vacation. Bunk beds and media centers are part of cubby rooms separated by walls -- decorated as forts, circus tents or igloos -- from the rest of the room.<P>

   SunSpree's kids center provides day care for employees' children, so each staff member is licensed by the State Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. The all-day program allows you to enroll your child for one-hour time slots. Another advantage, no matter the time of year or week, there are always playmates at the center.<P>

   Both Holiday Inns issue parents special identification for reclaiming their children. If the parents are leaving the grounds, they must rent a beeper.<BR>
In touch with nature<BR>
<P>

        On ecologically aware Sanibel Island, it follows that a good children's program would focus on the environment. An Environmental Coastal Observatory Center (ECO) is the crowning touch to Sundial Beach Resort's innovative, nature-oriented kids program.<P>

      Besides the typical crafts and games schedule, Sundial's longstanding tot programs revolve around its 12 tennis courts, shell beach and ECO Center, where a 180-gallon touch tank allows families to interact with live tulip shells, horseshoe crabs, sea stars and other creatures of the deep. <P>

        Discovery Club members -- children and adults -- wear environmental T-shirts, attend a shell symposium and can participate in a nature bike trek, environmental trivia and other educational sessions. <P>

      Kid's Night Out parties, with themes ranging from pirates to carnivals to the Wild West, are held on Saturdays. <P>

        Sun-Dial-A-Story helps put kids to bed with a two-minute bedtime tale accessible by telephone.<P>

Money and manners<BR>
<P>

        Young guests at Palm Beach's Breakers indulge in more than fun and games. Reflecting the high society atmosphere of Palm Beach, this age-old bastion of the privileged is known for its more serious minded, weeklong summer programs: Money Management Camp, Etiquette Camp and Culinary Camp.<P>

        Etiquette Camp teaches tomorrow's leaders ages 9 through 18 the social graces, with classes on self esteem and confidence building, meeting celebrities, telephone techniques, table manners and ballroom dancing.<P>

        At Money Management Camp, a stock broker familiarizes 12- to 18-year-olds with the intricacies of investing and budgeting. Participants actually invest $100 (included in the camp fee) after learning to read the The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones average.<P>

        At the Culinary Camp, Breakers Executive Chef Matthias Radits shows 12- to 18-year-olds how to prepare meals from hors d'oeuvres through dessert, using a hands-on approach.<P>

        Summer also brings nine weeks of Sports Camp with instruction in snorkeling, sailing, golf and tennis for kids in two age groups -- 6 to 8 and 9 to 12.<P>

Child-proof suites<BR>
<P>

        Child-proofed suites and a macaw named Lisa make the Radisson Suite Resort on Sand Key, Clearwater Beach, a favorite choice for both grown-ups and growing-ups.<P>

        The all-suite resort dedicated a floor to family suites, equipped with safety latches on the doors, a safety net on the balcony, child-proofed electrical outlets, a convertible crib-playpen and high chair. Strollers are available upon request.<P>

        Rad Tots (3 to 5) and Rad Kids (5 to 13) can participate in one hour of complimentary playtime (Rad as in Radisson, not radical). A choice of activities, such as crafts or bike rides, are offered in the afternoon.<P>

        Lisa, the talking macaw, entertains 4- to 12-year-olds at a Friday ice cream social, and is available for bedtime tuck-ins, photos and birthday parties. <P>

Goofy nights<BR>
<P>

       Walt Disney World's many resorts provide the ultimate in family vacationing. Besides allowing easy access to the different theme parks, they often put the mouse-ear crowd in live contact with their favorite cartoon characters via special meals and shows. <P>

        The Polynesian Resort, for example, endears children with its animatronic vignettes and other ``Goofy'' amenities. Minnie, Goofy, Pluto, Chip and Dale mingle with breakfast guests. They're back in the afternoon for show time, followed by on-stage hula lessons.<P>

        Then there's the fun food: Goofy's Gooey Grilled Cheese, Chip 'n Dale's Peanut Pocket Plus and Walk the Gangplank cocktail. <P>

        Parents can step out for the evening, leaving kids ages 3 to 12 at Never Land, a theme game room. Kids enter through Wendy's nursery and climb through a window into Never Land, where they play video games on a pirate ship, color inside a tepee, watch Disney videos among the clouds, and dine off the crocodile buffet. Goofy visits for photos, plus there are crafts and a live animal encounter.<P>

   Another family-friendly idea at Disney World resorts is the Surprise Early Entrance Plan. It sneaks guests into the theme park one hour ahead of the crowds. <P>
