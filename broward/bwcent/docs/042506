<m0>ary Ann Scannell greets customers with these words: ``If you can buy a $2,000 dress for $200, would you care if it was worn for four hours?''<ep>
   Scannell, owner of <m0>Somewhere in Time <m0>(--) ``The Ultimate Consignment Shop'' (--) in Plantation, has now opened a second location at 1840 NW 122nd Ter. in Pembroke Pines.<ep>
   ``It's a really good area. It's up and coming,'' said Scannell, who opened the second location six months ago. ``Business has been good. It's starting to catch on.''<ep>
   The stores feature the clothing of such designers as Valentino, Mondi, Escada and Bob Mackie, to name a few, well below their original cost. Scannell gets dressy, semi-dressy and antique clothes shipped from ``high society'' women all over the country, she said.<ep>
   ``I've been in retail for 25 years, and I know a lot of people,'' she said.<ep>
   Shoppers include the wealthy and the not-so-wealthy (--) whoever is looking for a bargain. It's not uncommon to see Rolls-Royces pull up in front of the store, Scannell said.<m1><ep>
<m0>   The new store is decorated like the old store, in a rich Victorian motif.<ep>
   Both stores are open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. The Plantation store is at 1834 N. University Dr. For information, call 450-7200 <m1> <m0>in Pembroke Pines or 476-0601 in Plantation.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>Sweet Tomatoes, <m0>a California chain of ``Salad Buffet and Bakery Restaurants,'' has opened a restaurant in Plantation (--) the first of several planned for South Florida.<ep>
   On Wednesday (--) its third day open (--) the restaurant was packed, said manager Wayne Drucker.<ep>
   ``We had 600 people for lunch,'' he said.<ep>
   The restaurant features a fresh pasta bar with a choice of two pastas and three sauces, salad bar, homemade soups and baked goods, pizza focaccia and a dessert buffet featuring nonfat frozen yogurt, toppings and fruit. Lunch and dinner are fixed price and all you can eat, and it's mostly self-service.<ep>
   The prices: $5.99 for lunch Monday through Friday, $6.99 for lunch Saturday and Sunday, and $7.19 for dinner all the time. Kids 12 and younger eat for $3.99, and kids younger than 5 eat free. Beverages cost extra, and beer and wine should be on the menu soon. Takeout is available.<ep>
   Another Sweet Tomatoes is scheduled to open at the Oakwood Plaza in Hollywood in the fall, and others are planned in Coral Springs and Fort Lauderdale next year. There are five Sweet Tomatoes in Tampa, as well as in Arizona and California.<ep>
   The Plantation Sweet Tomatoes is in The Fountains Shoppes of Distinction, 801 S. University Dr. It is open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday.<ep>
