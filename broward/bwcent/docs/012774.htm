fter transcribing minutes of Plantation City Council meetings for 20 years, the city has honored Isabelle Ellis with a resolution of appreciation.<P>

   The 68-year-old mother of three and grandmother of two retired May 1 after 25 years of work for the city.<P>

   ``I've been working for many, many years,'' she said. ``It just seemed like it was time to go on to new adventures.''<P>

   Before she began transcribing minutes of the the weekly meetings, Ellis was the secretary for Plantation's director of utilities. Now, she wants to spend time with her family, take classes and perhaps volunteer in a nursing home.<P>

   ``She always has a smile and a hug,'' said license clerk Mary Carroll, who worked with Ellis for 20 years. ``I've never met a person who didn't like her.''<BR>
  Denni Eisen of Cooper City has been named South Florida representative for three New York State summer camps. Eisen, who has worked for Pine Forest, Lake Owego and Timber Tops camps since January, now recruits campers from the South Florida area.<P>

   She also will oversee 150 children and staff members at Pine Forest this summer. Eisen's two children, Michael, 7, and Jackie, 10, will be first-timers at the camp.<P>

   ``The self-esteem and self-confidence they get at camp lasts with them a lifetime,'' said Eisen, who went to a North Carolina summer camp for 13 years. ``It really teaches them how to be part of a team and also be responsible for themselves.''<BR>
   After 17 years in the nursing field, Nancy Zanotti of Plantation was one of 41 recent inductees into Florida Atlantic University's Iota Xi Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing.<P>

   Zanotti, 47, is director of infection control and employee health at Columbia Westside and Columbia Plantation hospitals. She received her undergraduate degree in nursing four years ago from Florida International University and recently got her master's degree in public health from FIU.<P>

   Zanotti, who has two daughters, Lisa, 31, and Melanie, 24, said she's proud to be a member of Sigma Theta Tau, which has chapters at more than 390 colleges and universities in the United States, Canada, Taiwan, South Korea and Australia.<P>

   ``They really acknowledge the importance of education and research,'' she said.<BR>
   <LI> Navy Seaman Recruit Scott D. Spallinger, son of David and Kanden S. Spallinger of Plantation, recently completed eight weeks of U.S. Navy basic training. Spallinger, who graduated from South Plantation High School in 1995, was trained in everything from first aid to firefighting at Recruit Training Command in Great Lakes, Ill.<P>

   <LI> Marine Pfc. Peter Svoboda, son of Vladimir Svoboda of Sunrise, recently completed basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Parris Island, S.C. He is a 1995 graduate of J.P. Taravella High School in Coral Springs.
