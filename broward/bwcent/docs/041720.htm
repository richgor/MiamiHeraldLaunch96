ere's the latest on LaCosta: The original developer is in bankruptcy proceedings. The second developer says he'll finish the project as soon as he gets the bankruptcy court's OK. And the third developer says he'll be the one to finish the half-built neighborhood.<P>

   Soon, there will be two competing homeowners' associations, too.<P>

   Confused?<P>

   There are more plots, rumors and counterplots in LaCosta than there are homes.<P>

   For a year, the subdivision at the corner of Weston Road and Blatt Boulevard has been half-completed. Planned as 70 homes, it's only 70 with other houses half built and about a dozen vacant lots. LaCosta is a battleground of competing claims over who will finish it, who owns what and when the situation will be resolved.<P>

   What's happening now:<P>

   <LI>Work that began again last week on the neighborhood's outside wall. That's being done by Coastal Construction Consultants of North Miami, a firm headed by Don Green, who has promised to finish LaCosta.<P>

   Green is the third developer to show up at LaCosta. The second was Construction Consultants of Bonaventure, controlled by Arnold DiGregorio. The original was Treasured Spaces of Florida, controlled by the Glusman family. Treasured Spaces built about 30 houses, then abandoned LaCosta in March 1995.<P>

   <LI> Green, who says he owns four homes, is in the process of pulling permits to finish work on those houses.<P>

   <LI> Green said he has bought the mortgage rights to 14 other homes that were scheduled to be sold at a foreclosure auction April 23 by lender First Union.<P>

   <LI> Just one day before the auction, the sale was delayed indefinitely because Treasured Spaces of Florida filed for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection. That gives the company a chance to reorganize and develop a plan to repay its debts. Green says he plans to challenge the bankruptcy filing in court.<P>

   <LI> DiGregorio, who made the bankruptcy filing for Treasured Spaces, says he will finish LaCosta and that he, not Green, owns the 14 houses. He said he wants to start work as soon as he gets court permission, possibly at a bankruptcy hearing June 6.<P>

  <LI> DiGregorio says he has contracts to sell six houses that he owns there. He plans to give buyers credit for their deposits and sell the homes at the original asking price. He also said he plans to form a new homeowners association, to replace the voluntary group that exists there now.<P>

   <LI> Green has said he will buy all the half-built homes and vacant lots and bring the subdivision up to its original plan of 70 homes in a well landscaped neighborhood. He too plans to sell some houses at the original price but some homeowners say they would lose their deposits.<P>

   But some homebuyers complain that he wants them to forfeit their deposits and they object to his strongly worded letters. Others note that DiGregorio is on probation for a federal mail fraud conviction in New York. DiGregorio's response, ``What does that have to do with Bonaventure?''<P>

   Want to hear more? The Homeowners Association at LaCosta, the voluntary group that formed last year to get streetlights turned on, plans to meet with Don Green at 7:30 p.m. May 15 at the Bonaventure Town Center Club, 16690 Saddle Club Rd., Bonaventure.
