<m0>lantation has long been known for its lush landscaping, so for Arbor Day the city gave credit where credit was due (--) to the business owners and residents who do their best to keep things green.<ep>
   The city's PLANT awards (--) Plantation Landscape Awards for Nurturing our Town (--) have been around for 13 years and there were 13 winners this time. Don't let it be said that's an unlucky number.<ep>
   Plantation Shell at 7901 W. Broward Blvd. won the award for small commercial establishments of 10,000 square feet or less for the third time in four years.<ep>
   ``It's an image that Shell likes to uphold, and the city of Plantation recognizes that we do such a good job on the plants and the landscaping,'' said John Pascal, the station's manager.<ep>
   Four judges checked out the 36 entries in the contest and chose the 13 winners on the basis of design, how the plants mix with each other and how well it's all maintained.<ep>
   Impatiens were the winter flower of choice among some of the PLANT award winners. The Shell station is changing over to marigolds and other summer flowers at the moment, Pascal said.<ep>
   The French Quarter condominiums at 70th Avenue and Broward Boulevard won for multifamily dwellings greater than 51 units and older than 10 years.<ep>
   ``They probably put out more trees than most people do,'' property manager and condo resident Tex Davis said of the city staff. ``I think the city worries about that. We love it.''<ep>
   The French Quarter's landscape maintenance man comes twice a month to cut grass, trim trees and plant flowers, Davis said.<ep>
   ``It's nice to see all the trees,'' he said. ``We need 'em.''<ql>
