lantation Athletic League youth tackle football has changed affiliation from the National Boys' Football League to the new American Youth Football League. The new league consists of Cooper City, Pasadena Lakes, Plantation, Sawgrass, Weston and Boca Raton.<P>

   ``We had three weight divisions in the old league [95s, 122s, 148s],'' PAL tackle football commissioner Laney Stearns said. ``In the new league, there are seven weight divisions. That means we can accommodate 100 more kids than last year. We had to turn kids away last year. Do you know what it's like to cut a 12-year-old? I don't want to ever have to do that again.''<P>

   Last year, PAL tackle football attracted about 250 players, but had to cut 100 applicants. This season, PAL tackle football has room for 245 players.<P>

   ``We want to get the word out that our program has expanded and we can handle 100 more children than last year,'' Stearns said.<P>

   Plantation Athletic League tackle football and cheerleading program is conducting registration from 6 to 9 p.m. Friday and from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at Plantation Community Center, 5555 Palm Tree Rd.<P>

   The league is open to players and cheerleaders, age 8 to 15. The age/weight group breakdown is: age 8-9, 75 pounds; age 10, 85 pounds; age 11, 95 pounds; age 12, 110 pounds; age 13, 125 pounds; age 14, 135 pounds; and age 15, 155 pounds.<P>

   Registration fee is $75. Players must bring a copy of their birth certificate. For more information, call Laney or Karen Stearns at 587-2518.<BR>

   The Plantation Central Park 55-and-older men's tennis team finished second in Division I in the Senior Men's Tennis League of Broward County. Team members received their trophies last month at the awards ceremony at Pine Island Ridge Country Club in Fort Lauderdale.<P>

   Plantation finished with a 43-17 record, just one game behind the Tennis Club of Fort Lauderdale, which usually runs away with the championship in this doubles-only league. Joe Cerato (11-0) and Skip Clements (14-0) led Plantation.<P>

   Dave Hoffman (11-1) and George Janica (11-2) also played well. Hoffman, an airline pilot, missed three cgnsecutive Thursday matches because of bad weather up North, which delayed flight plans. That changed the Plantation lineup, slowing the team's momentum.<P>

   Ray Walker (10-1) and Jim Holton (5-1) helped pick up the slack. Marvin Lazarowitz (7-3) and team captain Ed Jansen (7-5) performed admirably.<P>

   ``We're the first team to be competitive with Fort Lauderdale,'' Jansen said. ``We'll beat them next year.''<P>

   Plantation also consists of Chuck Kaufman, Hershall Lewis, Stan Meyers, Paul O'Brien and Ron Snodgrass.<BR>

<P>

   Bill Fanizzi, 32, of Fort Lauderdale is taking what he knows and using that to develop young baseball players.<P>

   Fanizzi, a former professional player, is a hitting instructor in Broward County, teaching players age 7 to 23 the proper mechanics and techniques of hitting. He is already instructing 40 youths throughout Broward.<P>

   ``The students are getting such good results,'' Fanizzi said. ``Literally, the parents call me at 10 and 11 at night after games about the progress their kids are making. That's what's most satisfying. I enjoy working with the youngsters.''<P>

   A 1981 Fort Lauderdale High School graduate, Fanizzi played at the College of Boca Raton -- now named Lynn University -- leading the team in hitting in 1985. This former Herald All-County first-team selection later played for the Miami Marlins, an independent minor league team, and the Brainerd Bears, another independent team in Minnesota.<P>

   Fanizzi, an outfielder, spent two seasons in the Italian League. Last season he competed for the Omaha Royals, the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals.<P>

   For more information, call 777-3975.
