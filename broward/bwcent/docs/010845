<m0>he developer wants to build homes.<ep>
   The town of Davie wants to end a lawsuit.<ep>
   And Davie residents only want low-density homes built around them.<ep>
   Former Town Administrator Irving Rosenbaum stepped up to the council podium Wednesday with a proposal to accomplish all three of those goals for the Belmont Lakes community in western Davie.<ep>
   Rosenbaum's suggestion to create a community development district appealed to council members, especially after the landowner offered to drop the pending lawsuit against the town. Council members unanimously agreed to halt litigation and consider a new development district in Davie.<ep>
   ``This sounds like a really fine settlement,'' Mayor Harry Venis said.<ep>
   In September, council members rejected a developer's proposal to rezone the 50-acre parcel in western Davie. In October, the landowner, SunBank of Ocala, filed a lawsuit in Broward Circuit Court appealing the decision against estate zoning, which would have allowed it to build homes on lots smaller than one acre.<ep>
   The property, near Southwest 14th Street and Shotgun Road, borders Davie's Oak Hills and D&M Acres, where the majority of residents own animals.<ep>
   ``A lot of developers try to get density increases because it's not always economically feasible to build the one-acre lots in the country-style manner,'' Rosenbaum said. ``This kind of district allows Davie to maintain its rural character.''<ep>
   The landowner could then afford to build homes on one-acre lots. By creating a district, it would allow the landowner to borrow money from a bank to build the infrastructure (--) water and sewer fixtures (--) and the residents would pay the principal and interest through fixed assessment fees.<ep>
   ``The town would be under no financial obligation and the homeowners are protected,'' said Rosenbaum, a municipal consultant and director of the Center for Entrepreneurship for Nova Southeastern University. ``Everyone walks away with what they want.''<ql>
