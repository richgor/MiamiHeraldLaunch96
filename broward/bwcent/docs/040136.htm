lthough Wednesday's City Council meeting brought the Schacknow Auditorium one step closer to construction, Plantation residents aren't finished sounding off about the $1.8 million building.<P>

   The council approved a roof design for the auditorium one week after sending architect Edd Weiner back to the drawing board to address members' concerns about potential leaks.<P>

   The new roof, which will have two peaks 35 and 42 feet high, has fewer seams and a steeper incline to shed rain more quickly. Weiner will address the council again Wednesday with estimates on the new, costlier design.<P>

   ``I think this roof line is going to marry with the community a lot more graciously than the other roof line,'' council member Rae Carole Armstrong said.<P>

   Council members hope to finalize the plans and seek construction bids in six to eight weeks.<BR>
Is it too big?<P>

   Although the roof problem was settled, concerns about the building's size remained. When Council President Ron Jacobs said, ``Some residents in [Plantation] Acres have commented the building is too big,'' he was met with a smattering of applause.<P>

   Council members tried to ease residents' fears about the 22,000-square-foot auditorium, to be built on the southwest corner of Sunrise Boulevard and Northwest 118th Avenue.<P>

   ``Twenty-two thousand square feet is half an acre out of a 50-acre site. That is not a huge footprint,'' Armstrong said. <BR>
Benefactor threatens to move project<P>

   Tensions between council members and Max Schacknow, who is donating $500,000 toward construction of the 600-seat auditorium, were evident. Schacknow threatened to move his project if the council didn't speed up the building process.<P>

   ``I've had nothing but heartache,'' Schacknow told the council. ``If this place is not finished by Nov. 30, then Coral Springs is going to be a half million dollars richer.''<P>

   Jacobs said, ``We cannot have the city go into a multimillion-dollar project and rush it because we're afraid of losing half a million dollars.''<P>

   Steve Eisenberg, chairman of the Plantation Acres Improvement District, warned the council not to be swayed by Schacknow's ultimatum.<P>

   ``I don't know if you'll be able to exercise your best judgment with constant threats,'' he said. ``I'd hate to see the city stuck with a white elephant that we'll all have to pay for long after Mr. Schacknow moves on.''
