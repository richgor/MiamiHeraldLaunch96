<m0>etective Craig Lupo makes a living by sending crooks to jail. But you won't find him running after crooks or following lawbreakers on high-speed chases (--) at least, not most of the time.<ep>
   The Cooper City police detective investigates elderly exploitation and child sexual abuse cases. Lupo listens to the horror stories. Then, he sets off to find the culprit.<ep>
   ``It's a paper chase,'' Lupo said. ``I spend some days following leads and typing supplemental reports.''<ep>
   Lupo, 34, grew up in Hollywood and graduated from South Broward High School. After high school, he joined the Marine Corps, where he served for four years.<ep>
<m1>Hopes for promotion<ep>
<m0>   In 1989, he went to the police academy and joined the Cooper City department, where he worked as a patrol officer. Three years later, he was promoted to the detective bureau. Recently, he passed a police sergeant's exam and hopes to be promoted when a sergeant position is available.<ep>
   Lupo and detective Tom Hewlett earlier this year spent months investigating a case where a 15-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped after her drink was spiked with sleeping pills known as roofies.<ep>
   The youths slipped white dime-size pills called Rohypnol (--) prescribed as sleeping pills in about 80 countries (--) and waited for them to take effect, police said. When the girl dozed off, the three youths took turns raping her numerous times, police said.<ep>
   ``We started getting information from kids at school that the drug was being used and we started investigating,'' Lupo said. ``Then we got a phone call from a victim who wanted to tell us what happened.''<ql>
<m1>Arrest is made<ep>
<m0>   After months of interviews and meetings with the Broward State Attorney's Office, an arrest was made.<ep>
   Brothers Scott Harmon, 17, and Sidney Harmon, 19, both of Pembroke Pines, and Moises Ventura, 18, of Miramar, were arrested on Feb. 1 and charged with numerous counts of sexual battery. The youths were taken to the Broward County Jail and later released on bail.<ep>
   ``These cases are difficult because there is so much fear,'' Lupo said. ``The victims and witnesses are afraid and the bad guys are usually spreading fear, too.''<ep>
   Lupo says victims need to trust the police and can't blame themselves for what happened.<ep>
   ``Even if they make a mistake, the kids need to know that no one has a right to violate them,'' Lupo said. <ep>
