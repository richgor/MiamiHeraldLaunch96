<m0>   Free work pays off. The Indian Trace Community Development District Board of Supervisors last week decided to hire a new bond counsel, if all the details work out. The firm would be Ruden, McCloskey Smith, Schuster & Russell, which has been working for free for the district since last summer.<ep>
   Under an unusual arrangement, Ruden McCloskey has helped the district through the process of preparing a Weston incorporation proposal. If Weston voters decide to create the new city, Ruden McCloskey plans to submit a bill to the new government, but the city is not obligated to pay it.<ep>
   Indian Trace needs a bond counsel because it plans to float $40 million in bonds later this year to finance development of the final phase of Weston, the area known as Increment III.<ql>
