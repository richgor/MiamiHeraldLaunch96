<B><FONT SIZE=+3>O</FONT></B>ver the next few weeks, Hometown Herald will be introducing readers to some of the new principals assigned to West Broward elementary, middle and high schools. The new faces are part of the 28 principal reassignments voted on recently by the Broward School Board. Recommended by Superintendent Frank Petruzielo, the reassignments are part of Petruzielo's philosophy that no principal should serve longer than five years at any one school.<P>

   Here is one of the new principals:<P>

<LI> Name: Marcia Pann<P>

<LI> Age: 53<P>

<LI> New assignment: Pioneer Middle School, 5350 SW 90th Ave., Cooper City<P>

<LI> Birthplace: Brooklyn, N.Y.<P>

<LI> Family: Married, two children, two stepchildren.<P>

<LI> Career: First taught third-graders in East Meadow, N.Y. Her first teaching position in Florida was at Fairway Elementary in 1975. There, she taught several grades and worked as a guidance counselor. After a stint as guidance counselor at Palmview Elementary, Pann became assistant administrator at Ramblewood Elementary. She took over as principal at Floranada Elementary in January 1983 before moving to Silver Ridge Elementary in November 1988.<P>

<LI> Education: Bachelor's degree in education and master's in guidance and counseling, both from Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. In 1980, she earned an educational specialist degree from Nova University -- now Nova Southeastern -- in administration and supervision.<P>

<LI> Subjects she has taught: Preschool, most elementary grades and special-education classes.<P>

<LI> Reasons for becoming an educator: ``I felt that was the best way to help children and to help the future of our country. I think teachers really touch children's lives. . . . I don't think I've ever spoken to anyone who doesn't remember a teacher who's had a significant impact on their lives.''<P>

<LI> Philosophy on education: ``I believe that students deserve to receive the best education available, and I believe that a school's job is to provide that for them. . . . With that, we empower children to strive for the best.''<BR>
-- JACQUELINE CHARLES<BR>
<P>

Here's a list of the new principals in Plantation and Davie. Hometown Herald will profile them in the upcoming weeks.<P>

  <LI> Seminole Middle: James Bedell from Rogers Middle <P>

  <LI> Western: Bruce Wagar from Coral Springs High
