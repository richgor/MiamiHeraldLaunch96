<m0>estern Davie residents were outraged to learn that 15 acres in their rural neighborhood had been proposed as a site for a new homeless shelter in Broward.<ep>
   ``I don't think western Davie is the appropriate place for a homeless shelter,'' said Debbie Apolinario, one of several area residents who are writing letters in protest. ``My kids roam the streets freely and I don't have to worry. I don't want my kids outside playing if there is a homeless shelter down the street.''<ep>
   The site, owned by Fred M. Carr, will be evaluated May 21 by a committee of the Homeless Initiative Partnership (--) an advisory board to the County Commission (--) which will recommend a site to the commission later this month. The committee also will evaluate three other proposals from private land owners.<ep>
   Roberto Hernandez, assistant to the director in the Broward County Human Services Department, said it is unlikely that the committee will choose the Davie site because of its remote location at the corner of Southwest 136th Avenue and 37th Court. But the site cannot be ruled out, he said.<ep>
   ``This is the same piece of land that was up for consideration last year and it didn't even make the top five,'' Hernandez said. ``Last year, the sitting committee decided it was too far out west and too removed from the homeless population.''<ep>
   Last week, the county received three proposals for shelter sites, in addition to the Davie location:<ep>
   (box) A five-acre tract at 2015 NW Third Ave., Pompano Beach; asking price: $700,000.<ep>
   (box) A five-acre tract on the northwest corner of 24th Avenue and McClellan Street in Hollywood; asking price: $650,000.<ep>
   (box) A 5.88-acre tract on the northeast corner of Sample and Powerline roads near Pompano Beach; asking price: $1.8 million.<ep>
   The proposals will be discussed at a public meeting at 3 p.m. May 21 at the Broward County Governmental Center, 115 S. Andrews Ave. in Fort Lauderdale.<ql>
