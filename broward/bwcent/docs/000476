<m0>oy MacDonald,<m0> 55, of Fort Lauderdale set a world record in the pole vault in the women's 55-to-59 age group last month at the sixth Naples on the Gulf Masters Track & Field Meet.<ep>
   MacDonald, a novice, scaled 8 feet 3 inches for the record.<ep>
   ``This was my first outdoor meet of the season, so I'm hoping to do a lot better than this,'' said MacDonald, a sprinter who converted to pole vault two years ago. ``I want to hit 10 feet this year, and I know I can do that.''<ep>
   She attributes her pole-vaulting success to Cardinal Gibbons High School track and field coach <m0>Glenn Lee, <m0>pole vault official <m0>Don Manchester, <m0>St. Thomas Aquinas track and field coach <m0>Dave Sheppard, <m0>and Hollywood YMCA gymnastics coach <m0>Roberto Pumpido.<m0><ep>
   ``I used gymnastics for upper body strength, the flexibility, the balance and body awareness,'' MacDonald said. ``Overall fitness.''<m1><ep>
<m0>   MacDonald's personal best is 8 feet, 8 1/4 inches, set last July at the National Masters Championships in East Lansing, Mich. She competed in the women's 50-54 age group last year, winning the national title. She won silver at the World Games in Buffalo.<ep>
   ``The quarter mile is the hardest event,'' said MacDonald, who won a master's national title in the quarter mile in the 45-49 age group seven years ago. ``But the pole vault is the most complicated. I still have years to go before I peak.''<ep>
   Age is not a factor. There are several pole vaulters from other countries 70 and older, along with two American female pole vaulters over 70.<ep>
   ``It's all in your head,'' MacDonald said.<ep>
   MacDonald, a distance runner earlier in her career, is a member of the Atlanta Track Club's masters team. When she's not on the track and field, she's a self-employed tax accountant for businesses and individuals throughout Broward.<ql>
<m0>Karate kudos<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  <m0>Danny Graham, <m0>10, of Fort Lauderdale was first in fighting and second in forms in the 10-year-old Intermediate Division at the Battle of Atlanta Karate Championships last month. Graham was the lone representative from Plantation's University Karate Center.<ep>
   ``For a 10-year-old to be able to travel far from home to compete without the immediate support of his coach and teammates and turn in a first-class performance in two events indicates an extraordinary level of self-confidence and emotional strength,'' said <m0>Robert Heale Mason, <m0>chief instructor at University Karate Center. ``While it may not have been Olympic gold for Danny, his victory at this event demonstrates a standard of excellence and commitment to performance that exemplifies the Olympic spirit.''<ep>
   The Battle of Atlanta is considered a top international martial arts tournament, drawing more than 2,000 competitors worldwide.<ql>
<m0>Summer sports programs<ql>
