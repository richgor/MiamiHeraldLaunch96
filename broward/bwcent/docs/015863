<m0>he Plantation City Council wrapped up discussions on repackaging city garbage bags Wednesday, voting to shift to smaller packages and larger bags.<ep>
   Instead of 18 blue garbage bags and four small recycling bags in every package, residents will soon be able to buy packages with 10 blue bags and three large recycling bags.<ep>
   The current packages cost $29.20; the new packages will cost $16.45.<ep>
   The change was prompted by the complaints of residents who said they wanted to buy fewer bags at a time. Others said they needed larger recycling bags.<ep>
   In another change, the bags will no longer be sold in cardboard boxes. People were lifting the boxes' flaps and taking out one or two bags in the supermarket. Now, the bags will be packaged in clear, tamper-resistant plastic.<ep>
   Small and large recycling bags still can be purchased separately at supermarkets.<ep>
<m1>Recycling reminders<ep>
