emember the good old days when the senior prom was in the school gymnasium, graduation invitations were sent by word of mouth, and the senior trip was a picnic at the local park?<P>

   Well, senior year ain't what it used to be -- cheap.<P>

   Gymnasiums have since been replaced by lavish hotels. Word-of-mouth invitations are now commencement announcements printed up on fancy stationery. And the senior trip to the park is Grad Nite, a visit with Mickey and Minnie at Walt Disney World.<P>

   What used to cost less than $100 today can easily cost $1,000.<P>

   ``It is a lot of money,'' said Wendy Ippolito, one of two senior advisers at Hallandale High, 720 NW Ninth Ave. ``We tell the kids at the end of their junior year to take a job this summer. Do whatever you can to save up money because senior year is very expensive.''<P>

  Despite sticking to such advice, many seniors -- and their parents -- are shocked at the costs that pile up during the final half of the school year. By that time, they've already dished out an average of $300 on class rings, $80 on homecoming tickets and anywhere from $50 to $200 on college applications.<P>

   ``Even though most of my friends have taken on jobs, they are still stressing out,'' said Hallandale senior Khea Davis. ``It's hard parting with that hard-earned money.''<P>

   Unlike her friends, Khea, 18, has been lucky. Her senior pictures ($300), prom dress ($200), three-piece Grad Nite outfit ($70), cap and gown ($21) and senior T-shirt ($10) were all paid for by Mom.<P>

   ``Of course senior year isn't going to be cheap, but I keep comparing everything to what my older sister paid four years ago and I definitely feel like I am making out better than her,'' Khea said.<P>

   When Miramar High School senior Kris Southall thinks about all he's spent so far, well, it's enough to make him sick.<P>

   ``Sometimes I don't even want to get paid,'' said Kris, 18, who works 15 hours a week after school at an electrical wholesale company. ``Every time I get paid I have to pay for something. Sometimes all I have is $20 in my pocket to take me through the whole week.''<P>

   How much has he spent so far?<P>

   ``I don't know exactly how much, but it's been close to $800,'' said Kris, whose graduation announcements alone cost $200.<P>

   Like many high school seniors, Kris and his friends have decided to go all-out for the prom. In addition to the $100 he spent on tickets for him and his girlfriend, Kris is renting a black and white tuxedo for $100 and a 1995 Honda Passport for $62 a day. After the prom, he and 20 of his closest friends are heading for the Bahamas on a cruise. The tickets, $50 a pop, were a group discount, he said.<P>

   ``Prom is going to be a fun weekend,'' Kris said. ``It's one of the only things I have looked forward to all year.''<P>

   But not every student goes all-out during senior year. Those who don't can get away with spending a relatively small amount of money, said Plantation High Assistant Principal Pete Tingam.<P>

    William Heller, an assistant principal at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic School in Fort Lauderdale, said the final decision on how much is spent on graduation rests with students.<P>

   ``A lot of it is self-decided costs,'' he said. ``There is no one who says you have to have a limousine for prom or all of the graduation parties that follow.''
