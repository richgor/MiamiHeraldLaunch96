lmost a year after they approved the construction of the 600-seat Schacknow Auditorium, not a shovel of earth has been turned, and Plantation City Council members are still sweating the details.<P>

   The auditorium's roof was at the center of an hourlong discussion at Wednesday's meeting, when architect Edd Weiner presented the council with a redesigned model of the building.<P>

   ``If there's one thing we don't want, it's a building that leaks,'' Mayor Frank Veltri told Weiner.<P>

   Weiner showed the council a three-dimensional model of the building, to be constructed on the southwest corner of Sunrise Boulevard and Northwest 118th Avenue. The multiangled, multitiered roof concerned council members, who feared that the numerous seams would lead to leakage.<P>

   Their fears were prompted, in part, by memories of another slippery roof situation. The Plantation Acres Fire Station, also designed by Wiener, had a similar roof design, said council member Ralph Merritt.<P>

   ``We had all kinds of difficulties with it,'' Merritt said. ``We have said from day one that we don't even want to have a chance of this building leaking.''<P>

   The council asked Weiner to redesign the roof, making it a single, continuous surface, instead of several overlapping levels.<P>

   The redesign and the materials needed to give the building a continuous roof will raise the cost of the project, Weiner told the council. He said he could not immediately estimate the amount.<P>

   He plans to present a new proposal at Wednesday's meeting.<P>

   Though the roof was the focal point of the discussion -- which was not on the council's formal agenda -- other concerns about the auditorium remain.<P>

   ``The community is tired of the size of this building,'' Lee Hillier, president of the Plantation Acres Homeowners Association, told the council. ``We're going to be the dumping ground for all kinds of social activities.''<P>

   The community has said a 14,000-square-foot building is the largest it can tolerate, Hillier said. At Wednesday's meeting, estimates of the auditorium's size ranged from 19,000 to 21,000 square feet.<P>

   ``It just shows the callous disregard of the city for our neighborhood,'' he said. ``The city is ramming this down our throat.''<P>

   Council members believe the auditorium, which is being designed to accommodate such community-oriented pursuits as square dancing and horseback riding, will be a pleasant surprise for most residents.<P>

   ``This community will use that building as much as -- or more than -- any other group,'' Merritt said.<P>

   But Hillier said the city has left residents in the dark by talking informally about the project when it is not on the published agenda.<P>

   ``You're not sensitive to our needs,'' he told council members. ``I think our community has showed great restraint in working with the city. But our patience is running thin.''
