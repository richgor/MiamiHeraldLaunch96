hilip Hersh is always in character, especially if it's for a good cause.<P>

   Weekdays he is PruBear the gravelly voiced mascot of Prudential HealthCare appearing at schools, day-care centers and hospitals, preaching health awareness to children.<P>

   Weekends he is Sam Bucca, a feisty tough-talking Italian in a local play. Or you may know Hersh as the tacky tourist, the nerd, an ape or your favorite TV character.<P>

   Impressions just come naturally to the amateur comedian, but he never expected his local acts would lead to the Olympics. Hersh, who has used his comic skills to entertain at countless local charity events, is one of 50 Broward residents selected to carry the Olympic torch across South Florida this summer.<P>

It's recognition<P>

   United Way chose Olympic torchbearers as a way to recognize outstanding volunteers. The 27-year-old entertainer, who works full time as PruBear, was nominated by a friend who didn't tell him about submitting his name to a panel until the selection process was over.<P>

   Hersh already participated in a recognition ceremony at Joe Robbie Stadium and will carry the torch along a quarter-mile route somewhere between Bayfront Park in Miami and Palm Beach County on July 4.<P>

   ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said Hersh. ``How often does something like this arrive?''<P>

   Hersh, of Dania, has a busy schedule juggling extracurricular appearances as PruBear at charity events across the county.<P>

Volunteers at shelters<P>

   He also volunteers at a handful of area shelters. Recently he could be found painting dormitories at the Lippman Shelter for abused and neglected children. During a break, he donned his PruBear costume and entertained children who accompanied the adult volunteers for the daylong event.<P>

   ``To entertain people, that's my job in life,'' said Hersh. ``I guess you could say I have found my niche. It's so rewarding to see a smile on someone's face.''<P>

   Later this month, he will be arrested for a Jail and Bail program benefiting the American Cancer Society.<P>

`Star volunteer'<P>

   ``He's our star volunteer,'' said Erina Morgan, director of public relations for Prudential HealthCare. ``He's always taking on additional events.''<P>

   For years, Hersh volunteered at Broward House, an assisted living facility for men and women with AIDS. He served as the group's driver, worked at garage sales and booths for the nonprofit organization.<P>

   He also entertained residents as PruBear once mimicking a dog, the house mascot, with such skill even the sickest residents began laughing, said Maxine Lemarr, volunteer coordinator of Broward House.<P>

   ``He had the whole place in stitches,'' said Lemarr. ``He was a really fun volunteer.''<P>

Began in high school<P>

   Hersh began volunteering in the private Mesivtah High School in Miami Beach when he enrolled in a program visiting area nursing homes. He has continued volunteering -- he even signed up for an army program while in Israel. It included completing a six-week basic training course and kitchen and sewing duties.<P>

   When he returned to Florida, he became involved in a variety of organizations, enrolling in activities with the American Cancer Society, Broward House, Meals on Wheels, Kids in Distress and the Don Shula Foundation.<P>

   ``It's so rewarding to give back to the community,'' said Hersh. ``I do what I can. I try to give 10 percent of my earnings to an organization [every year]. It's something I've been doing a long time.''
