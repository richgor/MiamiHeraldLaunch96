<m0>he <m0>Indian Trace Community Development <m0>District Board of Supervisors will take up the issue of blasting at its 7:30 p.m. meeting Monday at the Weston Hills Country Club, 2600 Country Club Way, Weston. A recent Herald investigation found 33 excessive blasts had taken place in Weston over the last five years. Countywide, The Herald documented 106 blasts that exceeded county or city limits on explosions.<ep>
   The Indian Trace board, which has its own blasting rules and complaint procedure, asked its staff and consultant GeoSonics to review their records on each of the 33 excessive blasts. At issue is what was documented and what records were given to the board or its staff. That report will be presented by Jeffrey Straw of GeoSonics.<ep>
   The board's agenda also calls for a discussion of the Indian Trace blasting claim procedure and blasting complaint committee.<ep>
    Also on the agenda is a discussion of hiring a bond counsel to handle the board's next bond issue. That will be a $40 million issue for the development of Weston's final phase, known as Increment III. A date for the issue to be sold has not been set.<ep>
    The firm suggested by Indian Trace's staff is Ruden, McClosky, Smith, Schuster & Russell. Ruden McClosky has worked at no charge for the Indian Trace board on its efforts to incorporate Weston.<ep>
   If a city is formed, the law firm then plans to submit a bill to the new city government. But the city does not have to pay it. Under an unusual agreement McClosky made with the Indian Trace board last summer, the firm will have to accept whatever payment (--) possibly none at all (--) the potential city may decide to make.<ql>
