<B><FONT SIZE=+3></FONT></B>he Sunrise Jewish Center will hold its first-ever intergenerational family service at 7:30 p.m. Friday in the Conservative synagogue at 4099 Pine Island Rd. in Sunrise.<P>

  The service is the idea of Cantor Joseph Wichelewski. Its purpose is to unite all members of the congregation, he said.<P>

  ``What makes the service unique is that young people will be taking an active role,'' Wichelewski said. ``The preschool and religious school students have prepared several songs for the occasion.''<P>

  A special book will also be used during the ceremony. The Hebrew prayers are spelled out phonetically with English letters so that people who don't know the language can participate, he said.<P>

  If Friday's service is successful, the congregation will host the ceremony once a month, he said.<P>

  Call 741-0295 for more information. Office hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m Monday through Thursday; 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday; and 8 a.m. to noon Sunday.<BR>

Square dance, dinner<BR>
<P>

   A square dance and dinner will be at 6 p.m. May 18 at Plantation Presbyterian Church, 901 NW 70th Ave.<P>

  The event is held yearly. This is first time the dinner and dance will be held in the spring, said the Rev. David Massey, pastor.<P>

  ``Usually we hold it in January, but we had a scheduling conflict,'' he said.<P>

  Also at the church, the adult study group is focusing on 20 Hot Potatoes Christians Are Afraid to Touch  by Tony Campolo.<P>

  The book touches on contemporary issues facing adults, such as motherhood and careers outside the home, and what to do when kids are making bad decisions.<P>

  The free meetings are held at 9:30 a.m. Sundays. Services will follow at 11 a.m.<P>

  The barbecue and the study group are part of continuing efforts by the church to bring together families, he said.<P>

  ``More people are moving every day to Plantation,'' he said. ``We try to have fun activities that will attract new folks in the community.''<P>
