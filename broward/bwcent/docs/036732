<m0>he <m0>ATI Giants<m0> moved into first place in the <m0>Plantation Athletic League's <m0>T-ball Division (ages 5 and 6) with a victory over <m0>Rinker Concrete<m0> May 1.<ep>
   Trailing by five in their final at-bat, the Giants scored six runs with two outs. After the first two batters flew out, the Giants erupted with a miracle finish highlighted by <m0>Matt Munchick's <m0>double and <m0>Ryan Achin's<m0> game-winning two-run double.<ep>
   The Giants put a little distance between themselves and the second-place <m0>Oxford Group<m0> with a 25-15 victory over Oxford Group on May 4. <m0>Ben Doenig<m0> hit a grand slam, and <m0>Ryan Kopp<m0> drilled a two-run home run to ignite the Giants in another come-from-behind effort. Achin, Doenig, <m0>Curtis Miles<m0>, and <m0>Joe Santino<m0> made some strong defensive plays.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>Logan Thompson<m0> drove in <m0>Daniel Turner<m0> with the winning run as the <m0>Blue Jays<m0> edged the <m0>Tigers, <m0>9-8, in Coach Pitch May 2 at City Park. In their previous meeting, the Tigers defeated the Blue Jays by scoring the winning run in their final at-bat.<ep>
   Trailing 8-7 in the last inning May 2, Turner's RBI double-scored <m0>Alex Hoyos<m0> with the tying run, setting up Thompson's heroics. The <m0>Blue Jays'<m0> defense made some standout plays, highlighted by Hoyos, second baseman <m0>Mitchell Beckner<m0>, first baseman <m0>Tony Govin<m0>, shortstop <m0>Jimmy Hone, <m0>and third baseman <m0>Bobby Wetzel.<m0><ep>
   Outfielder <m0>Joshua Simmons <m0>shined for the Tigers, making three catches, including one sliding snag. He also hit a home run. Shortstop <m0>Mike Marhefka <m0>hit a home run, scored twice and played well defensively.<ep>
   The Tigers' <m0>Gabe Ingellis<m0> scored two runs. Outfielder <m0>Joey Cinquegrana,<m0> <m0>Jordan Huertas, <m0>first baseman <m0>Chris Ludwig, <m0>and second baseman <m0>Anthony Pegnataro<m0> performed admirably on the field.<ep>
   (box) <m0>Andrew Allwine, Sean Boudreaux <m0>and <m0>Jeremy Matos<m0> helped lead the <m0>Brewers<m0> over the <m0>Blue Jays<m0> in tee-ball. <m0>Trevor Johnstone<m0> hit a three-run home run for the Blue Jays, and <m0>Michael Farjardo<m0> belted two doubles. <m0>Nicholas Vargas<m0> added a double, and first baseman <m0>Cory Davidson<m0> had a solid game defensively.<ep>
   (box) <m0>Anthony Serrano<m0> scored the winning run on <m0>Jackie Brown's<m0> RBI hit to lift the <m0>Angels <m0>over the <m0>Twins, <m0>21-20. <m0>Adam Weiner<m0> had three doubles, and <m0>Josh Daneck <m0>provided some timely hitting.
