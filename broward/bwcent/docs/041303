<m0>he <m0>Sunrise Jewish Center <m0>will hold its first-ever intergenerational family service at 7:30 p.m. Friday in the Conservative synagogue at 4099 Pine Island Rd. in Sunrise.<ep>
  The service is the idea of Cantor <m0>Joseph Wichelewski. <m0>Its purpose is to unite all members of the congregation, he said.<ep>
  ``What makes the service unique is that young people will be taking an active role,'' Wichelewski said. ``The preschool and religious school students have prepared several songs for the occasion.''<ep>
  A special book will also be used during the ceremony. The Hebrew prayers are spelled out phonetically with English letters so that people who don't know the language can participate, he said.<ep>
  If Friday's service is successful, the congregation will host the ceremony once a month, he said.<ep>
  Call 741-0295 for more information. Office hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m <m1> <m0>Monday through Thursday; 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday; and 8 a.m. to noon Sunday.<ql>

  Also at the church, the adult study group is focusing on <m0>20 Hot Potatoes Christians Are Afraid to Touch<m0>  by <m0>Tony Campolo.<m0><ep>
