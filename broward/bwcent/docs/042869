<m0>n honor of National Drinking Water Week, the city of Plantation gave awards to students who illustrated posters about the importance of water.<ep>
   The citywide first-place winner was <m0>Heather Hoeffer, <m0>9, a fourth-grader at St. Gregory School. Her poster shows children fishing and hooking debris instead of fish, while overhead the sun and clouds are crying.<ep>
   ``They were asked to draw a poster depicting water conservation or the importance of keeping the water clean,'' said <m0>Hank Breitenkam, <m0>Plantation assistant director of utilities ``[Heather's] poster shows the true importance of protecting the planet.''<ep>
   Second prize went to <m0>Hunter Griffin, <m0>9, a third-grader at American Heritage School. Third-grader <m0>Dana Schwab, <m0>9, of the David Posnack Hebrew Day School, took third place. The winners received T-shirts bearing their illustrations.<ql>
<m0>Funds donated to museum, library<ep>
<m0>   The <m0>Plantation Woman's Club <m0>donated a total of $8,000 to the <m0>Plantation Historical Museum <m0>and the <m0>Helen B. Hoffman Plantation Library.<m0><ep>
   The club traditionally donates $1,000 annually to each of the organizations, but this year it raised the amount to $4,000 each, said club chairman <m0>Carol DeWolf.<m0><ep>
   Some of the extra money came from fund-raising efforts such as the annual antique show, held in February. The bulk, however, came from the President's Project, which enables the club's leader to donate $10,000 to any community improvement projects during her two-year stay in office.<m1><ql>
<m0>Honor society inductee<ep>
<m0>   <m0>Judy Galdencio <m0>of Plantation was among 151 people recently inducted into the new Millersville University of Pennsylvania Xi Chi Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing.<ep>
   Galdencio, 46, a disability case manager at Kemper National Services in Plantation, graduated from Millersville University in 1988 with a bachelor of science in nursing. She now works with workers' compensation patients, helping to get them back to work after they've suffered injuries.<ep>
   Galdencio has lived in Plantation almost six years with her husband, <m0>Timothy, <m0>46, and children <m0>Christian, <m0>23; <m0>Angela, <m0>21; <m0>Theresa, <m0>19; and <m0>Michael, <m0>18.<ep>
   She said she's thrilled to be a new member of the honor society, which was founded in 1922 and has 350 chapters worldwide.<m1><ep>
<m0>   ``All the people that are the `Who's Who' in nursing are members,'' she said. ``It's really a great honor to be included.''<ql>
