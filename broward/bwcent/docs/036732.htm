he ATI Giants moved into first place in the Plantation Athletic League's T-ball Division (ages 5 and 6) with a victory over Rinker Concrete May 1.<P>

   Trailing by five in their final at-bat, the Giants scored six runs with two outs. After the first two batters flew out, the Giants erupted with a miracle finish highlighted by Matt Munchick's double and Ryan Achin's game-winning two-run double.<P>

   The Giants put a little distance between themselves and the second-place Oxford Group with a 25-15 victory over Oxford Group on May 4. Ben Doenig hit a grand slam, and Ryan Kopp drilled a two-run home run to ignite the Giants in another come-from-behind effort. Achin, Doenig, Curtis Miles, and Joe Santino made some strong defensive plays.<BR>
Sunrise Little League<P>

   Logan Thompson drove in Daniel Turner with the winning run as the Blue Jays edged the Tigers, 9-8, in Coach Pitch May 2 at City Park. In their previous meeting, the Tigers defeated the Blue Jays by scoring the winning run in their final at-bat.<P>

   Trailing 8-7 in the last inning May 2, Turner's RBI double-scored Alex Hoyos with the tying run, setting up Thompson's heroics. The Blue Jays' defense made some standout plays, highlighted by Hoyos, second baseman Mitchell Beckner, first baseman Tony Govin, shortstop Jimmy Hone, and third baseman Bobby Wetzel.<P>

   Outfielder Joshua Simmons shined for the Tigers, making three catches, including one sliding snag. He also hit a home run. Shortstop Mike Marhefka hit a home run, scored twice and played well defensively.<P>

   The Tigers' Gabe Ingellis scored two runs. Outfielder Joey Cinquegrana, Jordan Huertas, first baseman Chris Ludwig, and second baseman Anthony Pegnataro performed admirably on the field.<P>

   <LI> Andrew Allwine, Sean Boudreaux and Jeremy Matos helped lead the Brewers over the Blue Jays in tee-ball. Trevor Johnstone hit a three-run home run for the Blue Jays, and Michael Farjardo belted two doubles. Nicholas Vargas added a double, and first baseman Cory Davidson had a solid game defensively.<P>

   <LI> Anthony Serrano scored the winning run on Jackie Brown's RBI hit to lift the Angels over the Twins, 21-20. Adam Weiner had three doubles, and Josh Daneck provided some timely hitting. Defensively, outfielder Jimmy Enriques gave his all.<BR>
Broward County Roller Hockey<P>

   Kelly West scored twice, and John Zona added two assists as the Weston Wildcats defeated the Tamarac Tom Cats, 6-4, in the 11-and-younger age group April 28. Tamarac scored first, but the Wildcats recorded the next five goals.<P>

   Bobby Sans played well in the third period, helping Weston halt a late Tamarac charge. Justin Zucchini was outstanding on defense.<BR>
