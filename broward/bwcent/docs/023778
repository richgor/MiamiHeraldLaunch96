<m0>stancia homeowners may soon find their neighborhood living up to its Spanish name for a peaceful stay. <ep>
   A group of residents of this western Pembroke Pines neighborhood has been frustrated by sounds coming from two water pumps that have rattled their homes day and night for the past eight months.<ep>
   David Adler, Estancia's developer, met with a group of 15 homeowners on Thursday night to let them know his company will soon move the noisy pumps, which drain a canal to water more than 300 neighborhood lawns.<ep>
   Pumps will be moved to a nature preserve area in the front of the community, directly across the street from where the pumps now stand. Adler says his company has applied for city structural permits to build an insulation box for the pumps and now must apply for a separate permit to move the pumps across the street. He did not say when the $37,000 project will be completed.<ep>
   Pump sounds bounce wildly off the 14 homes on Southwest 185th Way and Southwest 187th Avenue that line the community canal. Adler said insulating and moving the pumps should reduce the neighborhood noise level by about 80 percent. Estancia management will run the pumps between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. daily.<ep>
   Most residents, like Marsha Smith and her husband Joel Prince, moved to the neighborhood last summer. Neighbors claim they cannot open their windows. And most keep their doors closed, too. The sounds reverberate off the tile floors and sometimes shake windowpanes.<ep>
  ``We've lived our lives around these pumps for months. This is good news, this is wonderful news, we'll have our lives back, again,'' Smith said Thursday.<ep>
   By fall, the neighborhood is scheduled to have 419 homes and two more water pumps to water lawns.<ql>
