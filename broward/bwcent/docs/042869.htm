n honor of National Drinking Water Week, the city of Plantation gave awards to students who illustrated posters about the importance of water.<P>

   The citywide first-place winner was Heather Hoeffer, 9, a fourth-grader at St. Gregory School. Her poster shows children fishing and hooking debris instead of fish, while overhead the sun and clouds are crying.<P>

   ``They were asked to draw a poster depicting water conservation or the importance of keeping the water clean,'' said Hank Breitenkam, Plantation assistant director of utilities ``[Heather's] poster shows the true importance of protecting the planet.''<P>

   Second prize went to Hunter Griffin, 9, a third-grader at American Heritage School. Third-grader Dana Schwab, 9, of the David Posnack Hebrew Day School, took third place. The winners received T-shirts bearing their illustrations.<BR>
Funds donated to museum, library<P>

   The Plantation Woman's Club donated a total of $8,000 to the Plantation Historical Museum and the Helen B. Hoffman Plantation Library.<P>

   The club traditionally donates $1,000 annually to each of the organizations, but this year it raised the amount to $4,000 each, said club chairman Carol DeWolf.<P>

   Some of the extra money came from fund-raising efforts such as the annual antique show, held in February. The bulk, however, came from the President's Project, which enables the club's leader to donate $10,000 to any community improvement projects during her two-year stay in office.<BR>
Honor society inductee<P>

   Judy Galdencio of Plantation was among 151 people recently inducted into the new Millersville University of Pennsylvania Xi Chi Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing.<P>

   Galdencio, 46, a disability case manager at Kemper National Services in Plantation, graduated from Millersville University in 1988 with a bachelor of science in nursing. She now works with workers' compensation patients, helping to get them back to work after they've suffered injuries.<P>

   Galdencio has lived in Plantation almost six years with her husband, Timothy, 46, and children Christian, 23; Angela, 21; Theresa, 19; and Michael, 18.<P>

   She said she's thrilled to be a new member of the honor society, which was founded in 1922 and has 350 chapters worldwide.<P>

   ``All the people that are the `Who's Who' in nursing are members,'' she said. ``It's really a great honor to be included.''<BR>
Military notes<P>

   Navy Airman Lawrence R. Talley, son of Lawrence R. Talley of Plantation, recently reported for duty aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, whose home port is Norfolk, Va.
