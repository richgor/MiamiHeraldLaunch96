obert Dover, gripping the bridle of his horse, Metallic, is having a little trouble getting Metallic to stand still for a picture.<P>

   The horse, a gray Dutch warmblood standing 17 hands tall (5-foot-8 from hoof to shoulder), is having none of it. Standing close to tall hedges lining the stables at Romance Farms in Wellington in Palm Beach County, Metallic yanks his head up and down, side to side. He nuzzles Dover's shoulder.<P>

   ``Stand here! Here!'' Dover commands, adding, ``They don't like to be backed into bushes.''<P>

   If you knew Dover's reputation as one of the nation's elite dressage competitors -- and his background as a teenager growing up in Hollywood -- you'd find some irony in Dover's inability to keep Metallic motionless for a few seconds.<P>

   Because Dover, 39, the only three-time male Olympian in U.S. equestrian history, can make this horse do astounding things in competition.<P>

   He can make him skip. Prance. Run sideways. Change pace. Change stride. Trot in place (called a piaffe). Thrust his forelegs and back legs in opposite directions. All to music. With Dover astride, Metallic is malleable.<P>

   Dover will be trying for his fourth straight U.S. Olympic Team in June when Olympic Trials take place at U.S. Equestrian headquarters in Gladstone, N.J. He's a strong favorite to be riding Metallic, owned by Anne Gribbons of West Palm Beach, in the Atlanta Olympic Games.<P>

   Dressage has been around longer than most Olympic sports, debuting at the 1912 Games. It doesn't have the drama of show jumping. But watch closely and you can see remarkable things.<P>

   Dressage (from the French word dresser, to train) consists of putting a horse first through formal movements (similar to skating's compulsories), then a freestyle-type routine to music.<P>

   What it looks like is a horse dance. Riders dress the part, wearing a top hat and formal garb -- which seems to suit Dover perfectly.<P>

   Dover's parents, Herb and Jeanne, still live in Hollywood. Herb said that Robert, the youngest of four children, was the most self-disciplined. He never had to tell Robert to pick up his room. Never recalls telling him to get a haircut.<P>

   ``He's a stickler for meticulous cleanliness,'' Herb said, driving from the stables to his son's Wellington home, where Robert spends winter months training and teaching. Robert lives in Flemington, N.J., the rest of the year. ``That barn is cleaner than most homes.''<P>

   If his mother or father had to punish him, Robert -- even as a youngster of 6 or 7 -- usually beat them to it.<P>

   Said Robert: ``If I thought I had done something wrong, I'd put myself under my bed.''<P>

   That self-discipline served him well in his early training at Sunshine Ranches, where Dover first began to dream of competing in the Olympics. He started riding at age 11 when he tagged along with the daughter of his parents' friends.<P>

   ``From the time I was 15, I already had the feeling I could do it,'' Dover said. ``There's a certain kind of mentality that lends toward [dressage]. I was analytical and disciplined.''<P>

   The Dovers moved to Hollywood from the Bahamas in 1970. If you attended South Broward High School with Robert, you probably wouldn't have noticed.<P>

   ``I hardly spoke,'' Dover said. ``I was shy. I went to school, then went to the horses.''<P>

   Moving four times in childhood -- father Herb owned a company selling lights for trucks, then was a Realtor -- probably contributed to his shyness. But now, Dover is the center of attention in dressage circles.<P>

   In Europe, kids stand 80 deep to request autographs after he competes. He was named the U.S. Olympic Committee Equestrian athlete of the year in 1995 and was selected one of the 100 most influential equestrians in the nation. He won a bronze in the 1992 Olympics in team dressage.<P>

    But in the United States, he's barely recognized by the sporting public. That doesn't bother him much. Not seeing dressage grow would.<P>

   ``He's just trying to make it a little more appealing to the masses,'' said Violet Forbes, whose company publicizes the equestrian team. ``He was doing a freestyle to the music to Star Wars  while everyone was still puttering around to their Mozart. Now there are a few [riders] who do that.''<P>

   Dover is a sought-after authority on the sport. He teaches as well as trains in Wellington and New Jersey.<P>

   ``He's not just a participant in the sport,'' says Forbes. ``He's a mentor to the riders, a coach. You kind of wonder when the man sleeps.''<P>

   Seeing Dover ride might just be the most effective way to publicize the sport.<P>

   ``A lot of riders, when they ride you see their leg move, their hand move,'' Forbes said. ``You never see that [with Dover]. He's very charismatic. He enters the arena and you have to watch him.''
