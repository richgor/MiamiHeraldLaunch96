   Who hasn't thought, sometime: ``This intersection <m0>really <m0>needs a traffic light.''<ep>
   Lots of folks act on that thought every month. The county department of traffic engineering gets 30 to 40 requests for new signals every year, and the state Department of Transportation gets 10 to 20 more.<ep>
   In the end, about 15 new lights are installed each year in Broward County.<ep>
   ``We may have to turn it down the first time it's requested and we may restudy it every year,'' said Dick Smith, assistant director of the Broward County Traffic Engineering Department. ``We always respond to whoever writes the letter.''<ep>
   The response isn't always what people want to hear.<ep>
   In Plantation, it took many tries to get a signal at Nob Hill Road and Sunrise Boulevard before the light was installed in 1990. Today, cars back up half a mile in each direction during rush hours.<ep>
   It took more than six years of trying before a traffic light finally was installed in 1993 at Miramar Boulevard and Douglas Road in Miramar, even though accidents occurred there nearly every week.<ep>
   For about a year, residents in two Pembroke Park mobile home parks begged for traffic signals so they could safely cross five lanes of heavy traffic on Hallandale Beach Boulevard to get on Interstate 95. So far, only one has been installed.<ep>
   Now, a Plantation woman is fighting for a light at a western crossroads that turned deadly last year. Why does this process take so long? Find out in our story on <m0>Page 19.<m0><ql>
