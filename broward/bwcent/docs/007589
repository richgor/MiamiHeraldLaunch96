<m0>arents had night school at <m0>Nob Hill Elementary <m0>in Sunrise April 30 and left the kids at home for a change. It was the second annual Parent Technology Expo Night, a chance for parents to find out how students are keeping pace with computer technology.<ep>
 ``We hear a lot about `multimedia technology' these days,'' said Assistant Principal <m0>Michelle Ellison<m0>. ``I think our parents were surprised to see how it impacts the classroom.''<ep>
 Students and teachers demonstrated new software and laser disc equipment, displaying projects they had completed using the computers. Then they gave the parents a chance to sit down and sample various programs for themselves, with the help of the experts (--) the students.<ep>
 A vendors' fair displayed many hardware and software packages, and the retailers provided several items as door prizes for lucky winners. About 200 parents attended the fair.<ep>
 ''A lot of parents said we've really come a long way,'' Ellison.<ep>
<m1>Brain Bowl winners<ep>
<m0>   Congratulations to <m0>Western High School <m0>juniors <m0>Ronen Givony<m0> of Weston, <m0>Ethan Perlstein<m0> of Weston and <m0>Patrick <m0>and <m0>Billy Armshaw<m0> of Bonaventure, winners of the State Brain Bowl competition in Tampa on April 25-27. The team of National Honor Society members has been competing in local competitions each month since September.<ep>
  ``They just kept winning,'' said NHS co-sponsor <m0>Marguerite Kirschner. <m0>``They've been meeting on their own to practice (--) literally going through thousands and thousands of questions (--) and using the buzzer system like they do in the actual competitions, which makes it very intense.''<ep>
 Kirschner, who with co-sponsor <m0>Phyllis Pechter<m0> has brought Western's NHS membership from 29 in 1989 to more than 145 today, credits Principal <m0>David Hogg<m0>, who is retiring this year, with success at the contest.<ep>
 ``One of his goals was to increase the academic standings of the school,'' Kirschner said. ``I think this is a direct result. We really have kids knocking down our door now.''<ep>
 To be eligible for membership in NHS, students must have a 3.5 cumulative average by the second semester of their sophomore year. Those who qualify scholastically then must provide recommendation letters from teachers attesting to their demonstrated leadership and strength of character.<ep>
  ``It says a lot when colleges see NHS on their applications,'' Kirschner said. ``A lot of students don't realize that until it's too late, but it really makes a big difference.''<ep>
  Givony, who has been elected NHS president for next year, hopes to attend Princeton University to prepare for a political career.<ep>
