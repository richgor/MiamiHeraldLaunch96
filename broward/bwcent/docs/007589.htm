arents had night school at Nob Hill Elementary in Sunrise April 30 and left the kids at home for a change. It was the second annual Parent Technology Expo Night, a chance for parents to find out how students are keeping pace with computer technology.<P>

 ``We hear a lot about `multimedia technology' these days,'' said Assistant Principal Michelle Ellison. ``I think our parents were surprised to see how it impacts the classroom.''<P>

 Students and teachers demonstrated new software and laser disc equipment, displaying projects they had completed using the computers. Then they gave the parents a chance to sit down and sample various programs for themselves, with the help of the experts -- the students.<P>

 A vendors' fair displayed many hardware and software packages, and the retailers provided several items as door prizes for lucky winners. About 200 parents attended the fair.<P>

 ''A lot of parents said we've really come a long way,'' Ellison.<P>

   Congratulations to Western High School juniors Ronen Givony of Weston, Ethan Perlstein of Weston and Patrick and Billy Armshaw of Bonaventure, winners of the State Brain Bowl competition in Tampa on April 25-27. The team of National Honor Society members has been competing in local competitions each month since September.<P>

  ``They just kept winning,'' said NHS co-sponsor Marguerite Kirschner. ``They've been meeting on their own to practice -- literally going through thousands and thousands of questions -- and using the buzzer system like they do in the actual competitions, which makes it very intense.''<P>

 Kirschner, who with co-sponsor Phyllis Pechter has brought Western's NHS membership from 29 in 1989 to more than 145 today, credits Principal David Hogg, who is retiring this year, with success at the contest.<P>

 ``One of his goals was to increase the academic standings of the school,'' Kirschner said. ``I think this is a direct result. We really have kids knocking down our door now.''<P>

 To be eligible for membership in NHS, students must have a 3.5 cumulative average by the second semester of their sophomore year. Those who qualify scholastically then must provide recommendation letters from teachers attesting to their demonstrated leadership and strength of character.<P>

  ``It says a lot when colleges see NHS on their applications,'' Kirschner said. ``A lot of students don't realize that until it's too late, but it really makes a big difference.''<P>

  Givony, who has been elected NHS president for next year, hopes to attend Princeton University to prepare for a political career.<P>

   Thirteen Nova High seniors are finalists in the 1996 competition for the National Merit Scholarship Awards. This distinction is earned by scoring within the top 1 percent in the Southeast United States on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test.<P>

 They are: Dorothy Antullis of Davie, Holly Cukier of Plantation, Susan Curry of Plantation, Michael Feng of Coral Springs, Amy Fishman of Plantation, Neha Gandhi of Coconut Creek, Alexis Heiden of Fort Lauderdale, Krista Jacobs of Coconut Creek, Dan Lee of Coconut Creek, Andrew McAleavey of Tamarac, Neil Rosenberg of Davie, Joel Stengel of Hollywood, Amber Yoder of Pompano Beach. Another 11 Nova students ranked within the top 5 percent in the country.<P>

 Based on their scores, Lee and Curry have already received $2,000 National Merit scholarships.<P>

 The National College Board also recognized 16 Nova High students for achieving exceptionally high exam grades in advanced-placement classes. Named as AP Scholars with Distinction: Michael Feng, Dan Lee, Neil Rosenberg; AP Scholars with Honor: Jon Barone, Susan Curry, Neha Gandhi, Krista Jacobs, Joseph Lafiosca, Omer Ozkul and Marshall Ward.<P>

 Named as AP Scholars: Dorothy Antullis, Holly Cukier, Michael Greenberg, Andrew McAleavey, Joel Stengel and Amber Yoder.<BR>
