n a vision of downtown Davie's future, students leave a college campus to roam a landscaped Davie Road and Orange Drive, where sidewalk cafes, boutiques and trendy bookstores line the western-themed corridors.<P>

   The town began working on downtown revival in 1988, with the formation of a seven-member Community Redevelopment Agency Board. But other than a few new businesses and some renovations, the face of downtown Davie is virtually unchanged.<P>

    Concerns about the board's slow progress came up at last Wednesday's council meeting when town officials refused to appoint a new chairman without a clear idea of the board's goals.<P>

   ``It's not going to be Las Olas,'' said Vice Mayor Kathy Cox. ``People from the beach aren't going to come to downtown Davie to do their shopping. We need to shift the focus to who will come and spend the bucks, and the CRA needs to shift the focus, too.''<P>

   Town officials and board members agree that the key to a thriving downtown area is drawing the increasing student population from nearby colleges, technical schools and high schools to a pedestrian-friendly district, surrounded by activities for college-age youths.<P>

   Chairman Lowell M. Goode said the CRA does not have the funds it needs to put the many of the plans into action. Its budget last year was $95,000, including the director's salary, legal fees and operating costs.<P>

Until last summer, the county restricted the number of businesses moving into the downtown area because of traffic concerns. The town has only recently been exempted from that restriction and the board can now actively begin recruiting businesses.<P>

   The Davie Town Council in 1991 approved the Davie Settlement Plan. Created by urban planning scholars from the University of Miami, it visualizes Davie Road as a Main Street, attracting pedestrian traffic and evening activities.<P>

   But before the planned multistory buildings along Davie Road could open with apartments over businesses, the town must change its zoning codes.<P>

 Streetside parking and parking behind businesses also are encouraged by the plan, as pedestrian-friendly alternatives to parking lots.<P>

   ``We are not at odds with what council members want,'' said Glenn Irwin, executive director of CRA. ``We just need to sit down with them and make sure all of our goals are consistent.''<P>

   The Davie Town Council plans to meet with the CRA Board at 8:30 a.m. June 7 to discuss an updated plan for downtown.
