inning pitcher Joey Costanza struck out five batters in three innings to lead the Marlins over the Giants, 16-1, in Sunrise Little League Minors (ages 9-12) baseball April 26 at DCA Sports Complex.<P>

   Costanza, a left-hander, allowed no runs, no hits and three walks, improving to 7-0-1. He received solid defensive support, especially from second baseman Jeffrey Hittleman, who was awarded a game ball with four assists. Tommy Sfraga also got a game ball for his offensive heroics, which included a grand slam.<P>

   Andrew Collins and Costanza each hit two-run singles to ignite a four-run third inning, giving the Marlins (7-1-1) a 5-0 lead. Eric Abend's RBI double in the first put the Marlins ahead 1-0 in the first. First baseman Paul Jaeger snagged a line drive.<P>

   For the Giants (6-3), starting pitcher Jeremy Parrot struck out eight in three innings. Christopher DePelisi hit an RBI triple scoring Parrot, and Michael Sullivan made a good catch.<P>

   <LI> Anthony Bussiere hit two home runs to propel the A's (8-1) over the Angels, 16-1. Mike Lane hit his first home run of the season, and Steven Parry had three hits and scored twice. Gary Hurst added a base hit and scored twice.<P>

   Winning pitcher Raymond Garcia struck out four in two innings. Pitcher James Parry, Steven's twin, struck out eight in three innings. Outfielder Jonathan Greenstein performed well. The Angels are 6-3.<P>

   <LI> The Tigers tied the White Sox, 4-4, in a surprise. Tigers' pitcher Kevin Hesse struck out 13 batters and allowed just two hits in six innings. He also had a triple. Right fielder Alonso Thomas had a two-run single and also threw a runner out trying to stretch a hit into a double.<P>

   <LI> The Indians won a three-hour, eight-inning marathon over the Red Sox, 15-11. The game had four lead changes. Chris Weeks pitched the final inning to seal the victory.
