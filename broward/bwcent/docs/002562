<m0>fter four years of busing Dania children outside the city to swim, the Modello Park Pool is ready to reopen June 1 for this summer's swimming program.<ep>
   But the city is having trouble finding four part-time lifeguards to work at the $162,000 renovated pool, at 800 NW Second St., said City Manager Michael Smith.<ep>
   In March, the city began scouting for four lifeguards by sending mailings to Broward college students, taking out a newspaper ad and notifying the Red Cross, Smith said.<ep>
   But so far, the positions have been difficult to fill. ``We get a lot of potential lifeguards who don't want to work there,'' Smith said. ``The idea of working in a tough neighborhood is not that attractive to some people.''<ep>
   Modello Park and the pool are important to people in the neighborhood, said Dania Commissioner Bill Hyde. ``It's the central part of the community,'' he said. <m1>   <m0>There's another loose end to tie before the pool opens: Uneven, puddle-prone floors in the men's bathroom need to be fixed to meet health department requirements.<ep>
   ``We've got plenty of time to do those things,'' Smith said.<ep>
   For four years, time seemed to be standing still for the rebuilding project.<ep>
   After massive leaks forced the city to shut down the old pool in 1991, the park's swimming program shuttled kids to pools in the cities of Hollywood and Hallandale.<ep>
   The commission last year approved funding for the project after quelling some turf battles.<ep>
   The new pool is slightly larger and more shallow (--) five feet at its deepest level instead of eight (--) than the old one. It has an uncommon design: Both ends are three feet deep.<ep>
   The design makes it suitable for water basketball, volleyball and other water sports, Smith said.<ep>
   Before the opening, there will be fanfare. Sometime near the end of May, the city will host a party at the pool with refreshments, entertainment and games for kids, he said.<ep>
   ``There has been a lot of interest in having a pool again. It had been in place for more than 30 years,'' Smith said.<ep>
   The lifeguard positions will pay $8.96 an hour for up to 30-hour weeks. Three of them are summer only; the other is a year-round instructor.<ep>
   Lifeguard certification and CPR training are required. A knowledge of first aid and pool maintenance are helpful.<ep>
   Interested applicants should drop by personnel at Dania City Hall, 100 W. Dania Beach Blvd., between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.<ql>
