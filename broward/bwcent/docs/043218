<m0>ou don't have to travel far outside the urban reaches of South Florida to enjoy camping with your family. Stay put and experience a wide range of outdoor life.<ep>
   South Florida may not have mountains, canyons and rain forests. But one thing nearly all campgrounds have plenty of is water. You and your family will be kept very busy fishing, swimming, water sliding, canoeing, paddle boating and cable water skiing, so that you'll never miss those faraway climbs up steep Rockies looking for glaciers.<ep>
   Here is a list of South Florida's premier public campgrounds and what they offer:<ql>
<m1><ql>
<m0>BROWARD COUNTY<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,.4<ql>
<m0>QUIET WATERS PARK<ql>
<m0>6601 N. Powerline Rd., near Deerfield Beach<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   You will never run out of things to do at this sprawling, 427-acre park. You can canoe, fish or go cable water skiing (no boat needed) in the lake. A children's water playground features ``Splash Adventure'' (--) a waterborne amusement park with slides, swings, waterfalls, rotating tunnels and funny mirrors.<ep>
   When you grow tired of being waterlogged, hit the 18-hole miniature golf course, rent single and tandem bicycles, play softball, volleyball, football, soccer or horseshoes.<ep>
   Robert Hysell and sons Dustin, 14, Joseph, 11, and Charles, 3, make the 100-mile drive to Quiet Waters from Okeechobee about once a month.<ep>
   ``It's nice out here at night,'' Robert Hysell said. ``A good place to bring kids.''<ep>
   ``I caught a bunch of bass,'' Joseph said.<ep>
   Added Dustin: ``Water skiing is cool.''<ep>
   Open daily 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Reservations are a must. 360-1315. Tent camping costs $17 per night Sunday through Thursday for up to four people; $25 Friday, Saturday and holidays. Price includes: tent that sleeps up to six, one mat per person, 12-gallon cooler, grill, picnic table, boat and campfire ring. Facilities: Restrooms with showers.<ql>
<m0>MARKHAM PARK<ql>
<m0>16001 W. State Road 84, Sunrise<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The 665-acre park on the edge of the Everglades provides the usual water amenities: a fishing lake with paddle boat, rowboat and canoe rentals and a swimming pool with lockers and restrooms. But Markham offers some unexpected diversions: a personal watercraft recreation area, paved model airplane field, tennis/racquetball center, observatory for stargazing and a world-class target range.<ep>
   Martha Ricardo of Miami, daughter Elizabeth, 11, and another family camped for eight days at Markham during the Easter holidays. Ricardo said the group occupied itself with simple pleasures: biking, volleyball, basketball and hiking the milelong nature trail.<ep>
   The Ricardos said they were delighted by the wildlife that visited their campsite.<ep>
   ``We saw four owls on the nature trail,'' Martha reported. ``We were surrounded by squirrels, birds and raccoons.''<ep>
   Open daily 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Reservations encouraged. 389-2000. Tent camping $18 per night, including water and electric hookups. Facilities: Restrooms with showers.<ql>
<m0>TOPEEKEEGEE YUGNEE PARK<ql>
<m0>3300 N. Park Rd., Hollywood<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   This 150-acre urban park is located just west of Interstate 95 (--) less than a 15-minute drive from Hollywood beach and is adjacent to several shopping complexes. But there are lots of ways to amuse an active family without leaving the oak-shaded environs.<ep>
   Fish, canoe or paddle boat in a 40-acre lake. Slip down a water slide into the swimming lagoon. Rent bicycles and sports equipment. The park shows occasional movies and hosts hayride/campfire nights.<ep>
   Elsie and Ronnie Stevens of Fort Lauderdale frequently camp at TY Park with son Kodie, 3, and daughter Courtney, 5.<ep>
   ``Bike riding, fishing and the beach are fun,'' Elsie Stevens said. ``The kids enjoy the playgrounds. It's great relaxation.''<ep>
   Open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Reservations suggested. 985-1980. Tent camping $17 per night for up to two weeks. Facilities: Restrooms with showers and laundry. Some camping supplies are sold at the Trading Post.<ql>
<m0>DADE COUNTY<ql>
<m1><styl>vs,4<ql>
<m0>MILTON E. THOMPSON PARK<ql>
<m0>16665 NW 177th Ave.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   You'll forget you're in Dade County as you set up camp in this secluded 618-acre spot on the edge of the Everglades. Launch your canoe in one of three freshwater lakes to catch bass and look for lolling gators. You can also fish and hike along the canal that runs along Northwest 177th Avenue.<ep>
   Dade County corrections officer Hugo Montessi, his wife Emilia, son Gino, 9, and daughter Ana Emilia, 4 months, use the campground as a stopover between their Naples home and Hugo's Miami workplace.<ep>
   ``We start the morning with a good breakfast outdoors. Then we just hang around or ride bikes,'' Hugo Montessi said. ``At night, you can hear all kinds of sounds from the wild (--) that's music.''<ep>
   Open daily 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. 821-5122. No reservations. Tent camping $10 per night for up to three days. Facilities: Restrooms with showers, laundry room. A few camping supplies are sold at the office.<ql>
<m0>CAPE SABLE, EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK<ql>
<m0>10 miles off Flamingo<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   For a true wilderness experience, do Cape Sable the way Tom Wilson of Miami Shores and his party of 10 did it: rent a canoe for $30 at Flamingo, paddle 10 miles across Florida Bay, set up camp, build a fire and hang out on a vast, pristine, sugarlike beach.<ep>
   ``I'd like to have had a two-horsepower outboard,'' Wilson said afterward. ``Paddling for four hours can be tedious.''<ep>
   You don't have to paddle the open bay if you have your own boat. The trip takes about 30 minutes by powerboat.<ep>
    Wilson's fiancee, Susan Townsend of Nashville, said the long trek to Cape Sable was worth the effort. ``I have never seen so many stars,'' Townsend said. ``You could see the glow from Marathon and Key West.''<ep>
   Jan Klingner of Miami Shores enjoyed watching dolphins breaking the surface around her canoe and flocks of birds passing overhead: brown and white pelicans, ibis, egrets, herons, cormorants and ospreys.<ep>
   Son John, 6, also had fun on the trip. ``I caught a catfish on the way back,'' John Klingner said. ``I used turkey pastrami.''<ep>
   You also can paddle the Bear Lake canoe trail, but check with a park ranger first. The trail turns to quick mud in dry weather. U.S. Army Capt. Bruce Statler of Miami found out the hard way.<ep>
   ``It got so bad we had to get out in black quicksand-like stuff and push ourselves out of there,'' Statler said.<ep>
    A free back-country permit is required from Flamingo Visitor Center up to 24 hours before the trip. The visitor center is open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (941) 695-2945. Park entry fee $7.<ep>
   Facilities: None. Cape Sable is reachable only by canoe, kayak or shallow-draft powerboat. You must take one gallon per person per day of fresh water, food, compass, nautical charts, sunscreen, insect repellent, rain gear, sunglasses, tent (with netting), bedding and flashlight. You must pack out all trash.<ql>
<m0>LARRY AND PENNY THOMPSON PARK<ql>
<m0>12451 SW 184th St., Perrine<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   This 243-acre park next to Metrozoo features a 35-acre freshwater lake with a water slide, concession stand, white-sand beach and paddle boats. It's open Memorial Day through Labor Day, but campers can fish the lake all year. Park manager Mike Dmytriw offers field trips to Everglades National Park, Weeks Air Museum, Fairchild Tropical Gardens and other local attractions.<ep>
   The park's vegetation appears charred and stumpy in spots in the wake of Hurricane Andrew and recent brush fires. But birds abound, including swallowtail kites and hawks. Plenty of fruit trees (--) lychee nut, avocado and mango (--) dot the campground, but the fruit is off limits to campers.<ep>
   Open daily 9 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. 232-1049. Reservations not required. Tent camping $8 per night for up to one week. Scouts get special rates. Facilities: Four camp buildings, each with restrooms, showers and laundry facilities. Park store has minimal supplies.<ql>
