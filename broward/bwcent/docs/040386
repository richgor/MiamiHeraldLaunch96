<m0>ealth teacher <m0>Mary Adas<m0> at <m0>Western High School <m0>has organized a great way for more than 90 Western students to earn service hours. The kids helped Habitat for Humanity during the Building Blitz in Davie, which started May 3 and ends today.<ep>
 On the first day, a team of 30 students filled 100 45-gallon trash bags with debris they cleared from the housing site. They picked up trash, pulled weeds and trimmed and removed trees. They worked in the food tent set up for volunteers, provided security to ensure the safety of bystanders, hauled materials, scouted for nails dropped by roofers and hammered a few themselves.<ep>
 ``The kids had such a good attitude,'' Adas said. ``They learned all these skills that they never thought they could have done.''<ep>
 Doing backbreaking labor for someone else was a way of helping themselves, too. Each of the kids brought home a heightened sense of self-esteem at the end of the day.<ep>
 ``I figured it would be sort of a drag,'' said junior <m0>Jason Koenig<m0> of Weston. ``But once I got there, it was really nice to be part of people out there working together.''<ep>
 ``It's not some frivolous act,'' agreed senior <m0>Michelle Mayorga <m0>of Weston. ``You feel like you're really helping people.''<ep>
 And it's not like the kids are helping strangers. <m0>Michelle Irving, <m0>a cafeteria worker at Western High, will be moving into one of the new Habitat homes after the blitz.<ep>
 Adas, who has been nominated as Western's teacher representative at The Herald's Silver Knight awards this year, said that volunteering for Habitat for Humanity is her favorite way to help others.<ep>
 ``It was down and dirty, but it was fun,'' Adas said. ``You just feel these good vibes all over.''<ep>
  Students 14 and older are welcome to help Habitat for Humanity meet their goal of building 30 houses in Broward this year. For details, call 941-0404.<ql>
<m0>Theater magic<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   It was a little fantasy about love (--) performed by a cast of 30 children (--) Mozart's <m0>The Magic Flute. <m0>The Fort Lauderdale Children's Theatre Players put on the show at the Broward County Main Library in Fort Lauderdale April 26-May 5.<ep>
 In the story, a flute protects Tamino, played by <m0>Lawrence Trailer, <m0>a fifth-grader at <m0>Central Park Elementary, <m0>while he searches for Pamina, played by <m0>Country Isles <m0>fifth-grader <m0>Ilissa Knisley, <m0>daughter of the evil queen of the night, <m0>Ashlee Valdes, <m0>a sixth-grader at <m0>Tequesta Trace Middle School.<m0><ep>
 Sarastra, a good princess, was played by <m0>Vivie Savat, <m0>a fifth-grader at <m0>Pine Crest School.<ep>
<m0> Afterward, performers were available for autographs. Ashlee said acting is fun, and she'd like to be an actress or an astronaut.<ep>
 Ilissa said that she has wanted to act since she was little. ``I think I'll keep acting for a while. I like to sing, too.'' But that might not hold the key to her future, which includes more than magical love stories. ``I'm pretty good at math. I might want to do something there.''<ep>
 <m0>The Magic Flute  <m0>was Lawrence's 11th play. He loves the limelight. ``I want everybody to know me when I grow up,'' he said.<ep>
 Children interested in exploring the stage can find out more about summer programs by calling the Fort Lauderdale Children's Theatre at 763-6882.<ql>
<m0>A special arts festival<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Sawgrass Mills was the site again this year for the Very Special Arts Festival. This fifth annual event showcased the artistic accomplishments of students Monday through Friday.<ep>
 Each day was filled with dancing, singing and musical performances for the pleasure of family, friends and shoppers. <m0>Central Park, Embassy Creek, Nova Eisenhower, Hawkes Bluff, Peters <m0>and <m0>Silver Ridge <m0>elementary choruses performed, and the <m0>Seminole Middle School <m0>ensemble band played.<ql>
