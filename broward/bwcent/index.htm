<DD>T he fireworks will be popping in Bonaventure this week at two separate meetings of competing homeowner groups in LaCosta, where tempers are running hot these days. LaCosta is the troubled subdivision where only half of the planned homes have been built. Two developers claim they are going to finish the project, but there's a bankruptcy filing on the part of a third developer that's complicating the situation. One homeowners' meeting has been organized by LaCosta resident Barbara Shanahan for 8:30 p.m. Monday. Shanahan is aligned with developer Arnold DiGregorio. The other meeting, organized by LaCosta resident Marvin Edelstein, will take place at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday. Edelstein says developer Don Green will attend this meeting. Both meetings are at the Bonaventure Town Center Club, 16690 Saddle Club Rd., Bonaventure. <P>
