<m0>  Peggy Probert weighed 125 pounds. Now she's down to 74. A growth on her jaw curbed her ability to swallow, leaving her so thin that her shoulders feel like nothing but bone.<ep>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do if I get any thinner,'' she says.<ep>
   At age 86, Probert's circumstances are dire.<ep>
   But according to advocates for the elderly, her unique inventory of medical woes adds up to an increasingly common bottom line: She's not getting enough to eat.<ep>
   For Probert, of Miramar, bad health is the primary opponent. For others, the battle for sound nutrition is waged against other foes (--) too little money, isolation or factors that only come into play late in life.<ep>
   ``I heard the saddest story from a woman,'' said Ann Chickowski, a nutritionist for Broward Meals on Wheels. ``She came home from the grocery with two bags and the taxi dropped her at the curb. She took one bag inside. She walks with a cane. When she came back out, the other bag was gone. Stolen.''<ep>
   For seniors, weight loss is serious business. It weakens the body, invites illness and may lead to crippling depression.<ep>
   Probert, a soft-spoken woman with admirable spirit, is actually something of a success story. Her weight loss has been stemmed by an experimental nutrition program that's gaining notice.<ep>
   Broward Meals on Wheels, which provides about 3,500 seniors with low-cost meals at their homes or group sites, has targeted 16 people like Probert to receive special foods designed to be easy to eat.<ep>
   The food is pureed, then reformed into quichelike servings that are more palatable for seniors with dental problems or other physical disabilities. Meals on Wheels hopes to expand the program.<ep>
   ``I have five cases documented where the weight loss stopped,'' Chickowski says.<m1><ep>
<m0>   The progress is incremental. But it's regarded as significant among nutritionists and social workers who say problems with seniors and nutrition are finally getting needed attention.<ep>
   A report published in November 1993 by the Urban Institute of Washington, D.C., was the first national survey to document hunger among older Americans.<ep>
   Between 2.5 million and 4.9 million seniors, including many living above the poverty line, reported hunger or struggling with worries about food, according to the nonprofit group.<ep>
   In communities with large populations of older people, roughly 10 percent said that in the past six months they either had no food in their homes, skipped meals or wrestled with whether to buy food or medicine or pay the rent.<ep>
   Broward was not included in that survey. But nutrition problems are common among frail seniors in the county, according to a study published in 1995 by Florida International University researchers.<ep>
   Of about 100 mostly homebound seniors receiving community services, more than 80 percent were found at high or medium risk for malnutrition.<ep>
   Not enough food, isolation, dental problems, lack of money and the inability to shop or cook were listed as common barriers to nutritional health.<ep>
   Others had lost their appetites because they were taking improper combinations of prescription drugs. That problem is growing as people live longer.<ep>
   ``A lot of medications have side effects that reduce your appetite or your sense of taste,'' said Dr. Nancy Wellman, a dietetics and nutrition professor at FIU. <ep>
   Advocates for seniors said increased spending on nutrition programs makes economic sense. Good food means better health, shorter hospital stays and fewer nursing home placements.<ep>
   At the David Posnack Jewish Community Center in Davie, kosher meals are offered to anyone 60 or older. Lunch crowds top 50 on some days.<ep>
   Such meals, along with the accompanying social interaction, are treasured by seniors. But the Urban Institute found that most older people with food worries don't take advantage of government-sponsored meals. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Many don't know about the meals programs or may feel uncomfortable receiving subsidized food. Lines would be longer if community transportation offerings were better, said Alix B. Landman, a nutrition consultant who works for the Posnack Center.<ep>
 ``A lot of people . . . don't have the funds or the ability to drive,'' she said.<m1><ep>
<m0>   Peggy Probert and husband Kenneth Probert, 80, are among those lucky enough to get deliveries. On Wednesday, a week's worth of meals arrived in a box lugged by Meals on Wheels volunteer Donald Smith.<ep>
   Shepherd's pie and vegetable lasagna sat in plastic containers, ready for heating.<ep>
   ``It's all very good,'' Peggy Probert said. ``Look there. There's your potatoes. There's your carrots.''<ql>
