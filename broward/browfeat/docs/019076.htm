hree days a week, Sophia Womack tends to the dying. A nurse for Hospice Care of Broward County, she visits their homes to check their blood pressure, fluff their pillows and wipe their tears.<P>

   Lithe and quick-footed in their presence, she presents the perfect picture of the consummate caregiver. An unending source of energy.<P>

   Until, on her lunch and coffee breaks, she drives back to the office, unscrews the catheter in her stomach and gives herself a dialysis treatment.<P>

   Never before has the nurse, wife, and mother of two had so much in common with her patients.<P>

   Two years ago, Womack, who looks more like a teenager than a 32-year-old mother, was diagnosed with kidney failure because of hypertension.<P>

   Her kidneys just sit in her body, useless because they are unable to clear the toxins in her blood.<P>

   In a blue-striped recliner her co-workers set aside for her, she closes her eyes as a medicinal fluid courses through her belly and into her bloodstream.<P>

   It's no big deal, she says. If she gets a transplant soon, her prognosis is a long and healthy life.<P>

   But she also says this: The longer she waits for a donor, the more her risks increase. Risks of anemia, infection, bone disease. Even death.<P>

   ``I think I truly have more of an understanding about how it feels to lose your independence,'' she says. ``About how it feels to have someone else take control of your life and to be at the mercy of an illness.<P>

   ``It's the pits.''<P>

   Her two brothers, both of whom are suitable donors, are afraid to undergo the necessary operation to give her one of their kidneys, she says.<BR>
Thousands awaiting kidneys<P>

   More than 31,000 people in the United States also are waiting for kidneys, 160 of whom live in South Florida, according to the University of Miami's Transplant Program.<P>

   ``Sometimes I worry about my girls,'' Womack says, ``about them growing up without me.''<P>

   Her daughter Tiffany is 8, Toya 3.<P>

   People tell her she's crazy to work for Hospice at this point in her life. It's too draining on her psyche, they tell her.<P>

   Womack's mother, Sonya Johnson: ``She has been through so much and I never see her cry. I worry about her. I wish she would just stay home and take it easy.''<P>

   Womack's husband, Antonio Womack: ``I don't see how she goes to work and deals with death. I could never do it. Sometimes I go in the car with her when she has to go see a patient. It's too much for me. I stay in the car.''<P>

   But Womack says she learns too much from her clients to quit. Like the man who took photographs of the ocean until he couldn't hold a camera anymore. He taught her the importance of perseverance. And the woman who, until the day she died, was always doing something with her hands. Knitting, baking bread. Womack says she showed her the meaninglessness of self-pity.<P>

   And so each weekday, Womack makes her house visits -- a beeper that will only beep when a hospital finds her a suitable donor, clipped to her clothes.<BR>
First person clients meet<P>

   She is an admissions nurse, the first person the hospice clients meet.<P>

   ``The one who has to deal with the issues of life and death with people whose physicians have told them that there is nothing more that they can do to help,'' said Jo Bronson, spokeswoman for Hospice Care of Broward County. ``I could never do what she does.''<P>

   On Monday, Womack went to see Gloria Skillings in her tiny, one-room Fort Lauderdale apartment. The 68-year-old woman was curled up on her couch. Her face looks sunken, as if her cheeks are about to cave in.<P>

   ``I know I'm going to die,'' she says.<P>

   Womack takes hold of her hands and sits next to her on the couch.<P>

   This past weekend was horrible, the older woman says. No one came to visit, no one called. All she had for company was the constant pain from the stomach cancer and the soap operas on the 12-inch television in front of the sofa.<P>

   ``So I popped me some popcorn and threw myself a little party,'' she says.<P>

   Skillings' daughter, 36-year-old Kirsten Burgwin, sits at a small kitchen table. She too is ill, recuperating from eight strokes, she says. Her mother moved here from the Virgin Islands to take care of her.<BR>
4 daily dialysis treatments<P>

   The apartment grows depressingly silent.<P>

   When Womack first realized she was chronically ill, she was in her bedroom giving herself one of four daily dialysis treatments. Cardboard boxes filled with medical supplies for future treatments were stacked against the walls.<P>

   ``The reality of it just hit me, that I'm going to have to do this four times a day, every day. I started to cry.''<P>

   Six years ago, Womack's best friend died of cancer. She was 36. Seven years ago, her 5-day-old son died of a rare genetic disease.<P>

   Hoping to comfort others forced her to confront death, Womack joined Hospice five years ago.<P>

   ``I feel that death is something none of us want to face. But we know it's a reality. And it's something we have no control of.<P>

   ``But to me, in a spiritual way, we have to accept it. As hard as it is.''<P>

   Monday was only the second time Skillings and her daughter laid eyes on Womack, but the three talked and laughed in the little apartment as if they'd known each other for years.<P>

   ``I can relate,'' she said. ``Really relate.''
