   Sarah Freas had a very busy 24 hours last week. This Westminster Academy senior not only traveled with the Lions' water polo team to the state tournament in Orlando, but she also competed in the Class 2A state track & field meet in Gainesville.<P>

   In the middle of helping the Lions place second in water polo at state, Freas won a state title in the pole vault -- a debut event in girls' high school sports this season.<P>

   ``We were a little nervous going into state,'' Westminster Academy water polo coach Scott Moore said, ``but it worked out well.''<P>

   Moore added: ``We didn't want to take it away from her because she had a chance to do well in track, too.''<P>

   First, Freas had six goals to lift the Lions over Lake Howell, 18-10, in the state water polo opener Thursday. She scored three goals as the Lions continued their winning ways, defeating Miami's Ransom Everglades, 11-5, Friday afternoon.<P>

   Then, Freas made a two-hour trip with her father, Sam, to Gainesville, participating in the first sanctioned state girls' pole vault championship for Lions Coach Greg Beaupied. She was late to the state meet because of an automobile accident and traffic.<P>

   ``It was bad on the way to Gainesville,'' Freas said. ``I was an hour late so I was wired and really nervous that things wouldn't work out, but they did.''<P>

   After clearing 9 feet and winning the 2A title without any warmups, she returned to Orlando Friday night.<P>

   ``When I got back to the hotel, I was really tired,'' said Freas, who will swim for the United States Air Force Academy.<P>

   Pole vaulting runs in the family. Her older brother Sam Freas III was a state champion in the pole vault in 1994, and younger brother Steve, who attends Satellite Beach High, has reached the 5A state tournament in the pole vault. Her father also was a pole vaulter in high school.<P>

   ``Sarah is a great athlete,'' Moore said. ``I don't know how many athletes who could have done it.''<P>

   Saturday morning, Freas scored twice to spark the Lions in a semifinal victory over Winter Park, 8-2. An all-American swimmer and water polo player, she ended her high school sports career later in the day, when Westminster fell to host Lake Brantley, 9-5. Freas, also an Academic all-American, scored a goal to culminate a rewarding three days.<P>

   In water polo there is no classification so the big and small schools compete on the same level.<BR>
