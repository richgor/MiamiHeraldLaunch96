   Mollie Meyers has made her plans for this weekend.<P>

   The car stays parked. Food supplies have been gathered. She's prepared for the upcoming siege by air and sea.<P>

   Saturday and Sunday will bring the Shell Air & Sea Show practically to Meyers' doorstep. She lives east of the Intracoastal Waterway near Hugh Taylor Birch State Recreation Area, and she'll be hemmed in by hundreds of thousands of cars and people. Trying to get out of her neighborhood will be like trying to escape Alcatraz.<P>

   Still, Meyers doesn't mind.<P>

   ``The good outweighs the bad,'' she said. ``You can't fight it, so you might as well enjoy it.''<P>

   Last year, promoters estimated 800,000 people attended the weekend show. This year, some say a million people could fill the beach over the two-day event.<P>

   So, that's a million people, a kajillion cars, thousands of boats, and considerably less than a million places to park.<P>

   Here are some ways to keep this weekend painless:<P>

   <LI> Passes, please: Residents who live in neighborhoods east of the Intracoastal Waterway between Oakland Park Boulevard and Las Olas Boulevard should already have passes that will let them through police checkpoints. If you haven't already received yours, call this number now: 761-5668. This is the information line for the Fort Lauderdale Police Department, and it may take a day or two for them to get to your message. Don't put this off.<P>

   <LI> Public transportation: Use it. Really. Many people get testy trying to weave their way out of Joe Robbie Stadium during a sold-out Dolphins game. Joe Robbie holds 75,000. Multiply that number 10 times and you've got a traffic jam.<P>

   Shuttle buses will run from downtown parking lots and Holiday Park to the main viewing area. It costs $3 to park and $3 for a round-trip shuttle ride.<P>

   Also, remember that the show's conclusion will bring together the tens of thousands of tired, sunburned, possibly grouchy people. A little patience in boarding the buses will help everyone leave smoothly, says Liz Brisset, marketing manager for Broward County Transit.<P>

   ``Everyone will be trying to get out at the same time,'' she said. ``Have patience, just like with the Fourth of July or Winterfest.''<P>

   <LI> If you have to use your car: Park west of the Intracoastal and bike in. Strap on your in-line skates. Walk in. West of the Intracoastal is your best bet for finding any spaces -- and it may be far west of the Intracoastal. Hugh Taylor Birch State Recreation Area will not be open to the public for parking.<P>

   <LI> Take to the seas: And be careful. Capt. Tim Morgan, head of marine towing company Seatow, expects a busy weekend. Common problems include boaters draining their batteries by leaving their accessories on, large boats swamping smaller vessels, drunk boaters and inexperienced boaters.<P>

   ``If everyone used their common sense, I guess we'd be out of business,'' Morgan said.<P>

   Everyone on board should be wearing a life jacket, he said. Don't overload your boat, no matter how many neighbors beg to come along. Designate a driver, just as on land. If you want to listen to the radio simulcast of the show, bring along a portable boombox to avoid draining the boat batteries with hours of use.<P>

   Finally, don't rush for the inlet at the end of the show. That's when boats get swamped by the wake of larger vessels, Morgan said.<P>

   If there's a mad dash, ``sit back, relax, have a couple of sodas and wait,'' he said.<BR>
