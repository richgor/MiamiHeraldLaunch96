  For more than 60 years, repairing watches has been Wallace ``Wally'' Greene's life.<P>

   Greene, 78, and a Coconut Creek resident, first fiddled with a watch as a teenager living in Manhattan during the 1930s.<P>

   He entered the watch business in 1934 as a floor sweeper at Jacob Cohen & Sons on Canal Street, once one of New York's largest watch and jewelry wholesalers.<P>

   Today, Greene still repairs watches and is a part-time watchmaker employed by Little Jewelers, a watch and jewelry concessionaire that operates in the Sears store at Coral Square mall.<P>

   He's always had the steady hands and good coordination needed for the meticulous work. The only thing that's changed is his eyesight -- he needs a stronger magnifying glass than he did in the old days.<P>

   Rebecca Ryan, manager of Little Jewelers in Coral Springs, has known Greene for 14 years.<P>

   ``Wally knows everything about watches and has quite a following with our customers,'' Ryan said. ``I don't know what we are going to do here after he retires.''<P>

   Greene works three days a week, eight hours a day behind a counter near a Sears entrance. Customers can see him bent over a magnifying glass at one of the two work benches.<P>

   He has about 50 tools at his bench, each for a different task. For most jobs, he uses nonmagnetic tools -- a knife to open the case, a screwdriver, tweezers.<BR>
Dying art<BR>
<P>

  According to Greene, watchmaking became a dying industry in the 1980s.<P>

   ``All the old-time independent watchmakers weren't being replaced by younger people,'' he said. ``Today, the younger generation isn't interested in watch repair because the job is time-consuming, tedious and it doesn't pay much anymore.'' <P>

   Of course, whether a job pays well is relative. When Greene started at Cohen & Sons, he made $8 a week.<P>

   After learning his trade from a professional watchmaker, Greene noticed that a common problem with watches was with their balance wheel staffs -- metal gears that control the timing of the watch. Watchmakers had to regularly repair balance wheel staffs from the 1930s until the '60s.<P>

   ``Watches were stronger and lasted longer than today's plastic watches,'' Greene said. ``Then they were made of brass and steel and didn't have batteries; you had to wind up their main spring by hand, which keeps an average watch ticking for 30 hours.''<P>

   By 1940, Greene had mastered his watchmaking trade, and Cohen promoted him to wholesale watch salesman and buyer. In 1942, Greene left the company to serve a three-year stint in the U.S. Army Air Corps.<P>

   After his discharge in 1945, Greene returned to work at Cohen until 1954. During the late 1940s, Greene invented a belt watch that was patented in 1950.<BR>
Waisting time<BR>
<P>

   It's a kind of watch that attaches to a person's belt. It's normally worn by tradesmen or sportsmen who can't wear a watch around their wrist, but need to know the time.<P>

   In 1954, he left Cohen for Freudenheim Brothers, then moved to Florida in 1956, and continued his trade at Burdines in North Miami Beach. He left in 1986 to move north to Coconut Creek, and in 1992, went to work for Little Jewelers at Sears' Broward Mall and Coral Square mall stores.<P>

   Unlike today, Greene says, people years ago looked for quality and well-known manufacturers' names when buying a watch.<P>

``Many people now buy only watches that are on sale,'' he said. ``They buy inexpensive plastic watches. They don't last long, almost always break and I can't repair them, so we throw almost all of them away.''
