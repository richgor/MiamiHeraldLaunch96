<m0>    At 88, Buddy Ebsen still embraces Beverly Hillbilly Jed Clampett. The back of his terry cloth shirt sports an Ebsen-original drawing of Uncle Jed and Ole Duke hunting for food.<ep>
   He signs autographs: ``Weeee Doggies!'' And he scratches his head in that sort-of confused ``poor mountaineer'' kind of way as he ponders his induction into Fort Lauderdale's International Swimming Hall of Fame Friday as a Gold Medallion winner.<ep>
   ``How I was invited to be here among these international swimming stars, that's an unwritten story, because I don't know,'' said Ebsen, who also played Barnaby Jones, the milk-drinking, calm and cool private eye on the '70s prime-time television series of the same name.<ep>
   But he gladly accepted the honor, arriving Thursday in Fort Lauderdale with Dorothy, his German-born wife of 11 years. They reside in Californie, of course! Palos Verdes Estates, to be exact.<ep>
   And for a day, the Hall of Fame could boast both swimming pools <m0>and<m0>  movie stars!<ep>
   Ebsen said he often watches reruns of <m0>The Beverly Hillbillies  <m0>and owns Jed Clampett's tattered hat, coat and shot gun. He is only half-joking when he suggests that the hat be bronzed and housed in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.<ep>
   ``<m0>The Beverly Hillbillies  <m0>had a kind of therapeutic value,'' Ebsen said. ``Everybody has bad days, things that don't go right, but after a half-hour of <m0>The Beverly Hillbillies, <m0>I know I feel better.''<ep>
  For the present, Ebsen spends his time oil painting and touting his autobiography, <m0>The Other Side of Oz, <m0>which<m0> <m0>talks<m0> <m0>about his experience as the original Tin Man in <m0>The Wizard of Oz<m0>. He spent eight weeks recuperating from the aluminum makeup dust that covered his lungs during the original filming, which cost him the part in the movie.<ep>
   Ebsen also has written a novel to be published by Christmas about a ``single girl seeking Mr. Right.'' <ep>
   Hall of Fame spokeswoman Holly Heil said the Gold Medallion Award goes ``to the one person each year who has given greatly to the community and has a background in swimming.'' Past recipients include Barry Goldwater and Art Linkletter.<ep>
   By that definition, Ebsen fits the bill. In his hometown of Belleville, Ill., Ebsen said he learned to swim almost as soon as he learned to walk. He lived in a ``two-room shack,'' he said, similar to the Clampetts' abode before Jed struck oil. His father, a high school swimming coach, dammed up a group of springs in the back yard, forming a pond for swim practice.<ep>
   When Ebsen was 11, his family moved to Orlando, and by 1926, his senior year in high school, Ebsen became a Florida state swimming champion. Competing for Orlando High School, Ebsen won in the 100-yard breast stroke. ``My mom said, `This year, you are going to win, son,' and I did,'' Ebsen recalled.<ep>
   Ebsen's swimming career ended when he entered the University of Florida as a pre-med student. But dreams of medicine died with the collapse of the Florida land boom. Ebsen no longer could afford to continue his studies.<ep>
   In 1928, Ebsen and his sister, Vilma, loaded up the truck and moved to New York City, where they billed themselves as a brother-and-sister dance team. They landed in some vaudeville shows and performed with such stars as Ruby Keeler, Eddie Cantor, Jimmy Dorsey, and Shirley Temple. Movies followed.<ep>
     But it was his role as Jed Clampett, the original patriarch of that celebrated piece of Americana, for which he will be most remembered. The series ran 267 episodes from 1962 to 1971. The Jan. 4, 1968, episode remains the highest-rated half-hour sitcom since 1960.<ep>
   ``Granny [Irene Ryan] was going to cook one of those Australian things, a kangaroo,'' Ebsen fondly recalled. ``She called it `The world's largest jack rabbit.' ''<ep>
   Ryan passed away in 1973, but Ebsen said he frequently talks to Max Baer Jr. (Jethro) and Donna Douglas (Ellie Mae.)<ep>
   Ebsen was cast as Barnaby Jones opposite Lee Meriwether in 1972. The series ran for eight years. In 1994, Ebsen starred as Barnaby Jones in the movie <m0>The Beverly Hillbillies<m0>. Granny was kidnapped, and the writers decided Barnaby should rescue her.<ep>
   ``Barnaby appealed to women,'' Ebsen said. ``In today's moral and criminal climate, they liked the idea that somebody like Barnaby Jones was out there fighting evil.<ep>
   ``Women tell me, `Oh, Barnaby, you are still with me in my bedroom every night [in reruns].''<ep>
   Wife Dorothy chuckles. She had never heard of Jed Clampett or Barnaby Jones when she met Ebsen, father of six children, in Long Beach, Calif., at the Congressional Cup sailing competition.<ep>
   She encouraged him to paint after seeing his cartoon illustrations of Old Jed and his beloved hound dog, Duke. His oil paintings are on display at galleries in California and Hawaii.<ep>
   He even swims occasionally in his condominium pool.<ep>
   ``My favorite role is whatever I am <m1> <m0>doing at the moment,'' Ebsen said. ``I just do the best I can and let the chips fall where they may and hope people like what I do.''<ql>
