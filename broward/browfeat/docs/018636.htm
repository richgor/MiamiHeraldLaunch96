<B><FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT></B>ort Lauderdale trial attorney Jeffrey Orseck of TV ad fame finally received a presidential appointment from his college chum Bill Clinton -- three years, three months and a couple weeks after Clinton took office. The president has announced his intent to appoint Orseck to the Panama Canal Consultative Committee.<P>

   OK, so it's not quite the ambassadorship to Costa Rica that Orseck thought he'd get three years ago -- a ``lifelong ambition,'' he said at the time. But with the United States relinquishing operational control of the Panama Canal in 1999, the advisory committee post could at least be interesting.<P>

   Orseck earned a degree in foreign service with Clinton at Georgetown University, and raised more than $1 million in campaign money for his former classmate.<P>

``I think it's a difficult assignment,'' Orseck said Sunday. ``It's not a popular decision, transferring the Panama Canal from the United States' possession to Panamanian sovereignty. I'm very interested in completing it successfully on behalf of the president and our country.''<BR>
<P>

<B>RECUPERATING:</B> Norma Howard, 69, director of the Broward County Bar Association for 31 years, is recovering at Holy Cross hospital after suffering a stroke -- in the middle of her retirement party. ``It was horrible,'' says Cynthia White, the bar's new director. ``Everything had been so lovely, the evening had been so wonderful, then all of a sudden. Dinner was basically over and she was about to get up and say her thank-yous but she couldn't stand, she fell over. At first everyone thought she had just fallen. It took a couple minutes to realize what had happened. Then we called 911.''<P>

   The stroke affected Howard's left arm and leg, but not her speech, and she's expected to return home soon, White said.<BR>
<P>

<B>SHORT TAKES:</B> A salute to Austin and Ruth Tupler, and Mara and Donald Giulianti, honored for their continued support of Women in Distress . . . Best wishes to Sonia Ginsberg, longtime director of the Association of Retarded Citizens, who has retired. Bob Burton takes over the agency . . . There's just something unsettling seeing the slain Hollywood child Adam Walsh's father, John, now host of Fox TV's America's Most Wanted, being featured in a leather jacket sitting on a Harley as one of People magazine's 50 most beautiful people. ``He's like a phoenix rising from the ashes,'' his wife, Reve, said.<BR>
<P>

<B>QUOTEABLE:</B> So almost everyone who visits the Dave and Buster's restaurant/arcade complex in Hollywood says the same thing: Dave and Buster are obviously ready to open a full casino if gambling becomes legal. Responds Dave Corriveau: ``We've heard that before in other markets. But we have no interest in being in the gambling industry. We provide the feel and thrill of a casino without the burden of reality.'' Read that -- losing money. Besides, Dave and Buster's makes lots without gambling.<BR>
<P>

<B>WINGING IT:</B> Among the accomplishments of state Rep. Jack Tobin, D-Margate, during the legislative session -- passage of a bill designating the zebra longwing butterfly as the state's official butterfly. House leaders told Tobin that Gov. Chiles' wife, Rhea, and her garden club were enamored of the insect and asked if he would sponsor the bill. Tobin figured he'd take some razzing from colleagues, but then remembered that the Butterfly World tourist attraction was in his district. So he agreed. ``It flew through the House,'' said Tobin. (State Sen. Howard Forman, D-Pembroke Pines, sponsored the measure in the Senate.) For the bill signing in Tallahassee, Butterfly World sent 15 zebra longwings sleeping peacefully in tiny cellophane pouches inside the dark, dark FedEx box.
