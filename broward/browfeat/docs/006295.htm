  What does it take to build a high school library for the 21st Century?<P>

   First off, don't call it a library.<P>

   As the new media specialist at High School EEE will tell you, media centers have come a long way. Dusty tomes of Romeo and Juliet and Moby Dick are now joined by CD-Rom, laser discs, digital cameras and computer scanners.<P>

   ``We don't just store things, we also create things,'' said Doug Pearce.<P>

   As head of the new high school's media center, Pearce has spent the past few months looking for the necessary tools to do just that -- create things. With a budget of $290,000, he has had to make decisions like buying the Encyclopaedia Britannica book set, the disc version -- or both. He bought both.<P>

   ``It's been a big job,'' said Pearce, whose other decisions like what type of computer software and forms of periodicals -- again hard copy or disc -- to buy haven't been as cut and dried as the encyclopedia question. ``No longer is information provided in print only.''<P>

   Slated to open in the fall for ninth-, 10th- and 11th-graders, the school and its media center, at 12800 Taft St. in Pembroke Pines, have been billed as models for the 21st Century. That designation, said Pearce, is not only due to EEE's career-focused curriculum, but also because of the school's emphasis on technology.<P>

   ``The days where librarians simply checked out books are over,'' said Pearce, 42, a social studies teacher turned media specialist. ``To run a library these days, it takes some level of technological sophistication. You need to understand how to distribute information electronically.''<P>

   And that is exactly what Pearce will have to do as one of two media specialists at EEE. Except for a few cabinets, yards of fiber-optic wiring and busy construction workers putting on last-minute touches, the media center is empty. Soon, however, its 8,819 square feet of space will be filled with about 15,000 books, dozens of computers and a multitude of electronic databases and equipment.<P>

   The central learning hub of the school, the media center also is the site of the EEE's central communication closet. The closet, which has yards upon yards of fiber-optic wiring and a patch panel already in place, will serve as the central control network for the school's 400 to 600 personal computers. With the computers networked, students and teachers will have library information readily accessible from their classroom terminals.<P>

   ``What makes this school unique is we are placing all of the 21st Century technology in one institution,'' said Barbara Correll, the school district's director of Learning Resources.<P>

   Correll and her office have been working closely with Pearce and EEE Principal Sara Rogers in helping them figure out how to best furnish the media center.<P>

   ``The emphasis for librarians is no longer on keeping books straight, making children line up in straight lines or keep quiet,'' said Correll, who estimates that the district has between 225 and 230 school media specialists. ``Right now, you have to have a strong interest in the technology because more and more information is coming down.''<P>

   While librarians or media specialists still have to like people and realize they are there for service, nowadays they must also be able to show students how to turn a simple book report into something with computer-generated graphs, scanned photographs and information off the Internet.<P>

   Though Pearce has been a media specialist only a short time, Rogers said it was his vision of how technology and traditional library resources can be integrated that led her to hire him over nine other applicants for the job last fall.<P>

   ``I was looking for someone who had the willingness to make the media center accessible to everybody,'' Rogers said. ``We want the media center to become a part of everything the students do. Doug has really attacked that and learned so much about how to make that happen.''<P>

   While he doesn't claim to be an expert when it comes to technology, Pearce has been a trouble-shooter where the new media center and school are concerned. Having worked at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School -- the last Broward high school to be built and the prototype for EEE -- since its opening six years ago, Pearce has been able to provide Rogers and others with lots of foresight.<P>

   But unlike at Douglas, where many of his years were spent teaching students about the history of the world, at EEE Pearce will show them how to use that history. In a lot of cases, his job will be showing students how to take what they have learned and make it part of a big media presentation using everything from the Internet to digital cameras to scanners to encyclopedias.<P>

   ``My relationship with students will change,'' Pearce said. ``But I can impact a lot of kids this way. I can make the school more fun and more educational in a global sense.''
