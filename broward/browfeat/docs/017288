<m0>   It looked like a huge party (--) but it sounded more like war.<ep>
   Military and civilian planes buzzed Fort Lauderdale beach Friday, performing aerobatic stunts and impressing more than 5,000 middle and high school students who were lucky enough to get a day off from school.<ep>
   In a scene reminiscent of spring break or Mardi Gras, students strolled along a blocked-off section of State Road A1A near Hugh Taylor Birch State Recreation Area as they watched the multimillion-dollar aircraft dance in the sky. Kids sang, danced and soaked up the sun while engines overhead whined and pilots showed off their skills.<ep>
   The daylong event was the First Union/North Broward Hospital District Kids Day, part of the 1996 Shell Air & Sea Show taking place on the beach today and Sunday. It was meant to promote patriotism and team work.<ep>
<m0>  <m0> Students ogled a Marine Harrier jet as it screamed past them, only to stop moments later and hover less than 20 feet above the water. The U.S. Coast Guard simulated a search-and-rescue mission, using every aircraft in their arsenal to pluck a swimmer from the ocean. A Bud Light jet performed stunts and kids oohed and aahed over the aerobics from the TresCom Lima Lima flight team.<ep>
   ``I just like the planes, the boats and the fresh air. I've always had a fascination with airplanes,'' said Jesse Allen, 15, a South Broward High School sophomore. ``When I first got here, I thought it would be boring. But it has been a nice day.''<ep>
  Everybody got a free lunch. There were snacks throughout the day, as well as souvenir gifts from corporate sponsors.<ep>
   ``It's cool because I get to skip a day of school legally to watch a bunch of airplanes,'' said Western High freshman Melissa Clifford, 15.<ep>
  At the U.S. Marine Corps recruiting tent, hundreds of students pushed their way to the front to compete in a pull-up contest for prizes. The students were more than the recruiters had planned on.<ep>
   ``We had more participation than we expected and had to call for reinforcements,'' said Gunnery Sgt. Leo Fraraccio. ``We were overwhelmed.''<ep>
   That's exactly what Broward Schools Partnerships Director Merrie Meyers-Kershaw wanted to hear. She helped coordinate the sponsorships for Kids Day. To her, the day was meant as fun and games mixed with a message for students: Stay in school so you can help your country in the future.<ep>
   To help bolster that idea, she had every school broadcast an educational film about the military and had students countywide meet with members of the Blue Angels, the Navy's aerobatic flying team, and the Golden Knights, the Army's expert parachute team.<ep>
   ``It is very inspirational. When you meet these people who are real-life heroes . . . and they talk to these kids about how [they] have to be on top of their game, that means something,'' she said.<ql>
