  The eye and hand of Paul Richard McNeil are all over Broward.<P>

   The swirling curve of steel rods towering 22 feet at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport was acquired by the county while McNeil was chairman of the defunct Art in Public Places Board in the 1980s.<P>

   So was the solar sculpture at the Broward County Main Library in downtown Fort Lauderdale, as was an abstract wall relief at the Governmental Center.<P>

   McNeil, who served on the commission for its entire 14-year existence and who helped acquire 179 pieces valued at more than $824,000 to beautify public buildings, died April 27 from a neurological disorder. He was 66.<P>

   ``They probably spent more money during his term than anyone's,'' said Fred Reissner of Fort Lauderdale, a longtime friend. ``He placed the largest number of pieces during a real busy time.''<P>

   A real-estate broker and entrepreneur in Florida and San Francisco, McNeil believed public works of art reflected well on Broward County.<P>

   ``He thought they were a great asset to the community and a great legacy for the future,'' Reissner said.<P>

   The board, whose members were appointed by the County Commission and whose budget came from public funds, faced criticism and controversy for purchases: The stainless steel sculpture at the airport cost $250,000; the library's solar sculpture, $100,000; and the abstract at the Governmental Center, $65,000. The County Commission dissolved the art board in 1990.<P>

   A lover of the arts, McNeil was a member of the Broward Art Guild, Museum of Art, the Museum of Discovery & Science, the Philharmonic Society, the Fort Lauderdale Players, the Greater Fort Lauderdale Film Festival and the Gold Coast Jazz Society. He also was active in Republican politics, serving as the precinct committeeman for the Broward County Republican Central Committee since 1981.<P>

   McNeil was born in Cleveland and earned a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., in the 1950s. He lived in San Francisco, where he established Paul McNeil Realty, before moving to Fort Lauderdale in 1967 to help take care of his parents. He formed McNeil Realty in Fort Lauderdale when he came to Broward, and operated both businesses simultaneously.<P>

   He is survived by a sister, Marie Wilson of Arlington, Va.<P>

   A memorial service will be at 4 p.m. today at the Church by the Sea, 2700 Mayan Dr., Fort Lauderdale.
