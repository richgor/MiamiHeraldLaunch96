  For 70 years, the home of Fort Lauderdale pioneer Doreatha Hankerson Bragdon was a favorite gathering place of children and adults alike.<P>

   Bragdon, whose frame house at Northwest Second Street and Ninth Avenue faced the Northwest Branch Boys Club, watched and fed neighborhood children and adults. <P>

   Bragdon, who lived in the city since 1924, died Sunday at age 86.<P>

   ``We'd have children everywhere,'' recalled her daughter, Brenda Dooling of Fort Lauderdale. ``She loved talking to and encouraging the guys and girls.''<P>

   Bragdon's home near Broward Boulevard -- on the dividing line in the black section of then-segregated Fort Lauderdale -- was also a place many adults went for a meal.<P>

   ``I could remember strangers passing through -- black and white would stop by, and mother would feed them,'' Dooling said. ``I think it grew out of the Depression when people didn't have food to eat. She could take one piece of meat and feed 20 people.''<P>

   Bragdon was a charter member of the Boys Club, and a volunteer who taught cooking, and watched generations of children while parents worked.<P>

   ``Mrs. Bragdon was like the overseer,'' said Jim Hill, Fort Lauderdale's assistant city manager for business retention. ``She kept an eye on the club.''<P>

   Hill worked at the club when he first came to the city in 1968. ``Mrs. Bragdon was one of the first persons I met and she welcomed me to Fort Lauderdale,'' he said. ``She was an excellent, excellent lady.''<P>

   Bragdon was born in White Springs, Fla., and moved to Fort Lauderdale with her family to find work. She married Henry Pleamon Bragdon, former Mount Olive Baptist Church pastor, who in the 1930s built the church's membership to 500, Dooling said. She was a member of the choir Missionary Society and a deaconess. She also helped rebuild the church when it was destroyed by hurricanes in 1926 and 1928.<P>

   She believed that all people were special and instilled that belief in her children, Dooling said.<P>

   ``She believed there's a light inside each person,'' said Dooling, an adult education teacher in Fort Lauderdale. ``She taught me that all I have to do is stand back and observe, and I'd know what to say and do to bring that light out.'' <P>

   In addition to her daughter, Bragdon is survived by sister Trudie Stephens, of King of Prussia, Pa.; children Patsy Barnes, and Henry and Ernie Bragdon, all of Fort Lauderdale, Dorothy Wood of Portsmouth, Ohio, and Frema Bragdon of Henderson, Tenn.; 20 grandchildren, 19 great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren.<P>

   Visitation will be from 5 to 9 p.m. today at Roy Mizell Funeral Home. Service is 1:30 p.m. Friday at Mount Olive Baptist Church, 400 NW Ninth Ave., Fort Lauderdale.
