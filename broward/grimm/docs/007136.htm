<B><FONT SIZE=+3>U</FONT></B>nderstand that I'm no herbal-tea, world-peace, daisy-picking, transcendental, tie-dyed, nonviolent Nancy boy.<P>

   Loved Dirty Harry. Loathed Bridges of Madison County. ``Shoot her, Clint. Make my day.''<P>

   Can't abide figure skating, golf, tennis and most other civilized athletic endeavors. Televised baseball lulls me comatose.<P>

   I'm plainly an unenlightened fan of controlled sports violence. A vicarious thug. My favorite all-time football team remains the infamous '90 Hurricanes. (Thought the Cotton Bowl refs violated UM's right to free expression.) I want a Heat team of scowling meanness.<P>

   But hockey . . . hockey stuns me.<P>

   It's the violence. Not the purposeful bashings committed in pursuit of the game. Not even the occasional hooking and slashing, which, after all, could have been accidental. Oops. Sorry.<P>

   It's when the game suddenly stops to accommodate a fight. Players discard their hockey sticks, litter the ice with equipment -- ``drop the gloves'' in the hockey vernacular for brawling -- and proceed to wallop.<P>

   No one minds. They fight, happy as alley dogs, without arousing more than casual interest from the referees, until one of the combatants loses his balance. Only then, the refs intervene.<P>

   It's an odd scene for a sports fan accustomed to prohibitions and hefty fines for fighting in professional football and basketball: that nonchalant referee, passively waiting for the fight's end like Aunt Martha watching for her 5:30 bus.<BR>
Unrepentant hockey<BR>
<P>

  Earlier in the playoffs, in the Panthers-Boston series, I was in the stands when gloves dropped and players flailed about the ice, a brawl, a melee, a South Florida variation on the old Rodney Dangerfield line: ``I went to the fights and a hockey game broke out.''<P>

   After 20 minutes, the pugilists tired, the ice was cleared and penalties assessed -- most of them meted out in minutes for offenses that in the NBA or NFL would have rung up a fortune in fines.<P>

   Not in unrepentant hockey.<P>

   No, I'm not preaching a new love-soaked morality to hockey players, who generally seem less afflicted by punk attitudes than their less-violent counterparts in other major sports. But if the National Hockey League's nurturing attitude toward brawling startles a low-life like me, then the NHL is skating fast toward a marketing dilemma.<P>

   And as a taxpayer in a county peddling 30-year bonds for a $212 million hockey palace, I've developed a personal interest in the NHL's long-term prospects.<BR>
Should kids see this?<BR>
<P>

  Hockey, as it abandons Canadian snows for the U.S. sun belt, dearly craves yuppies and prosperous suburbanites who can afford $40 ($54.40 Canadian) a ticket. But those are the very folks, new to hockey's rough traditions, who might hesitate exposing their 10-year-olds to the NHL's peculiar brand of conflict resolution.<P>

   Some of these folks escaped to the dull suburbs to protect their children from toughs and looming violence. How, then, to explain Ed Jovanovski?<P>

   The NHL, with fines and suspensions, could easily reshape hockey into something other than a bar fight. But the league hesitates to offend a smallish but insanely fervent base of fans -- some with tattoos -- who think individual combat is high entertainment, integral to the game.<P>

   NHL honchos treasure those blood-lust loyalists but they simultaneously want network TV contracts, a vast national audience, hero status for its stars and so many $212 million arenas in sun-splashed metropolitan areas.<P>

   They want their cake and violence too.
