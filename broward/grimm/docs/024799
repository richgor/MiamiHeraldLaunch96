<m0>halk up 15 deaths, so far, to FDA deregulation.<ep>
   Thanks to a right-wing congressional obsession with jackbooted federal regulators, your teenager can buy a dangerous but ``natural'' stimulant, in plentiful, legal, unregulated supply at any grunge club, head shop, convenience store or health food store.<ep>
   You've seen them. Next to the cash register. New Age/hippie packaging promising a 100 percent natural herbal vegetarian high. ``Synergistically blended to ensure visionary vibrations.''<ep>
   The stuff's marketed as Ecstasy or Herbal Ecstasy or Ultimate Xphoria or Cloud 9 or other names intimating the ultimate buzz. They're called ``safe and legal.''<ep>
   Legal. Not so safe. The pills contain ephedrine or ephedra, naturally occurring chemicals in an Asian herb called <m0>ma-huang  <m0>that, in teenage doses, can crank up blood pressure, stimulate the heart and wreak havoc with the central nervous system. It can spawn seizures, psychotic fits and heart attacks.<ep>
<m1>We can thank Congress<ep>
<m0>   It's not that the Food and Drug Administration has shrugged off ephedrine. Under a 1994 law deregulating ``natural'' dietary supplements, the FDA can't interfere until ephedrine casualties stack up into a great pile of funereal evidence.<ep>
   Congress, in 1994, decreed that manufacturers of ``natural'' dietary supplements no longer need test their products or prove them safe. Now the onus is on the FDA to count the bodies and gather absolute proof before it can yank any ``natural'' supplement, no matter how loony, off the shelves.<ep>
   Last week, the FDA did all it legally could do to protect teenagers from ephedrine. It issued a warning, noting 15 deaths and 400 other cases of adverse reactions to the pills.<ep>
   On Tuesday, Nassau County, N.Y., circumvented the right-wing lunatics running Congress. After news that a local college student died after taking eight ephedrine pills while on spring break in Florida, Nassau County banned the stuff.<ep>
   The state of Ohio also has banned ephedrine. Florida, of course, remains in an unregulated herbal ecstasy.<ql>
<m1>An exotic blend<ep>
<m0>   I paid, not very ecstatically, $19.95 for 10 blue Herbal Ecstasy pills, each slightly larger than an aspirin, each said to be ``100 percent natural, a synergistic blend of exotic botanicals.'' With an ingredients list out of National Geographic (--) wild Tibetan <m0>ma-huang, <m0>rare Brazilian <m0>guarana, <m0>Chinese black ginseng, African raw cola nut, Russian <m0>gotu-kola, <m0>Indonesian wild <m0>fo-ti-tieng, <m0>Chinese green tea extract and <m0>rou gui, <m0>which was described as ``a rare form of Chinese nutmeg.''<ep>
   At the Fort Lauderdale Bread of Life health food store, Herbal Ecstasy, in those fancy pyramid-shaped boxes, are so coveted by shoplifters that the pills are kept behind the counter, said store nutritionist Aaron Chadwick, who confessed misgivings about its marketing claims. Chadwick said he warns customers that large doses of <m0>ma-huang  <m0>can raise blood pressure and cause heart palpitations.<ep>
   The problem, of course, is that most people peddling this particular high lack either the ethics or knowledge of Aaron Chadwick. Most kids buying the <m0>ma-huang  <m0>have no idea that the FDA, the state of Ohio and Nassau County, N.Y., think they're flirting with death.<ep>
   Most of us assume that pills sold over store counters come with the tacit approval of the FDA.<ep>
   But, of course, we owe 100 percent vegetarian ephedrine, and 15 all-natural deaths, to the congressional demagogues who got the damned FDA off our backs.<ql>
