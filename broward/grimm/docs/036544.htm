   Homeowner: ``Good gracious . . . another blast. Nearly dislodged my false teeth. Had to be a 7 on the Richter scale. I haven't felt the earth move like that since Kathy Willets retired.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   Broward County official: ``Blast? What blast? I didn't hear nothing. You hear something?''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   Independent (?) seismologist: ``Nothing. And even if I did hear something, it was definitely within the strict standards set by county law.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   Developer: ``The only thing I heard was another pathetic homeowner making a groundless complaint against conscientious builders raising affordable new homes to meet the needs of working Americans.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   Homeowner: ``But it shook the house. Look, a new crack in my Grecian tile foyer. Another chunk of plaster fell out of the Romanesque ceiling. My California-style hot tub is spewing like a Yellowstone geyser. And my mother-in-law tumbled down the English manor stairs into the Spanish sunken living room.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   County official: ``Cracks. What cracks? What hot tub? What mother-in-law? I acknowledge no mother-in-law.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   Homeowner: ``Actually, you're standing on her head.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   (Not very) independent seismologist: ``I have to tell you, Mr. Homemaker, that even if there was a blast -- I admit no relationship between the lawful, necessary explosive excavations carried out by Broward's responsible developer community and a few petty, cosmetic flaws in your home. As an independent monitor, I've investigated more than 1,000 citizen complaints in southwest Broward since 1990 and have yet to attribute a single cracked window pane to blasting.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   Homeowner: ``Maybe that's because the developers doing the blasting all hire the same independent seismologist?''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   Developer: ``What about the people of Sarajevo? Do they whimper about blasting and hairline cracks in their porticoes? You should be ashamed.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   Homeowner: ``The Serbs will make war retributions before Broward developers reimburse homeowners for blasting damage.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   County official: ``Huh? My records indicate no residential blasting damage in a Sarajevo subdivision.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   (So-called) independent seismologist: ``Me neither. No Sarajevo explosions registered on my official Blast-O-Meter. Definitely within the county's strict legal limits.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   Homeowner: ``How can a citizen expect justice in a system in which the seismologist owes his livelihood to the developer? What chance does some lowly homeowner have in a county that hasn't revoked a single blasting permit -- despite scores of violations -- since 1991?''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   County official: ``I like to point out to this peon that, on several occasions, we've given strong consideration to issuing admonishments for excessive blasting. Not that we're acknowledging excessive blasting. But if there had been excessive blasting, we'd issue a really, really stern admonishment.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   Developer: ``Look, homeowner, you were warned when you moved here that southwest Broward was a big boom town. So it's booming.''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   (Un) independent seismologist: ``Boom town? What boom? Not me. I didn't hear nothing?''<BR>
<BR>
<P>

   County official: Must have been thunder? Must have been the mother-in-law bouncing down those stairs.<P>

<BR>
