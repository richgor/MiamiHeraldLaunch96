<m0>   Alfreda Robinson and her daughter Angela spent two years as a team at Nova Southeastern University.<ep>
   They crammed at the library, shared lecture notes, helped each other with projects and boosted each other's spirits.<ep>
   Sunday marked one last bit of teamwork: The two Robinsons, in gowns and mortarboards, received their bachelor's degrees in elementary education during Nova Southeastern's commencement ceremony.<ep>
   ``We were a big encouragement to each other,'' said Angela, 23, who graduated from Homestead High School. She plans to get her master's degree.<ep>
   ``She had confidence in me and I had confidence in her,'' said Alfreda Robinson, 47, who started taking classes at Miami-Dade Community College in 1989. Family and work intervened, but she eventually earned her associate's degree and enrolled at Nova Southeastern in 1994.<ep>
   ``The kids at the school, they treated me with such great respect,'' she said. ``They made me feel like I was part of the group from day one.''<ep>
   The graduation ceremony at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts honored 1,265 students. The graduates craned their necks searching for family and friends, who stood up to cheer and take pictures as their students marched in.<ep>
   Many of the graduates had returned to college after being in the workplace for several years.<ep>
   ``It's not really easy, between working full time and family and school,'' said Charles Anderson, 31, a business administration major from Plantation. ``You learn to sleep a little less.''<ep>
   Owen Huntley, a pre-law major from Fort Lauderdale, wants to become a U.S. ambassador. He has already been picked as a delegate at the Democratic National Convention this summer. Nova Southeastern was a great place to start his studies, he said.<ep>
   ``Nova is a well-known status figure abroad,'' said Huntley, 22. ``More people in the United States are recognizing us, slowly but surely.''<ep>
   Millard Fuller, founder of Habitat for Humanity, was the commencement speaker. Habitat for Humanity, which provides low-cost houses for lower-income families, recently kicked off a building drive in Davie. Volunteers will try to build 10 houses in six days.<ep>
   Fuller told the graduates <m1> <m0>his group is striving to eliminate all substandard housing in Americus, Ga., where the organization is based. Even though experts presented facts to Fuller that claimed he could never eliminate slums, he wasn't dissuaded.<ep>
   ``By the year 2000 we will achieve what seemed impossible five years ago,'' Fuller said. ``I encourage you not to impose limitations on yourself. Determine now on this happy day of graduation that you will never be defeated by the `facts.' ''<ep>
