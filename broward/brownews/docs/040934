<m0>  A developer who wants to build 640 homes in western Pembroke Pines could learn as soon as next week whether it can use blasting to prepare the site.<ep>
   The City Commission is scheduled to review a request from Levitt Homes to blast on 320 acres south of Pines Boulevard between Southwest 184th and 196th avenues.<ep>
   But Levitt may have a tough time getting approval from commissioners, who are cautious after hearing hundreds of homeowners complain that blasting has damaged their homes, cracking walls and tiles.<ep>
   Mayor Alex Fekete said Thursday he would vote to deny Levitt's request.<ep>
   ``I believe they are too close to the residential community to be allowed to blast,'' Fekete said. ``When blasting started in 1990 in the rural area, there were no homes. The conditions have changed.''<ep>
   Commissioner Ben Fiorendino has heard enough complaints from homeowners to believe blasting can damage homes (--) despite engineers who say it does not.<ep>
   ``To a degree, it does cause damage. We have to be careful where blasting will be permitted. We need to look at all the ramifications,'' Fiorendino said. He said he was wary of approving the permit, but realized developers have rights, too.<ep>
   Dennis Mele, attorney for Levitt Homes, could not be reached for comment Thursday.<ep>
   In December, commissioners tabled a vote on the blasting application, saying they wanted to apply stronger restrictions on the developer, then Atlantic Gulf Communities. The company later sold the land to Levitt Homes.<ep>
   The commission limited the underground shock waves and above-ground air blasts and decided to review each application instead of relying solely on the city engineer to issue a permit.<ep>
   The city then hired an Alabama seismic engineering firm to review additional restrictions such as prohibiting blasting within one mile of the nearest buildings, requiring a pre-blast survey within a 1 1/2-mile radius of the site and hiring an independent seismologist to monitor the explosions.<ep>
   In an eight-page report, Sauls Engineers said the city's rules were a bit too restrictive. Sauls President S. McRoy Sauls warned the commission it could lose a court battle over the restrictions.<ep>
   The city eventually hired arbitrators to resolve disputes between homeowners and developers over blasting damage.<ep>
   Pines resident Graham Hitchen doesn't like the idea of more blasting. He and his family moved to Chapel Trail three years ago and have been shaken by the explosions.<ep>
   ``I know the builder is in business, too. But they do have to be sensitive to the fact that there are homes all around. The stakes are much higher,'' Hitchen said. ``I'm sure we would all rather it not be done.''<ql>
