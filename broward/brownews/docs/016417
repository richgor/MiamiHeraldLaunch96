<m0>  Two Hollywood youths who allegedly returned to the scene of a crime in Lauderhill have been charged with burglary, police said.<ep>
   Police said the juveniles, 14 and 15 years old, along with a third suspect who got away, tried to steal a truckload of sound equipment about 2:54 a.m. Thursday in the 2000 block of Northwest 46th Avenue.<ep>
   Before the burglars were able to make off with the equipment, the truck's alarm sounded. The owner ran from a nearby apartment in time to stop the burglary and get a description of the suspects and the vehicle they were driving.<ep>
   Suspecting that the burglars would return to finish the job, Lauderhill police officer Richard Dostie parked his patrol car out of sight. Within minutes, a dark Toyota matching the description provided by the truck owner pulled up behind the truck.<ep>
   When three males got out of the car, Dostie approached them.<ep>
   Though the unidentified driver ran, the other two suspects were detained and charged. Police said they also recovered stolen property from the Toyota.<ql>
