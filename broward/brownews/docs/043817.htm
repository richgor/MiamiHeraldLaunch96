  Fearful that ethnic tensions are approaching explosive levels at several Broward County schools, a group of concerned residents and parents say they plan to ask school officials this week for more cultural sensitivity in the classroom.<P>

   During a community/youth summit Saturday at Fort Lauderdale High School, members of the Multiethnic Education Coalition (MEEC) said school administrators need to know how to properly respond to tensions between Haitian, Jamaican and African-Americans students.<P>

   Blaming the tensions on a lack of cultural knowledge and perceived societal stereotypes about the various groups, MECC members said the district has to begin educating its students and staff members about the different groups.<P>

   ``This problem has existed for the past 16 years,'' said MEEC co-chairwoman and school social worker Janice Boursiquot. ``We've been asking for something like this for the past 12 years and still there is no overall plan to address issues of cultural diversity and ethnic confrontation.''<P>

   MECC's request will not be the first.<P>

   As part of a group of reforms proposed to settle a 1995 lawsuit filed by the activists group Citizens Concerned About Our Children against the School Board, CCC members two months ago also asked the district to create cultural sensitive programs.<P>

   Although School Board members and attorneys are still waiting to meet with CCC members and attorneys about the reforms, School Board Chairwoman Lois Wexler said the district is already working on creating some kind of cultural sensitivity program.<P>

   ``This is a problem that has been festering for too long,'' said Wexler, conceding that the tensions are not just at schools like Sunrise Middle and Fort Lauderdale High schools, but all over the district. ``We need to be able to teach people and administrators that different isn't something to be afraid of or make fun of.''<P>

   MEEC public relations chairman Bernie Kemp said while he was somewhat disappointed that only 30 adults and students showed up Saturday, the group will continue to sponsor community forums on the issue. In addition to taking its fight to the classrooms, MECC also plans to take its message to the community via churches and homeowners groups.<P>

   ``We need to get people sensitive to the issues,'' said Kemp, who works at Sunrise Middle School. ``It would be nice if we could be one group of people, but until we address the key problem among our youths, that won't happen.''
