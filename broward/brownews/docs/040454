<m0>   Six teens in a stolen car were injured Monday when their car slammed into a tree, a Broward Sheriff's Office spokesman said.<ep>
   The incident started about 9:45 a.m. when BSO deputy Chris Schuab was parked in the 4500 block of Southwest 45th Street in unincorporated Broward near the Dade County line. Using a radar gun, he clocked a white 1992 Grand Prix doing 63 in a 35-mile-per-hour zone, BSO spokesman Jim Leljedal said.<ep>
   Schuab went after the car, planning to give the driver a speeding ticket. At Southwest 52nd Avenue, the car ran a red light and sped south into Dade County, Leljedal said.<ep>
   ``He didn't know it was a stolen <m2><ql>

<m0>vehicle,'' said deputy Jay Fernandez. ``The car was traveling at a high rate of speed. He was attempting to make a traffic stop. As soon as they started to take off, he [Schuab] backed off right away. We are prohibited by policy from chasing vehicles unless it's a violent felony.''<ep>
   The deputy was a quarter of a mile back when the car took a sharp right turn on Sutton Road. The car missed the street and rammed into a tree on a hill near a small strip mall, leaving skid marks on the road.<ep>
   ``The car lost control in the middle of 441,'' said Roger Hall, owner of Car Clean, a carwash at the intersection of Sutton and U.S. 441. Hall saw the accident.<ep>
   Hall said police did not use their flashing lights until they arrived at the scene.<ep>
   Cynthia Stripling of Miami was having her Honda Accord washed at Car Clean when she saw the Pontiac heading in her direction.<ep>
   ``Had this tree not been here, we would have been hit,'' she said.<ep>
   Jose Cartagena said there have been several accidents at the intersection of U.S. 441 and Sutton. He said the intersection desperately needs a stoplight.<ep>
   The driver of the car, Romelio Rodriguez, 18, of 5612 SW 36th Ct. in Hollywood, was trapped inside. A passenger, identified as Nimrod Arauz, 15, fled the accident scene on foot but police picked him up a short time later.<ep>
   Four girls who were in the back of the car stayed there until paramedics arrived. Lydia Ramos, 18, Barbara Lara, 16, Zunilda De Los Santos, 16, and Yannaris Rodriguez, 16, all of Hollywood, were treated for minor injuries, Leljedal said.<ep>
   When the five teens were removed from the car, the only evidence of their joy ride that remained was a white Fila sneaker on the gas pedal and a gold hoop earring on the ground beside the Pontiac's crumpled frame.<ep>
   Police said this was not the first alleged car theft for Rodriguez (--) who is just over five feet tall and weighs just under 100 pounds.<ep>
   ``He's been arrested in the past for auto theft,'' said deputy Rick Libman, who arrived on the scene. ``He's notorious.''<ep>
   Court files show one arrest for grand theft, but arrests prior to his 18th birthday may not appear in court records.<ep>
   The white Grand Prix is registered to Carl Heluig, 81, of Hollywood, according to state motor vehicle records. It was reported stolen from Lake Forrest early Monday.<ep>
   Rodriguez, who remained hospitalized Monday night with a broken left leg, was charged with grand theft auto, speeding, driving without a license and running a red light.<ql>
