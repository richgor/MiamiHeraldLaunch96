   A few miles from the Magic Kingdom, the magic schoolyard is taking root -- a stately campus designed by a renowned architect, with innovative curriculum created by national experts and technology that any school would envy.<P>

   Welcome to the Celebration School, Disney's grand venture into education.<P>

   A public school with the trappings of a private one, the Celebration School is the most striking example of developers' growing involvement in public education, a sometimes-strained marriage between cash-starved school districts and builders who know that good schools sell homes.<P>

   The idea already resounds in South Florida.<P>

   Early Saturday morning, the state Legislature approved a budget with $270,000 for a kindergarten and teen center in Weston, a controversial deal made after the developer and a community foundation pledged to contribute the rest. In northwest and southwest Dade County, a handful of developers have promised to build several primary learning centers -- for kindergartners and first-graders -- in their communities.<P>

   Although most developers, especially small ones, would prefer to stay out of the education business, some feel they've got to pitch in where school systems have fallen short.<P>

   ``It's very difficult to get people to move into a new community if they don't have a neighborhood school,'' said Charles Adams of Disney's Celebration Company, which is developing the town of Celebration in Osceola County.<P>

   ``People see their children bused to schools all over Osceola County,'' Adams said. ``We wanted to ensure that children would be able to go to school in Celebration and that this school would be as good if not better as the best in central Florida.''<P>

   But what about families who live outside a development's gates? Evan McKenzie, author of a book on private communities called Privatopia  (Yale University Press), says the cost is high -- growing separation between rich and poor, and public policy decisions intended to boost corporate profits instead of community welfare.<P>

   ``Cities and school districts are entering a Faustian bargain with developers,'' said McKenzie, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ``Everything we have known that was public and shared is being privatized -- and we end up with more and more of our lives controlled by corporations.''<P>

<BR>

   Broward County Schools Superintendent Frank Petruzielo is incensed by the state Legislature's appropriation for the Weston kindergarten and community center, a project pushed by Weston developer Arvida/JMB Partners. The deal does not give Broward any additional money. It merely earmarks $270,000 of Broward's share of state funds for class-size reduction for this one project.<P>

   So in this shotgun marriage of public and private, the Broward school system is a reluctant bride. Without Arvida's donation, Broward probably would have used the state money to hire teacher aides in Weston and elsewhere -- a strategy commonly used to deal with large classes.<P>

   Now the district won't have that option. Plans for the Weston project went through with little discussion of what the school system needs most, Petruzielo said.<P>

   ``What is extraordinary to me -- and it looks too good to the public -- is the inequity in this,'' Petruzielo said. ``These are dollars that should have been coming to the School Board for its use and discretion, looking at all the district's needs. Now it's been taken out of the pot and earmarked for one specific project in one specific community.<P>

   ``Why wouldn't any other community want its fair share?''<P>

<BR>

   Others involved in the deal see it differently. They can't understand why any administrator would want to reject a corporate gift that could save children from double sessions.<P>

   ``Here you're getting a $1 million facility for $270,000 in public expense,'' said state Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Davie, who got the project into the state budget. ``Whenever we have an opportunity for any area to reduce overcrowding, we should take advantage of it.''<P>

   This is not Arvida's first venture into public education. Last year, Arvida hired John Murphy, former schools superintendent in Charlotte, N.C., to advise on educational issues in all the company's communities. Murphy is now meeting with parents, said George C. Yeonas, Arvida's vice president and general manager.<P>

   ``Our goal is to make sure every child in Weston has access to a world-class education,'' Yeonas said. ``We're trying to work with the school district and give them something they wouldn't otherwise have.''<P>

<BR>

   For school administrators, the best kind of developer involvement comes with no strings attached.<P>

   Petruzielo: ``I, for one, will not be a party to things that on the surface are alleged to be partnerships but are in effect strategies for improving public relations or increasing profits.''<P>

   The Dade developers who agreed to build the primary centers will get a break in their impact fees but will turn over the buildings to the school board and will play no part in running them.<P>

   ``The developers' interest is getting past the zoning boards, and we're always an obstacle,'' said Alan Olkes, the Dade district's chief of staff. ``If we can work out a deal, it's good for us and it's good for them.''<P>

   The same logic was at work in Broward, where Davie developer Walter Collins recently agreed to contribute six portable classrooms to add seats at Silver Ridge Elementary School -- a gain for the district, free and clear. That concession won county approval for Collins' housing construction plans.<P>

<BR>

   In Celebration, designed to conjure up a gracious Southern lifestyle, the school will sit just off Main Street, facing the Town Common. For $127,000 and up, homeowners -- who will begin moving in this July -- have bought the dream of a lost America: tree-lined streets, houses with front porches, a dignified downtown within walking distance.<P>

   And a school unlike any in the Osceola district.<P>

   Osceola's gains are unmistakable. Disney donated 35 acres. It hired and paid Boston architects William Rawn Associates, well known for planning educational institutions. It threw in $5 million for an ``enhancement fund,'' paid top consultants to design a curriculum using the most innovative strategies from across the country and promised to train other Osceola teachers at a Disney-built Teaching Academy next door.<P>

   When bids came in $8 million higher than the $14.6 million the School Board had budgeted for construction, Disney stepped in, offering to build the field house, playing fields, tennis courts and other facilities.<P>

   But the arrangement gives Disney a strong voice in decisions that most school boards prefer to make themselves.<P>

   The board's 20-year contract provides 20 percent of the seats for non-Celebration students -- but provides an option for Disney to expand capacity so all Celebration kids can attend.<P>

   If the School Board refuses? That's grounds for divorce, a complicated process, to be sure.<P>

<BR>

   Disney may test commercial products at the school. It must consent if the School Board wants to bring in portables. It holds one seat on the three-member Board of Trustees, which makes recommendations on everything from staffing to curriculum.<P>

   ``They are calling the shots,'' said Martha Anderson, the only Osceola School Board member to oppose the Celebration contract. ``It's an advise-and-consent arrangement. What that means is they advise and we consent.''<P>

   ``I have always viewed our school system as a family, and every school is a part of that family,'' Anderson said. ``So when you find one member of the family that becomes the -- shall I say -- the princess, it makes everyone else feel like the red-haired stepchildren.''<P>

   The enhancements at Celebration will ``trickle down'' to other district schools, because teachers from across the county will be exposed to its work, said Judy Robertson, Osceola's School Board chairwoman.<P>

   ``Every school has business partners,'' she said. ``This school just has a super business partner.''<P>

<BR>

   Across the state, educators and developers are surveying the partnerships with mixed emotions. The trend could get a big boost if a Broward proposal to link housing construction and classroom space gets approval, as expected, by November.<P>

   ``We have no problem with paying our fair share for schools,'' said Tony Martin, chairman of the Tallahassee-based Florida Homebuilders Association's education committee. ``We pay impact fees. We make donations of land. The problem is some people define our fair share differently than we do.''<P>

   Wayne Blanton, head of the Florida School Boards Association, admires the Celebration contract and encourages other partnerships, saying they show ``the ultimate in local control.''<P>

   So far, no one knows how the new partnerships will play out -- whether school boards and taxpayers will win or lose in the bargain. In the long run, the schools might cost more.<P>

   A Dade task force last year found that schools built and leased back to the school board -- another option -- could cost twice as much over 20 years than they would under the traditional system.<P>

   ``There's absolutely no question this kind of thing will grow,'' said University of Florida Professor Craig Wood, who specializes in education finance. ``To question one of these things is to question motherhood, apple pie and the American flag.<P>

   ``It's always presented to the taxpayer as a win-win situation, but the truth is there is no way to know the long-term costs,'' he said. ``And those questions rarely get asked -- because there's so much political pressure to take the deal.''
