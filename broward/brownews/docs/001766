  From poolside condos to the governor's mansion, Russell Barakat's conviction unleashed a range of emotions among Democrats on Monday (--) from surprise to anger to hard-boiled talk about the possible effects on the president's re-election.<ep>
  ``I was saddened and surprised to hear the news of Russ' conviction,'' Gov. Lawton Chiles said through a spokeswoman. ``Russ has been a friend for many years, and I am sure this is a very tough time for him and his family.''<ep>
  Party leaders called the verdict a personal and political tragedy for Barakat, but they said it won't stop one of the most successful and resilient Democratic machines in the United States from victory this fall.<ep>
<m0>Loyal friends<ep>
<m0>   Some Democrats fear Barakat's conviction could further blemish the image of politics in Broward, where in recent years a congressman, port commissioner and one of Barakat's successors all went to prison.<ep>
  ``Obviously, the conviction of the party leader doesn't help the image of the party,'' said Mitchell Berger, a Fort Lauderdale lawyer and state party finance chairman. ``But Russ Barakat's career should not be seen from that vantage point. He has spent his entire life getting people involved in the political process.''<ep>
  Barakat commands so much loyalty that some Democratic activists didn't see anything wrong with a convicted felon continuing to direct party operations in an election year. They said he should only resign if he wants to, and said he should handpick his replacement.<ep>
  He has Republican friends, too: U.S. Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. testified as a character witness at his trial, and Broward GOP chairman Lew Keller said it would be wrong to use the conviction for political gain this fall. Broward needs a two-party system, Keller said, ``but we're not going to do it on a basis of one Democrat having legal problems.''<ep>
  Barakat's resignation as chairman after eight years seems inevitable: As a convicted felon, he automatically loses his voting rights, and only voters can be members of Broward's Democratic Executive Committee.<ep>
  His $93,000-a-year job directing a federally-funded public-housing agency, the Broward County Housing Authority, also is in jeopardy.<ep>
<m0>A party man<ep>
<m0>   The housing job, though full time, allowed Barakat to work the phones constantly on political matters, from influencing the appointment of a judge to finding donors for a presidential fund-raiser.<ep>
  ``This is a big loss,'' said Larry Davis, a Hollywood lawyer and long-time party activist. <m1> <m0>``Whether you liked him or not he was constantly on the job, constantly raising money. Every waking moment of Russ Barakat's life was spent working on party matters.''<ep>
  Fortunately for Democrats, Barakat's conviction comes at a time when the party's dominance of local politics is virtually unchallenged. The Democrats control all 14 School Board and County Commission seats and 16 of 18 seats in the Legislature. Only a few Democratic incumbents face serious opposition this fall.<ep>
   If Barakat resigns, first-vice chair Gloria Jackson, an educator and the party's highest-ranking African American, would become acting chair. Under party bylaws, a special party election would be called within 45 days. The party's rank and file members would elect a chairman until November, when Barakat's term would have expired.<ep>
