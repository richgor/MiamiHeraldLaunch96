<m0> Hollywood City Manager Sam Finz put the private company handling the city's water billing on notice Wednesday to fix billing errors and problems that have plagued the system.<ep>
   Some city residents have received erroneous monthly water bills for as much as $75,000 in the past several days. Bills that normally average $30 or $40 have been mailed out showing $9,000 as the amount due.<ep>
   ``There's no more room for error anymore,'' Finz told city commissioners, who brought up the billing errors during his annual evaluation Wednesday.<ep>
   He said the problem is twofold: Meter readers for the contractor, Data Management Associates, are logging incorrect readings and workers are failing to pull bills for unrealistically large amounts.<ep>
   A computer program automatically spits out bills that increase more than a certain percentage each month. But DMA staffers mistakenly let many go through without checking them.<ep>
   ``The issue here is human error (--) human error in the field and in the billing office,'' Finz said.<ep>
   DMA President Tony Soviero took responsibility for the problems in a memo to Finz on Wednesday and promised quick action. The company uses the city's computers for billing and normally processes 3,000 bills a day.<ep>
   But when technicians were making backup files on the city's computer last month, it caused 10 days of delays. DMA then had to send out 65,000 bills in a three-week period.<ep>
   Soviero promised to implement a series of steps within the next several days to correct the problems.<ep>
   The company's five-year, $8.1 million contract began Feb. 1 with a six-month trial period. Finz said that if improvements aren't made by the end of the trial, the city will consider re-evaluating the contract.<ql>
