  In Pembroke Pines, newspapers like this one get recycled but aluminum cans, plastic and glass bottles get tossed away and land in the dump.<P>

   Hoping to revive the city's struggling recycling program, city officials plan to meet today with representatives from BFI, the city's garbage hauler, to negotiate a curbside collection program.<P>

   Proposed is a program in which single-family homeowners -- in addition to the newspapers they already recycle -- would separate aluminum, plastic, glass and other recyclables from other garbage. BFI would collect the recyclables at least once a week on a normal garbage pickup day, said Mayor Alex Fekete.<P>

   Still to be worked out: what the city would pay BFI to collect recyclables. The county pays $22 a ton and the city would likely pay a similar fee, said Dan Pavone, BFI's marketing director.<P>

   The city's effort to increase recycling is welcome news to some residents who have been wondering why single-family homeowners in Pines recycle only a small part of their garbage.<P>

   Hollywood, for example, has finally launched a curbside recycling program for its 30,000 single-family homeowners and began handing bins out last week.<P>

   ``It's a shame we don't do it,'' said Pembroke Pines resident Fernando Bautista. ``If everybody does it together it will make a difference.''<P>

   In December, all efforts in Pembroke Pines to recycle anything but newspaper stopped because Waste Management Inc., which handled the city's recycling, needed to make room for new equipment at its plant.<P>

   BFI's proposal to recycle in Pines is similar to programs the company has in Miramar and Cooper City. Recyclables collected there are taken to the county's recycling facility in Davie, where they are separated along with recyclables from other Broward cities. The county then sells the recyclables and splits the revenues with the cities.<P>

   ``It's the right the thing to do. If we make money it's even righter,'' Fekete said.<P>

   A city's share of the revenues depends on the amount of recyclables collected. Sunrise, for example, received between $93,900 and $140,000 for different three-month periods in 1994 and 1995.<P>

   ``The word revenue really makes me light up,'' said City Manager Charles Dodge.<P>

   Pines has struggled to keep its program alive since November 1992, when Reuter Recycling, 20701 Pembroke Rd., halted composting efforts. The city had contracted Reuter to sift through garbage, separate recyclables and turn the rest into compost.<P>

   But composting stunk -- literally -- and neighbors complained, forcing the plant to stop the smelly process.<P>

   Waste Management Inc. bought Reuter in 1995 and agreed to keep recycling only newspapers and not to compost. But the amount has been so small it has made no difference in Broward's overall recycling efforts, county recycling officials have said.<P>

   Pembroke Pines recycling counts started dropping last year: In May, Reuter processed 466 tons, an amount on par with most cities. In December, Reuter recycled only 112 tons.<P>

   Pines residents say they won't mind sorting recyclables. ``Recycling is worth the trouble,'' said Gen Greenwall. ``We moved out here two years ago. This is our new life. We want to do everything right.''
