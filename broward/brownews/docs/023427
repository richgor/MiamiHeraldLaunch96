<m0>   If Fort Lauderdale can't have a $212 million hockey arena, nobody should, declared the city's mayor and commission as they agreed to explore legal options for stopping the project from rising in Sunrise.<ep>
   Sore losers? <ep>
   It's not that Mayor Jim Naugle believes he could lure the project back to Fort Lauderdale after the county rejected the city's site last month. He also acknowledges the city might not have much of a legal case.<ep>
   But he hopes that if he delays the project so it can't be built in time for the 1998 season, team owner H. Wayne Huizenga may move the Panthers out of South Florida.<ep>
   ``Just the delay could stop it,'' says Naugle, who complains that when the County Commission voted to build the arena in Sunrise, it violated its own policies calling for redevelopment in the east to stem urban sprawl out west. <ep>
   ``My fight is not with Sunrise . . . Someone has to be willing to say to county government, `You're not following the rules.' They're just paying lip service,'' Naugle said. ``How can they let one man decide how to spend our money? It's wrong.''<ep>
   Fort Lauderdale city commissioners on Tuesday asked their attorneys to look for legal ways to block the project.<ep>
   County officials say the city's premise is wrong. They say the Sunrise site near Sawgrass Mills mall already has all the necessary approvals for development of more than 2 million square feet of industrial and commercial space, and 500 hotel rooms. <ep>
   And because developers have already built on nearby property, the project doesn't meet the legal definition of urban sprawl, said Mike Wanchick, director of the county's department of Strategic Planning and Growth Management.<ep>
   The time to make the argument against the spread of urban sprawl is long past (--) by state law it should have been done before any development on the site was approved, said Carolyn Dekle, executive director of the South Florida Regional Planning Council.<ep>
   And because the project has no direct impact on Fort Lauderdale, the city may have no legal grounds to appeal.<ep>
   ``They have no standing that I'm aware of,'' said Dekle. ``I don't know what their venue of appeal would be.''<ep>
   Taking the case to court carries the risk of losing and having to pay attorneys' fees for their opponents.<ep>
   Panthers officials were clearly unhappy with the city's decision.<ep>
   ``I don't think throwing roadblocks in the way of a project that's obviously making progress would serve the goal of keeping the Panthers in South Florida,'' said Huizenga spokesman Stan Smith.<ep>
   County officials say they're taking a wait-and-see approach because the city hasn't done anything yet. But they acknowledge the city could make trouble for the project. Commission chairman John Rodstrom worries that a lawsuit could put a cloud on the sale of the bonds needed for the arena (--) perhaps enough to raise interest rates and cost the county some money.<ep>
   ``I can't see why they'd do this, for the life of me,'' said Rodstrom. ``Why would you want to keep Broward County from having an arena? What good can come out of it?''<ql>
