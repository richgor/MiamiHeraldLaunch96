`K2' has nothing to do with school terminology; the plan is named after the world's second-largest mountain. It could also stand for financial problems the program must scale to become a reality.<ql>

<m0>  Debbie Wasserman Schultz: Your name is mud in parts of Pembroke Pines.<ep>
   And now would not be the time to ask the School Board for a favor.<ep>
   Wasserman Schultz, a state representative whose district includes a wide swath of West Broward, was the architect of a plan to use $270,000 of lottery funds (--) earmarked to reduce classroom size (--) to build a kindergarten/teen center in Weston.<ep>
   By day, 5-year-olds from Country Isles Elementary would learn their ABCs there, averting the imposition of half-day kindergarten.<ep>
   Come midafternoon, middle school students from the K2 Project would make the place their own.<ep>
   But parents in western Pembroke Pines, whom Wasserman Schultz also represents, want to know why there was no plan for their kids.<ep>
   ``It's really nice what she did for Weston, now what is she going to do for us?'' asked Susan Meister, chairwoman of Chapel Trail Elementary's school advisory council. ``Our overcrowding is worse.''<ep>
   Wasserman Schultz says she pushed the Weston plan because Arvida, the Weston developer, was willing to kick in $465,000 for construction.<ep>
   ``Had this idea originated in Pembroke Pines, I would have gone to bat for them, too,'' she said Friday. ``I support any effort to reduce overcrowding.''<ep>
  But Wasserman Schultz also has angered School Board members, who feel she circumvented their authority and question how a facility could be built to house little kids and preteens.<ep>
  ``I have lots of questions and no answers,'' said School Board chairwoman Lois Wexler. ``But the biggest one is, `Am <m0>I<m0> ever going to get to vote yes or no on this?' ''<ql>

<m0>  Maybe not. The $270,000 appropriation, passed by the Legislature early Saturday, must be matched with $250,000 in private funds by Sept. 1.<ql>

<m0>   No problem, says Dee Scott Valdez, the force behind the proposed teen center, called the K2 Project. There's no money yet, but Valdez plans to raffle off a robot her students are building.<ep>
  The first thing you need to know about K2 is that it has nothing to do with elementary school.<ep>
   ``When Debbie called me about K2, I thought she was talking about kindergarten through second grade,'' said Diana Wasserman, the School Board member whose district covers Weston and Pembroke Pines.<ep>
   In fact, the project refers to K2, the world's second-tallest mountain (--) <m1> <m0>because the centerpiece of the center is to be a rock-climbing wall.<ep>
   But it could also refer to Valdez's uphill struggle to get the center built.<ep>
   The mother of two adolescents herself, Valdez began seeking support for an after-school program for Weston youngsters three years ago. She went to Arvida's Roy Rogers, who agreed to donate a band shell behind the Weston Athletic Club.<ep>
   A prominent architect drew plans to enclose and expand the band shell into a 7,500-square-foot building. His design included a computer lab, study hall, game room, offices, soda fountain, in-line skating rink, DJ booth and the climbing wall.<ep>
   After school, mostly volunteers would use the building to offer homework mentoring, art classes, a ``mad scientists'' club, a baby-sitting referral service, gardening and, of course, rock-climbing.<ep>
   She wrote an exhaustive business plan for the project, estimating it would cost $694,000 to build the facility.<ep>
   She projected a need for a staff of four, including a program director and a director of the nonprofit K2 Corp., who would earn $35,000 and $30,000 a year respectively. The second-year operating budget calls for the addition of a public relations director at a salary of $30,000 a year.<ep>
   To sustain the projected annual operating budget of $182,000, Valdez estimated she would need 600 members to pay between $200 and $400 in dues a year.<ep>
   Valdez says K2 has 30 to 50 members. Growth is stymied by the lack of a place to meet.<ep>
   ``We have a robotics class that has been meeting out of my garage for the last three months,'' Valdez said.<ep>
   Though no plans have been drawn, Valdez thinks the center could be reworked to accommodate kindergartners. She envisions round tables that could be rolled to storage in the afternoon, pull-down desks for teachers, blackboards on wheels.<ep>
   ``Ambitious,'' Superintendent Frank Petruzielo calls the plan.<ep>
   Unworkable, say Country Isles parents.<ep>
   ``Aren't these children going to have desks and chairs?'' asked Shelley Eichner, a Country Isles parent. ``Is somebody going to move those out each day and then move them back?''<ep>
   Administrators also questioned Valdez's cost estimates. Petruzielo said furnishings alone could run $400,000.<ep>
   Valdez still thinks there's room to negotiate.<ep>
   ``I care about Weston, so I said, `We'll try to accommodate this,' '' Valdez said. ``We aren't the bad guys. But we might be better off just waiting a year and raising our own money.''<ql>
