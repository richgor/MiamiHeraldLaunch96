<m0>   More than one in 10 Floridians drank tap water from utilities that violated federal health guidelines in the past two years, according to a report released Thursday by a coalition of environmental and consumer groups.<ep>
   Among those drinking that water were residents of Plantation, Miramar, Davie, Coral Springs and Wilton Manors, the report says.<ep>
   Regulators, public health officials and utility directors denied the report's implication that public drinking water is unsafe or unhealthy.<ep>
   ``This is ridiculous! Where are they getting their information from?'' said Tom Mueller, the engineer who monitors drinking water for the Broward Public Health Unit. ``We've had no violations. No bacterial outbreaks. No real problems.''<ep>
   The report by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group says that more than 45 million Americans drank water supplied by utilities that violated treatment standards since 1994. The report used data supplied by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.<ep>
   Environmentalists say the report shows the importance of maintaining high federal drinking water standards. Congress will soon consider legislation that environmentalists say would weaken the Safe Drinking Water Act.<ep>
   ``It is truly outrageous that with the number of health violations and the overwhelming public concern about the quality of our drinking water that the Congress would even consider proposals to weaken public health protections,'' said Beth Kidder of the Florida Public Interest Group, which released the report in Tallahassee.<ep>
   The Florida report shows that more than 1.8 million people in 957 Florida communities drank water from utilities that had a violation of the standard. There were also 96 schools, day-care centers and medical facilities that reported drinking water violations.<ep>
   Mel Entus, utilities director for Plantation, said the report was misleading, characterizing a single test result as indicative of bad water quality for an entire water supply.<ep>
   For example: The report says Plantation violated bacteria standards for a month in 1994. Entus said that one sample drawn at random from an outside tap of a single house that month exceeded the standard. Subsequent tests showed the bacteria did not come from the water system, he said.<ep>
   ``The fact of the matter is that the water people get out of the tap is safer than any of the water that people can buy off the supermarket shelf,'' Entus said.<ql>
