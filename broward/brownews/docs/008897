   <m0>(box) About 7 percent <m0>of these households have two or more kids.<ep>
   <m0>(box) More than half <m0>of the grandparents heading these households do not have a high school diploma. Only 1 percent of them have a four-year college degree.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Most <m0>of the families doing this are poor or somewhat poor.<ep>
   <m0>(box) More than two-thirds <m0>of Broward grandparents raising grandchildren earned less than the 1990 median Broward household income of $30,571. A third of the households had an income of less than $10,000. About one in four of the households had income above $40,000.<ep>
