<m0>   A Davie man lying face down on the ground waiting to be handcuffed was shot by a Hallandale police officer, apparently by accident.<ep>
   While Hallandale police had little to say about the incident, witnesses claimed Donnell Mitchell was unarmed and making no attempt to resist when he was shot in the buttocks by officer Marsha Roaden.<ep>
   The shooting led to a heated confrontation between police and residents.<ep>
   Mitchell, in his late 30s, was shot about 5:30 p.m. on Northwest Sixth Avenue, just north of Foster Road in Hallandale. He was treated and released to police custody Monday evening at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, a hospital spokesman said.<ep>
   Mitchell was on the ground and not resisting when the officer's handgun fired, said Karen Young, 31, of Hallandale.<ep>
   ``He didn't tussle or nothing. He was just laying face down,'' Young said. ``When she went to put the handcuff on his right arm, the gun went off. She never put the gun in the holster.''<ep>
   Mitchell was unarmed according to another witness, Shontavis Johnkins, 18, of Hallandale.<ep>
   ``The man had no knife or anything,'' she said. ``That woman was trying to handcuff the man with her gun out. He was not resisting.''<ep>
   Hallandale police spokeswoman Marcia Slow-Sandler agrees that Mitchell was shot while he was being handcuffed. But Slow-Sandler claimed that witnesses had told police before the shooting that Mitchell was armed with a knife. She said she did not know whether Mitchell was resisting the officer. Slow-Sandler said she does not believe the officer, who is a 13-year veteran, has ever been involved in a shooting before.<ep>
   The problem started when a group of people attacked Mitchell as he rode his bicycle along Northwest Sixth Avenue, Johnkins and Young said. Roaden, who was on routine patrol, drove toward the fight. The band of attackers spotted the officer and ran off, Johnkins and Young said. Then Roaden, with gun drawn, stopped Mitchell and ordered him to the ground, they said. As Roaden tried to handcuff him, her gun went off, they said.<ep>
   Mitchell was unarmed, Johnkins said. She pointed out that Mitchell did not use a weapon to defend himself against the gang that attacked him.<ep>
   Mitchell is living in Davie with his sister, Patricia Pittman. He had pedaled his bicycle from Davie to Hallandale on Monday because he was going to rent an apartment, Pittman said.<ep>
   Slow-Sandler briefly appeared at the scene. But her press conference was cut short by angry residents who denounced the police version of the shooting. That prompted a short confrontation between police and upset residents just outside the yellow crime-scene tape.<ep>
  ``You all must think we are stupid,'' shouted Barry Lewis of Hallandale. ``She shot him. There was no struggle at all.''<ep>
   Police officers crossed the tape and told the gathering crowd to get away.<ep>
   Police were out of line, said Lewis, who lives a block away from the shooting.<ep>
   ``I live here,'' Lewis said. ``How are you going to tell me to leave?''<ql>
