<m0>  People at risk will shun AIDS testing because of a proposed state policy, a group of medical workers and patients told White House officials Tuesday.<ep>
   A bill passed by the Legislature during the past session but not yet signed by the governor requires doctors to tell health authorities the names of people who test HIV-positive.<ep>
   Though the names are to be kept confidential, activists say strict anonymity is the only way to ensure that people at risk will feel safe getting the test. Some testing sites, like those at the Broward County Public Health Unit, will still allow anonymous testing.<ep>
   However, this bill is the first step to mandatory, nonconfidential tests, many said.<ep>
   ``The day we say you must have testing is the day the woman says, `I don't want to come here,' '' said Susan Widmayer, director of the Children's Diagnostic and Treatment Center in Fort Lauderdale. White House officials visited the center, at 417 S. Andrews Ave. in Fort Lauderdale.<ep>
   ``If they do mandatory testing, they will lose,'' said Evelyn Kendrick, a family resource assistant at the center. ``You cannot tell this younger generation that they have to do something.''<ep>
   Patricia Fleming, director of the Office of National AIDS Policy; Roberta Achtenberg, senior adviser to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and Dr. Joe O'Neill, associate administrator for AIDS at the Health Resources and Services Administration, were among federal officials at the center.<ep>
   O'Neill, who ran AIDS clinics in Baltimore before he began working for the government, said some legislators don't understand the mental state of those who are getting tested for HIV.<ep>
   ``If you haven't walked that walk, you're not going to understand that feeling and know that [mandatory testing] can drive people underground,'' he said.<ep>
   President Clinton is in favor of voluntary testing, said Jeremy Ben Ami, a deputy policy assistant who also visited the center.<ep>
   The White House officials will visit the Health Crisis Network and Center for Haitian Studies in Miami today.<ql>
