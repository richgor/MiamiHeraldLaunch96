<m0>  Karen Braverman has a one-word solution for crowding problems at her daughter's elementary school: Stuart.<ep>
   ``We lived there before and it was wonderful, like a small college town,'' said Braverman, as she sat at a cafeteria table at Country Isles Elementary in Weston, filling out kindergarten registration forms for Victoria, 5. ``If this keeps up, I'm going to have to move back.''<ep>
   Not everybody thinks moving north is the answer, but it's a truth-in-jest remark you hear these days in Southwest Broward.<ep>
   Braverman was one of about 100 Weston-area parents who came to their child's school early Tuesday to hear more about a new program most of them don't want: half-day kindergarten.<ep>
   ``I know this is not what you would have chosen,'' Principal Marci Smith told them. ``It's not what I would have chosen either.''<ep>
   But faced with the irreconcilable equation of ever-increasing numbers of students and steadily diminishing money to build, three elementary schools (--) Country Isles, Chapel Trail and Silver Palms (--) are being forced to reduce their offerings.<ep>
   Full-day kindergarten took the hit. In the fall, some kindergartners will go to class in the morning, others in the afternoon.<ep>
   Penny Tannenbaum saw the bright side:<ep>
   ``Full-day kindergarten is a little too long for them, anyway,'' she said. ``It'll all work out.''<ep>
   That's the approach Michele Balcerzak is recommending, too. She heads Silver Palms' school advisory committee.<ep>
   ``The kids will adjust,'' she says. ``It's the parents I worry about.''<ep>
   Silver Palms' building, in Pembroke Pines, is still under construction, but the school set up camp this year at a portable site in Cooper City.<ep>
   The school's attendance area covers one of the fastest-growing suburbs in the nation (--) a swath of Pembroke Pines and Miramar where about 25 families close on new homes each week.<ep>
   In January, Silver Palms (--) though not technically open yet (--) had to cap its enrollment because the portable site could not house any more students.<ep>
   Students who have moved into Silver Palms' attendance zone since January have been temporarily assigned to a different Pembroke Pines school (--) Pines Lakes Elementary. Since January, 120 new students have arrived (--) five classrooms worth.<ep>
   ``Whatever child comes in, we find a place somehow,'' said Ann Fee, Pines Lakes principal.<ep>
   Though the majority of parents who attended Tuesday's sessions understand the problem and seem grudgingly resigned to half-day kindergarten as a short-term solution, many worry that it is too little, too late.<ep>
   At Country Isles, parents wondered aloud: What are we getting into?<ep>
   ``What are they going to do for first grade? Second grade?'' asked Cindy Martin, parent of Joseph, 5. ``Is this going to follow him every year? It's frustrating. I bought out here for the schools.''<ep>
   Weston parents had hoped a proposed kindergarten/teen center would avert the need for half-day sessions, but the principal told them: Don't count on it. School district officials say it won't be built in time, if at all.<ep>
   Chapel Trail Elementary had about 250 parents show up for the first day of kindergarten registration.<ep>
   The principal had estimated a <m0>total <m0>kindergarten class of 250 to 300. Registration is open for three more months.<ql>
