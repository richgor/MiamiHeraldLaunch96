<m0>  Remove <m0>Russ Barakat <m0>as boss of Broward Democrats? Just because he's a convicted felon? No way, say precinct committee members (--) the people who put him in office and the ones with the power to remove him.<ep>
   Plantation Democratic Club President <m0>Bill Kling <m0>calls Barakat's failure to pay income taxes on nearly $10,000 an ``honest mistake'' and says: ``My feeling right now is, he stays until he makes a move. I just feel he got a raw deal.''<ep>
  <m0>Edith Morrison, <m0>president of the Sunrise Regular Democratic Club, says Barakat should stay put because ``he wasn't convicted of everything'' and he's appealing. ``I'll stick with Russ,'' she says. ``Unless he's removed by the governor, I'm perfectly satisfied with where he is now.''<ep>
  <m0>Unless he's removed by the governor.<m0> And it may take direct intervention from <m0>Lawton Chiles <m0>himself to convince Barakat that it's not in the party's best interest to be led by a convicted felon in an election year.<ep>
  For now, though, the rank and file seem unconvinced. Nobody seems to want Barakat as an enemy. Only a few party people are willingly calling for his head. Lawyers disagree whether he can still vote while appealing his conviction.<ep>
  Ever since Barakat's felony conviction Monday on an income-tax violation (he was acquitted on a mail fraud count), speculation has run rampant about who should replace him. Mentioned most often are lawyer-lobbyist <m0>Mitch Ceasar, <m0>Sunrise activist <m0>Barbara Effman, <m0>business executive <m0>Tom McDonald <m0>and party State Committeewoman <m0>Diane Glasser.<m0><ep>
   ``I think the vultures should stop trying to walk on his bones,'' said Century Village leader <m0>Amadeo ``Trinchi'' Trinchitella.<m0><ep>
  All the speculation seems to have had one obvious effect: It has made Barakat more determined than ever to stay on, at least until the party meets May 21. Barakat himself isn't speaking for the record. ``Come to the meeting,'' he says.<ep>
  His lawyer, <m0>Eddie Kay, <m0>says Barakat is not refusing to resign and that Barakat is willing to let party members decide whether he stays. But Barakat has dusted off a state party rule that requires a two-thirds vote of the county party membership (--) not just those attending (--) to remove a party officer. That makes an overthrow extremely unlikely. Barakat will have to be convinced to leave, and that hasn't happened.<ql>
<m0>Witness for the defense<ep>
<m0>  <m0>What you may have missed at the Barakat trial:<ep>
  (box) <m0>Ed Pozzuoli, <m0>a lawyer from Weston, had agreed to be a character witness for Barakat but didn't get a chance to testify. Not only is Pozzuoli a card-carrying Republican, he's the attorney for the Broward Republican Party. He served with Barakat on Broward's Community Health Purchasing Alliance (CHPA) board until Barakat resigned.<ep>
   ``I found him to be fair, and I found him to be a man of his word,'' said Pozzuoli, who worries that the case will discourage people from political involvement. ``It calls into question whether public service is worthwhile.''<ep>
  (box) Circuit Judge <m0>Robert Lance Andrews, <m0>a longtime friend of Barakat's, testified as a character witness at the trial. The rest of the story: Andrews' wife, <m0>Carole, <m0>is chairwoman of the board of the Broward County Housing Authority where Barakat is (--) for now (--) the executive director.<ep>
   Recalling those reprimands some other Broward judges got for writing letters on behalf of a convicted felon, Andrews emphasized he testified under subpoena and that's the end of his involvement. ``No, I won't write a letter for him,'' Andrews said.<ql>
<m0>Calling for a veto<ep>
<m0>   Civil liberties groups are mobilizing to lobby Gov. Lawton Chiles to veto the major education bill of the session because it contains a provision that allows prayer in school. The bill (HB 1041) passed in the final hours of the session and would allow voluntary student-led prayer at graduations and sporting events (--) if authorized by a School Board resolution.<ep>
  <m0>Carole Shields <m0>of Miami, president of the People for the American Way Action Fund, sent the governor a letter calling the prayer amendment both ``harmful'' and ``unnecessary'' because nothing prohibits a student from praying privately now. If Chiles lets the bill become law, Shields warned, ``costly and divisive litigation'' will be the only result.<ep>
  Interestingly, Broward's own Senate president, <m0>Jim Scott, <m0>doesn't see it that way. Explaining his vote for prayer, Scott, who's up for re-election in November, said: ``My philosophy is I like to keep government out of things, and I saw that, in the form it was in, that, basically, government should not be in this issue, and, therefore, we'll let the people voluntarily do it. But it's not something I'm crusading on or anything like that.''<ep>
  When the bill came up the last time, Broward senators were split. Scott and Democrats <m0>Ken Jenne <m0>and <m0>Matt Meadows <m0>voted yes, and Democrats <m0>Howard Forman, Peter Weinstein <m0>and <m0>Robert Wexler <m0>voted no.<ep>
   Jenne had voted against the prayer amendment itself earlier and against the bill previously. He argued against prayer in debate and said government-sanctioned prayer was ``offensive'' but that the overall bill had education reforms he favors. ``I was voting for the final package, and you can't pick and choose,'' Jenne said.<ql>
<m0>A switch in time<ep>
<m0>  Boca Raton inventor <m0>Peter James Tsakanikas <m0>says he has switched his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat in the race for the District 19 seat for Congress. Tsakanikas, who lost to U.S. Rep. <m0>Harry Johnston <m0>two years ago, will join <m0>Ben Graber, Peter Weinstein <m0>and <m0>Robert Wexler <m0>in the Democratic race, leaving Fort Lauderdale financial planner <m0>Beverly Kennedy <m0>alone on the Republican side.<ep>
  Tsakanikas said he switched back to the party he was in before 1970. He said he supports a higher minimum wage and caps on executives' pay, both of which he said most Republicans oppose.<ql>
