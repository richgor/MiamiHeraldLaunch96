   The most crowded elementary school in Broward this fall is not projected to be in Weston, Pembroke Pines or Coral Springs, though all three cities are well represented on the ``critically overcrowded'' list released Thursday by the school district.<ep>
   The winner of the dubious distinction as Broward's most crowded school when the bell rings in August probably will be Royal Palm Elementary in Lauderhill, a 25-year-old school in a neighborhood of humble bungalows just west of Florida's Turnpike.<ep>
   Surprised?<ep>
   Not everybody is. Homebuilders, for instance, have been complaining for years that the blame for Broward's classroom shortage has been unfairly laid at the door of all those new subdivisions west of Interstate 75.<ep>
   The list released Thursday bears them out:<ep>
   Of the 30 schools designated bursting-at-the-seams, nearly half are <m0>east<m0> of University Drive.<ep>
   Credit the end of forced busing, a wave of immigrants and a population boomlet that doesn't respect east-west Broward distinctions.<ep>
   ``In the old days if we had room in the east and growth in the west, you could talk about some kind of balancing act,'' Superintendent Frank Petruzielo said Thursday. ``Those days are over.''<ep>
   Every school in Weston also made the list, as did most of the schools serving western Pembroke Pines (--) including Silver Palms Elementary, which does not open until August.<ep>
   And despite the opening of a second middle school to serve west Pines this fall, Walter C. Young Middle School remained on the list because of the explosive growth in that area.<ep>
   ``We probably need a third middle school in that area tomorrow,'' Petruzielo said.<ep>
<m0>   Victims of success<ep>
<m0>   Magnet schools worked too well at some schools: The performing arts program at North Andrews Gardens Elementary, near Oakland Park, has contributed to that school's having nearly twice the number of students its building was designed to accommodate.<ep>
   Enrollment also will be up at Parkway Middle, another performing arts magnet, in part because of its inclusion in the ``controlled choice'' magnet program, a consortium of four eastern Broward middle schools. For the first time this year, students assigned to any one of the four could select which one they wanted to attend. More chose Parkway, near Fort Lauderdale, than any other.<ep>
   In all, the school district expects another 9,207 students to enroll this fall.<ep>
<m0>   Broward in the big time<ep>
<m0>   If so, Broward would move ahead of Philadelphia, becoming the fifth largest school district in the nation, behind only New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dade County.<ep>
   In addition to the 30 schools projected to be critically overcrowded, the school district identified another 18 that may go on the list. Petruzielo says many of the 18 are ``only two kids away'' from the critically overcrowded designation.<ep>
   ``The total number come fall is probably going to be a lot closer to 50,'' he said. This year, 25 schools were designated critically overcrowded.<ep>
   School Board policy dictates that critically overcrowded schools hold meetings for parents and staff to recommend solutions, which include double sessions, year-round education or enrollment capping.<ep>
   That process is what led to three schools this year being forced to reduce kindergarten instruction to half-day sessions, an unpopular choice but better than the alternative: double sessions for the entire school.<ep>
   Petruzielo is warning that alternatives to double sessions are dwindling.<ep>
   Enrollment capping, for instance, puts a ceiling on the number of students any one school would accept. But it only works when there is angther school nearby with empty seats.<ep>
   ``It's not as great a tool when the nearest school that is not critically overcrowded is miles and miles away,'' Petruzielo said.<ep>
<m0>   No more portables?<ep>
<m0>   Petruzielo has said in recent days that he will not endorse solutions that call for more portables, in part, because he believes they have hidden the problem.<ep>
   ``We have played into the problem by putting portables behind schools,'' Petruzielo told a group of developers Wednesday. ``We should have put them in the front yard.''<ep>
   Maybe Royal Palm Elementary has some room left in its front yard. Every other inch of the campus is getting cramped.<ep>
   The end of starbursting (--) the practice of busing black students from the same neighborhood to several different schools (--) will add several hundred students to its enrollment this fall.<ep>
   A boundary change requested by parents, whose children had to walk past Royal Palm to attend a school farther away, will add another 175.<ep>
<m0>   Population surging<ep>
<m0>   And the school serves an area that has drawn a wave of new immigrants. Principal Rebecca Dahl estimates nearly 35 percent of Royal Palm's students are Caribbean-born.<ep>
   ``We have a lot of households that have more than one family,'' she said.<ep>
   The situation is complicated by the school district's continuing inability to build a new elementary in Lauderhill. Plans for ``School X'' have been blocked by the city for several years.<ep>
   The bottom line is a school built for 661 children next year will have more students in classrooms outside the building than inside.<ep>
   When Dahl became principal five years ago, Royal Palm had 850 students. This year, there are 1,150. The school district estimates an enrollment of 1,379 this fall, but Dahl says the real number could be as high as 1,600.<ep>
   ``I'm hoping and praying it's the low end,'' she said.<ql>
<m4>--18.542 inches ( 111p8 )--from start of measuring to here--<m2><ql>
