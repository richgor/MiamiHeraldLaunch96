<m0>   Hershey bars and sausage pizza clinched the diagnosis for Jennifer Bush.<ep>
   Specialists at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center said the child did not need a feeding tube running to her stomach and another leading to a vein near her heart. The doctors say the child has no trouble digesting food on her own.<ep>
   On Monday, Broward Circuit Judge Arthur Birken authorized the doctors to remove the tubes as early as next week. Birken gave Jennifer's family time to challenge the doctors' findings.<ep>
   Jennifer, 8, arrived at the renowned hospital last Monday. By the weekend, she had downed slices of pizza, scrambled eggs and bacon, hot dogs, French toast and chocolate bars (--) all apparently without ill effect.<ep>
   The child's hearty appetite and normal digestion bolster both the Broward State Attorney's Office and the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services charges of child abuse against her mother.<ep>
   Investigators believe that Kathy Bush poisoned her daughter with prescription medicine, smeared feces on her feeding tubes and concocted medical histories to make her daughter ill.<ep>
   Experts have said Kathy Bush suffers from Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy, a rare form of child abuse in which an adult purposely makes a child ill to get attention.<ep>
   Jennifer ``seems to be eating everything they put in front of her,'' Assistant Attorney General Robert Julian said. ``If she does well out of custody of her mother, if all of a sudden she can tolerate food, the implication is that <m2><ql>

JENNIFER,  FROM  1A<ql>
<m0>something was wrong before she left the house.''<ep>
   For eight years, Jennifer has suffered from dozens of mysterious medical maladies resulting in more than 200 hospital stays and 40 surgeries.<ep>
   Doctors have removed her gall bladder, appendix and part of her intestine as well as surgically implanting three tubes (--) a stomach tube that has since been removed, a tube leading from her intestine through her abdominal wall, and the tube that runs beside her heart.<ep>
   Among the alleged diagnoses was neurogenic chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndrome, a rare condition that throws intestinal waves out of whack, causing chronic bouts of vomiting, diarrhea and food intolerance.<ep>
   Child abuse investigators now believe that Jennifer's mother induced the vomiting and diarrhea to dupe doctors.<ep>
<m0>Separated last month<ql>
<m0>   HRS social workers plucked Jennifer from her second-grade class April 15 and placed her in a foster home. She has been separated from her mother since then. Later that day, police arrested Kathy Bush for aggravated child abuse and defrauding medical providers of more than $50,000. She is out on bail and is expected to be formally charged next week.<ep>
   Doctors from the special gastrointestinal clinic for children at the Cincinnati hospital testified Monday that they found nothing wrong with Jennifer's digestive system. They measured her caloric intake. Doctors saw no sign of bloating, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation (--) all symptoms that Jennifer's mother had claimed her daughter had for years.<ep>
   ``She has demonstrated to us that she has tolerated a full diet,'' gastroenterologist Dr. Colin Rudolph said. ``I would be very, very surprised if she experienced problems that would require this type of intervention again.''<ep>
   The hospital's pediatric psychologist, Scott W. Powers, said Jennifer asks him repeatedly when the tubes will be removed.<ep>
   ``I told her I didn't know, but I asked her, `When would you like to have the tubes out?' She answered spontaneously, `Right now,' '' Powers said.<ep>
<m0>`Disfiguring nuisance'<ql>
<m0>   The doctors requested permission to remove the tubes, which they say put the child at risk for infections and are ``a disfiguring nuisance.''<ep>
   Charles Jamieson, an attorney for Jennifer's parents, Kathy and Craig Bush, asked the judge to delay removing the tubes until his experts could review 25,000 pages of Jennifer's past medical records and evaluate Jennifer's situation. He told the judge he could have three or more experts ``of equal caliber or better'' than Dr. Rudolph by Friday.<ep>
   ``I object to any indication that this doctor is neutral,'' Jamieson said.<ep>
   Julian, the attorney for HRS, said Kathy and Craig Bush are ``terrified'' of Jennifer's getting well.<ep>
   ``Instead of being happy that Jennifer is doing well in Cincinnati and could do without the tubes, they want to delay. They don't want to hear the child is doing well,'' Julian said. <ep>
   ``And the fact is, she should not be put at risk for one more day. There's no medical reason why this should be put off.''<ep>
   Judge Birken said the surgery should not be done before Monday to give the parents a chance to ask for an emergency hearing ``if the parents' doctor finds some great concern.''<ep>
   ``I would hope that everyone wants these tubes out of her,'' Birken said. ``I would hope that everyone wants her to recover and be normal.''<ql>
