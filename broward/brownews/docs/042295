<m0>   Praised for their professionalism and ability to take risks, Hollywood's top administrator and attorney easily passed the City Commission's annual review Wednesday and got $5,000 raises each.<ep>
   City Manager Sam Finz, 51, who is paid $108,000 a year, will make $113,000 starting June 20. That's a 4.62 percent increase.<ep>
   City Attorney Jamie Cole, 32, currently receives a base salary of $95,000 and will go to $100,000 retroactive to April 30. He got a 5.26 percent raise.<ep>
   Cole also gets $12,000 as legal counsel to the city's Community Redevelopment Agency. That compensation remains the same.<ep>
   The package for each also includes a life insurance upgrade that will cost the city about $1,000 each. The term life insurance policies that each already receives will be upgraded from $350,000 to $500,000.<ep>
   Commissioners unanimously approved the packages during a special meeting Wednesday.<ep>
   ``I think they do an outstanding job,'' Commissioner Ken Gottlieb said. ``They've done a lot for the city. I don't think we pay them enough. I think that what we've given them is very fair.''<ep>
   Mayor Mara Giulianti said she liked the fact that Finz, who has been city manager since 1993, took risks in tackling new programs.<ep>
   Among them: implementing a beach revitalization plan, preparing a five-year capital improvement plan for $86 million, reducing sanitation fees and city personnel costs and developing a tough anti-nepotism policy.<ep>
   ``We've had city managers who didn't risk anything because they were afraid to fail,'' Giulianti said. ``Not every single thing is going to succeed. We don't expect 20-20 vision that hindsight gives.''<ep>
   Commissioner Richard Blattner commended Finz for ``keeping as many balls in the air as he does and being able to catch all of them.'' <m1><ep>
<m0>   It wasn't all praise, though.<ep>
   Giulianti said she wanted Finz to interact and network more with other city managers around Broward <m1> <m0>to share ideas and collaborate on projects that could help the city.<ep>
   And Vice Mayor Cathy Anderson pointed out <m1> <m0>water billing problems that have generated calls this week from homeowners.<ep>
   ``I know that this occurred before you came, but you've got to straighten this stuff out,'' said Anderson.<ep>
   She also said she was concerned about the high salaries and raises being given to department heads and how they will affect the retirement system. And Anderson cited as a problem allowing some property owners to amass huge fines, which are then waived by the city.<ep>
   As for Cole, Commissioner Eleanor Sobel applauded the way he has explained legal issues and cases to the commission.<ep>
   ``Sometimes we have some very, very complicated cases. He has a way of reducing these to concise, clear meaning,'' she said.<ql>
