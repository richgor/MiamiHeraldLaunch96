<m0>   There were no immediate plans Monday to fill the Miramar ``sinkhole,'' as homeowners and developer Lennar reached a standoff on a plan to test for debris under homes.<ep>
   A third plan of action submitted by Lennar late Friday still did not call for testing under every house in Hampshire Homes (--) something homeowners are adamant about. They don't want the pit filled in until Lennar agrees to the testing.<ep>
   ``We will not approve it until it includes testing for all 308 homes,'' said Andre Melton, president of the Hampshire Homes Homeowners Association.<ep>
   The association sent its own plan to Lennar, calling for testing under each house in the development off Miramar Parkway and Palm Avenue if the homeowner wants it, but Lennar has not signed it. <ep>
   The Department of Natural Resource Protection also found Lennar's latest plan lacked one detail: a record of how and when the garbage was buried in the common area on the site.<ep>
   Miramar Police, meanwhile, have been investigating just how 250 truckloads of garbage were buried in the common back yard of 20 homes.<ep>
   ``We do have detectives investigating and questioning city employees,'' said Deputy Chief Chuck Febro. They have talked to Jaye Epstein, the city's community development director, about information related to the sinkhole.<ep>
   Richard Kittendorf, one of two building officials who signed off on Hampshire Homes in the late 1980s and early 1990s, told The Herald Monday he did not know trash had been buried on the site.<ep>
   He relied on reports from Biscayne Engineering, which was hired by Lennar to do soil testing, Kittendorf said.<ep>
   ``We depend on a statement from the developer's engineer stating what the soil conditions are,'' he said. ``It's upsetting to realize that all the documentation proved to be wrong.''<ep>
   Kittendorf, a building official and chief structural inspector, was one of two officials who signed building permits attesting to the structural soundness of the homes. The other official has died.<ep>
   Engineers for Biscayne Engineering have stated that they were only required to attest to the quality of the soil directly under the homes (--) not in the common area or front or back yards.<ep>
   Since the incident, the city has been looking into creating an ordinance requiring developers' engineers to do subsoil testing on the entire property, not just under homes, Kittendorf said.<ep>
   The city is waiting for information from the county Board of Rules and Appeals to determine how far the South Florida Building Code goes in requiring soil testing, he said.<ep>
