T<BR>
here's nothing buried in my new back yard. I watched the earth-moving machines pretty closely. My roof trusses are anchored securely. The roofing plywood is fastened to the trusses with nails, not staples. I looked.<P>

  I won't live in my new Pembroke Pines house for two more months. But the walls are up and the roof is on, and my wife and I visit it regularly -- and try to monitor the construction as carefully as we can.<P>

  We weren't always so careful. Our old house in South Dade looked secure and strong before Hurricane Andrew reduced it to rubble in August 1992. During its construction, it never occurred to us to check nail patterns or whether the hurricane straps were fastened on the gable end of the roof.<P>

  Then the storm exposed a heartbreaking heap of construction mistakes -- and taught thousands of homeowners like us a lesson: protect yourself.<BR>
Believe it or not, I learned how to protect myself from this very newspaper, in stories that told me how to inspect my home and protect my interests.<P>

  I've thought about that a lot since Herald reporter Julie Kay broke the story of the Miramar sinkhole last week. In case you missed it, a quick chronology: Back in February, holes began forming in the common grassy area behind 20 houses in a development called Hampshire Homes, near Miramar Parkway and Palm Avenue. State environmental experts poked around and ordered a cleanup by the builder, Lennar.<P>

  This sinkhole wasn't some natural depression that formed in the South Florida limestone. Work crews dug up more than 100 truckloads of garbage and tires. What was once a green play area for kids became a murky lake the size of a football field, surrounded by a chain-link fence. <P>

  Homeowners were shocked. Betrayed. Enraged. Most weren't around when the ground was prepared for their houses, and the huge pit of junk was covered with earth and turf. Many are second or third owners. Others bought after the homes were complete. <P>

  Thousands of other home buyers have had less dramatic surprises after signing on the dotted line. The discovery that a family room was built without a permit. A fence built across a property line.<P>

  I'm not sure how the Hampshire homeowners could have known what was under their back yards -- though some homeowners who moved out of the area say they noticed smaller sinkholes years ago. But you can surely know what's in your home -- whether it's built properly, and built legally.<BR>
At The Herald, we pride ourselves on publishing stories that help homeowners protect themselves. On June 13, The Herald will publish a special section on how to make sure you and your home are prepared for hurricane season.<P>

  On Dec. 28, reporter Sue Corbett outlined a step-by-step process home buyers should follow to make sure the home they are buying was built to code and with all the proper permits. Just a few of its suggestions:<P>

  <LI> Check with the building department to see the original plans for the home -- and any subsequent permits. If the home has a shed or an addition not reflected in the records, it could be a sign of trouble.<P>

  <LI> Visit the planning department and research what can be built on land near your home-to-be. If the field where cows graze today could be the used car lot of tomorrow, you want to know about it. <P>

  <LI> Ask the highway department to provide plans for improvements in your area. You may learn the easement behind your house is destined to be a road.
