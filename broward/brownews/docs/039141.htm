   The cruise ship that caught fire with more than 1,000 people on board passed a Coast Guard inspection just days before the engine compartment erupted in flames en route to the Bahamas.<P>

   ``I can tell you we had a Coast Guard inspection four days before and we passed,'' said Roberta Backus, a spokeswoman for Discovery Cruise Lines.<P>

   With its 600-plus passengers back home, cruise officials began the painstaking process Friday of trying to determine exactly how and where the fire started in the engine room of the Discovery I on Wednesday.<P>

   ``We flew in a team of fire specialists from Texas,'' Backus said.<P>

   While there were conflicting reports of how well the emergency was handled, the company maintained that the captain and crew handled the situation professionally.<P>

   ``I personally spoke to a great number of passengers who said the media reporting was unfair,'' said Backus.<P>

   News reports of the Discovery I being criticized in an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board were inaccurate, the board said Friday.<P>

   The vessel was built in 1971 and was operating as the Scandinavian Sea in 1984 when a fire erupted in a passenger compartment. The ship was considered totaled. No one was injured in the blaze and investigators never determined the cause.<P>

   The vessel was sold and was completely renovated in 1985 before becoming the Discovery I.<P>

   In a 1989 study of cruise ship incidents, the NTSB included an analysis of the Scandinavian Sea fire five years earlier. There were no incidents from the Discovery I to investigate.<P>

   ``It was a study of accident investigations that had been conducted prior to that time,'' said Marjorie Murtagh, chief of the marine division for NTSB. The Discovery I ``was not part of the 1989 study,'' she said.<P>

  The NTSB board study did find that major improvements were needed in the overall safety preparedness of passenger ships.<P>

   In 1993, the board issued another report, saying that the cruise industry should continue addressing problems in the areas of crew firefighting training, evacuation procedures and communication.<P>

   That report prompted a series of changes that included mandatory smoke detectors, sprinklers and fire alarms.<P>

   Earlier this year, the International Maritime Organization, a worldwide shipping advisory group that recommends safety standards, adopted a new standard for crew training and certification. Its implementation is pending, Murtagh said.<P>

   The Discovery fire was discovered about noon Wednesday while the ship was about three miles from Freeport. Capt. George Salichos was alerted to smoke in the engine room and ordered the engines shut down as a precaution. The ship was towed to Freeport Harbour.<P>

   All of the passengers returned Wednesday night and Thursday night. Some of the crew will remain with the ship in the Bahamas.<P>

   Inspectors from the U.S. Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office joined officials from Panama in Freeport, Bahamas, to investigate the fire. The ship was registered in Panama.<P>

   The NTSB has not been asked to investigate Wednesday's fire. The board would become involved only by the invitation of the ship's owner or the Panamanian government.<P>

   The Discovery Sun, which normally sails out of Miami, will pick up the slack and alternate between Port Everglades and the Port of Miami until further notice, Backus said.<P>

   ``It's business as usual,'' Backus said.
