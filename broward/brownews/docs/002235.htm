   Lennar agreed Tuesday to test for debris under all homes in Hampshire Homes, clearing the way for the developer to begin filling in the ``sinkhole'' as early as Monday, an attorney for the homeowners said.<P>

   Attorneys for Lennar and the Hampshire Homes Homeowners Association reached an agreement Tuesday that calls for Lennar to test under all 308 homes in the Miramar development, said Robert Kaye, an attorney for the homeowners association.<P>

   ``We're guardedly pleased,'' Kaye said. ``It is a big hurdle, but it's not over yet.''<P>

   Homeowners, who insisted on the testing before they would allow the pit to be filled in, are expected to finalize the agreement Thursday night, said Andre Melton, president of the Hampshire Home Homeowners Association.<P>

   He was pleased Lennar finally agreed to the testing. On Monday, the two sides appeared to have reached a standoff.<P>

   ``Yes, I'm happy,'' Melton said. ``Now we can get things going. [The sinkhole] is an eyesore, it smells, and with the media attention every day our property values keep dropping.''<P>

   Filling in the pit in the common back yard behind 20 homes in the development off Miramar Parkway and Palm Avenue would probably take several weeks, Kaye said.<P>

   Allan Pekor, Lennar's financial vice president, said Tuesday an agreement had been reached, but hesitated to comment on the terms of the agreement or even confirm that Lennar would test under all 308 homes.<P>

   ``An agreement is not an agreement until it is signed on the dotted line,'' he said. ``Until we get all parties to sign off on it Thursday, I don't want to comment. But we are very hopeful.''<P>

   The agreement calls for Lennar to first do ground-penetrating radar testing.<P>

   William Holderby, who owns one of the homes around the pit, said his home was tested Tuesday with ground-penetrating radar. The tests involve dragging a sledlike machine across the floor in homes and across the yards to detect whether debris is buried deep below ground.<P>

   The tests cost about $1,000 per home, according to Omega Engineering of Coral Springs, which was hired by the homeowners association.<P>

   If debris is found beneath the home, then boring tests would be done -- either at an angle or directly through the floor. According to estimates from Omega, those tests can cost $1,500 to $2,000 each.<P>

   The question of what would happen if debris were found under the homes has not been resolved. But homeowners expect Lennar ``to correct it so that the conditions are clean,'' Kaye said.<P>

   Before filling in the pit, Lennar will build a dam in the center of the brown, murky lake and place equipment there. The company will do more digging to determine whether any more debris is buried in the pit. The lake will then be drained, filled in with dirt and sand and resodded.<P>

   ``I think it's wonderful that Lennar has become responsible,'' Miramar City Commissioner Sandy Lucas said Tuesday. ``This will give homeowners some assurance and remove the stigma of a cloud hanging over their homes.''
