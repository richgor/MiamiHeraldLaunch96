   The Florida Attorney General's Office on Tuesday launched an investigation into the apparently accidental shooting of a Davie man by a Hallandale police officer.<P>

   ``The circumstances appear suspicious,'' said Gregory Durden, director of civil rights for the Attorney General's Office. ``This is a little unusual because he was not armed. He was complying with what she wanted. There was no reason for him to get shot.''<P>

   Hallandale police maintain the man was armed with a knife -- though they won't say where the knife was found after the shooting.<P>

   ``We've had about 500 different stories as to what was going on,'' said Capt. James Kirchoff. ``It's still under investigation.''<P>

   This much is clear:<P>

   Donnell Mitchell, 37, was shot in the buttocks as he lay face down on the ground Monday evening.<P>

   He had been ordered there by officer Marsha Roaden -- who had been summoned by a city worker to investigate some kind of fight.<P>

   Roaden was using one hand to handcuff Mitchell as she clutched her gun in the other.<P>

   ``Just think about it. How are you going to handcuff somebody if you have one hand with a gun in it?'' Durden said.<P>

   Witnesses said the problem started when Mitchell was attacked by a group of people while riding a bicycle along Northwest Sixth Avenue. On Tuesday, residents of the quiet Northwest Hallandale neighborhood said Mitchell had stolen the bike. The fight was a result of some residents trying to reclaim it. Police couldn't verify the story.<P>

   Mitchell's criminal record includes convictions for arson and criminal mischief. He was sentenced in 1989 to 3 1/2 years in state prison but was released after seven months. He is on probation until May 2001.<P>

   He was not arrested Monday. Mitchell refused to comment Tuesday on the advice of his lawyer.<P>

   While onlookers reacted with outrage to the shooting Monday evening, on Tuesday neighborhood leaders called for calm -- but demanded an investigation.<P>

   ``We realized that basically that was a mistake [Monday],'' said John Hardwick, president of the Northwest Hallandale Civic Association. ``We need to investigate and be more understanding that mistakes do happen. By the same token, we don't tolerate anyone being mistreated.''<P>

   Roaden, a 13-year veteran, has been suspended with pay from her approximately $45,000-a-year job while the shooting is reviewed. She is prohibited from publicly discussing the shooting.<P>

   Roaden's weapon -- a .40-caliber Glock -- comes from a family of weapons with a reputation for unintentional firings.<P>

   While Metro-Dade prohibits the use of Glocks, the light-weight weapon is popular in many departments, including the Miami Police Department, said Armando Valdes, senior firearms instructor for Miami police.<P>

   Glocks used by Miami require eight pounds of pressure to pull the trigger. Five is standard. <P>

   ``We felt five pounds was a little too light,'' Valdes said.<P>

   A Glock adjusted for competition shooting needs only 3.5 pounds to fire, he said.<P>

   Even with the less sensitive weapons, Miami officers are trained to keep their fingers off the triggers unless they intend to shoot.<P>

   Tests showed that reaction times varied less than a second for finger on-the-trigger and finger off-the-trigger practice shooting, Valdes said.<P>

   Another reason for off-trigger training is something called ``sympathetic contractions.'' It happens, Valdes said, when you're startled, when you loose your balance or when you exert yourself.<P>

   ``We did this experiment where we had an officer hold an egg in one hand, then hold heavy books in the other hand,'' he said.<P>

   As the weight of the books increased, the hand holding the egg tightened -- eventually cracking the egg.<P>

   ``What one hand does, the other hand imitates,'' he said. ``That's why we modified our training.''<P>

   Commander George Long, a weapons expert at Broward's Criminal Justice Institute, said the .40-caliber Glock is a popular weapon and no more dangerous than any other semi-automatic.<P>

   Recruits at the academy are taught to hold unholstered weapons in two positions: firing position at a target, firing position at the ground.<P>

   ``It's in order to teach control of the weapon,'' he said. ``You have to know how hard it is to pull the trigger.''<P>

   But, Long said, recruits are also taught to put the gun in their holster before trying to handcuff a suspect.
