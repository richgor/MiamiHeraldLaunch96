   Joanne Medalie, long a civic activist in Fort Lauderdale, has been known to take hard stands about issues affecting her Fort Lauderdale beach neighborhood.<P>

   This weekend, as hundreds of thousands of people converge on her neighborhood near Ground Zero for the Shell Air & Sea Show, Medalie will be standing firm once again -- on the beach, at the end of her street, watching in wonderment as some of the world's most sophisticated military aircraft and fanciest boats transform Fort Lauderdale's shoreline into an exciting two-day beach party.<P>

   ``It's going to be crazy, but everybody deserves some craziness occasionally,'' says Medalie, who lives with her husband, Don, on Northeast 17th Street off State Road A1A. ``This is our neighborhood's turn to take a hit. Why complain?''<P>

   This year's attraction: nearly two-dozen military aircraft, from the U.S. Air Force Blackhawk helicopters to the world-famous U.S. Navy Blue Angels; eight civilian aircraft demonstration teams; hang gliders; stunt planes; offshore powerboat racers; water skiers; Hovercraft; ocean-rescue demonstrations.<P>

   ``This show is dramatically larger than last year's,'' says promoter Mickey Markoff, who enjoys talking in such superlatives. ``And the aircraft are extremely sophisticated technologically. It's going to be great.''<P>

   Only weeks ago, the center of the air show was moved a mile north to A1A and Sunrise Boulevard so the aircraft would not affect Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.<P>

   With the move, the Medalies and their neighbors got special city passes to get them in and out of their street. Not everyone is happy, city officials say. But many have simply resigned themselves to the inconvenience. Or simply made plans to get out of town.<P>

   For merchants like Tim Schiavone, owner of the Parrot Lounge, the show is a profitable weekend in the short run, a great boost to Fort Lauderdale beach in the future.<P>

   ``This will bring Fort Lauderdale to the level of a real destination town,'' he says. ``This will finally give us an identity that will take the place of spring break.''<P>

   At the other end of the beach, John Amodeo, owner of both the Oasis Cafe and the Sloop John B, is disappointed his taverns aren't at show center anymore. But he's cautiously optimistic.<P>

   ``Last year, it was a terrific event,'' he said. ``It was a good-looking crowd, no problems, traffic moved very evenly. Things couldn't have been better.''<P>

   Fort Lauderdale police spokesman Clinton Ward reiterated the city's plea: take the shuttle buses, the Water Taxi, walk, bicycle -- do anything  but drive  to the beach.<P>

   ``We want to make sure everyone is inconvenienced as little as possible,'' he said.<BR>
In and on the air<BR>
<P>

  The idea of broadcasting an air and sea show on the radio seems ludicrous. But for the hundreds of thousands of spectators at the event, it's the only way to know what's going on.<P>

   WINZ 940 AM and its sister Latin station, WACC 830 AM, will broadcast the show from noon to 4 p.m. both Saturday and Sunday. U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Mario Garza will join WACC's Joe Cardona for the Spanish broadcast on WACC; retired U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Cappy Vartan and WINZ newsman Michael Woulfe will call the show again over WINZ.<P>

   ``We're telling people to take your Walkman, take your boombox and look up. We'll tell you what's going on,'' Woulfe says.<BR>
On the water<P>

   Thousands of boats were stretched for miles along the Fort Lauderdale shoreline to watch last year's shows. U.S. Coast Guard and local police marine units kept boaters outside a line of buoys beneath the flight paths of the performance aircraft. Amazingly, there was not one boating accident, says Fort Lauderdale police marine unit Sgt. Tom Ogden.<P>

   ``The public at large was excellent obeying the lines and the law,'' Ogden says.<P>

   Ogden wants to keep it that way. ``We're not going to allow any intoxicated boaters,'' he said. ``We're going to keep people behind buoys and monitor the action on boats, and if it looks like things are out of hand, we're going to take action.''<BR>
Alternatives<P>

   So you don't want to fight the crowds and still want to see the military aircraft?<P>

   Scores of people hung out around the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport last year watching the planes take off and land. Spectators are no longer allowed to park at the west end of the main runway. The new viewing area is near the animal control building between the western ends of the two east-west runways.<BR>
The weather<P>

   Dave Damian, WTVJ-Channel 6's weatherman, says the weekend should be windy but clear.<P>

   ``It looks like we're going to be OK,'' he said. ``Temperature in the mid-80s, windy on Saturday, a little less on Sunday, much like the pattern we're seeing now. Unless something unforeseen happens, it should be another nice weekend like we had last year.''<P>

   Unless you're on  a boat, of course.<P>

   Officially, seas have been listed as four to six feet all week, he said. But show crews trying to put out buoys couldn't work Wednesday because swells were as high as 10 feet.<P>

   ``I guess Dramamine will be at a premium,'' Damian said.
