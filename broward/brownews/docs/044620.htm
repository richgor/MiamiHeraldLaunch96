   Would you want a 75-foot cellular tower with a cross on top behind your house?<P>

   That's what William Grefe plans to ask members of the Pembroke Pines Planning and Zoning Board on Thursday when they review a request by AT&T to put up a tower behind his house in Sunshine Ranches.<P>

   The neighboring church wants to top off the structure with a cross.<P>

   Grefe and his neighbors say the tower doesn't fit in the neighborhood in unincorporated Broward where homes sit on more than an acre and people take their horses for a ride around the block.<P>

   ``Any commissioner, any mayor, any zoning board member would have the same objections,'' said Grefe, who lives on Mustang Trail.<P>

   AT&T wants to put the tower next to Abundant Living Ministries, 14331 Sheridan St., on the only patch of land north of Sheridan Street between Flamingo Road and Interstate 75 that's in Pembroke Pines.<P>

   Sunshine Ranches homeowners in the 400-home community are gathering signatures to oppose the tower and are calling Pembroke Pines City Hall to protest. Residents fear the tower will destroy the country-like lifestyle they have fought to maintain despite development encroaching on their neighborhood between Sheridan Street and Griffin Road and Flamingo and Volunteer roads.<P>

   ``It's a real ranch area. It just doesn't fit in,'' said Ruth Wolff, a member of the Sunshine Ranches Homeowners Association. ``We've preserved the area this way for over 25 years. It's the solitude. It's open space.''<P>

   Another problem is the height, homeowners say. A nearby homeowner often lands his helicopter in his yard and Sunshine Ranches residents wonder if the tower will get in his way.<P>

   But Pembroke Pines city planners say the tower fits in and have recommended approving it. Cellular towers are allowed anywhere in the city, limited only in height.<P>

   Grefe wonders why AT&T selected the church site and overlooked Pembroke Falls, a 3,700-unit residential and commercial development south of Sheridan.<P>

   ``Why don't they take one of those lots and put the tower there?'' he said.<P>

   AT&T representatives could not be reached for comment Monday.<P>

   Homeowners in Sunshine Ranches have objected to projects in Pembroke Pines before. They have fought construction of homes and shopping centers nearby and staved off attempts to annex the neighborhood.<P>

   When Century Village first proposed building in Pembroke Pines, Sunshine Ranches persuaded the developer to build south of Pines Boulevard instead of on Sheridan Street, Wolff said.<P>

   Last year, Pembroke Falls cut down a row of melaleuca trees shielding the ranches from Sheridan. After homeowners complained, the developer built a berm and marsh to buffer the homes from traffic.<P>

   ``We can't fight everything and expect to win everything,'' said Brian Reynolds, president of the Sunshine Ranches Homeowners Association. ``It's not that we want to be left alone or segregated, but this is the last vestige of wide open space in Broward.''
