<ue5><m0>Letter carriers to collect, deliver food<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   South Florida letter carriers hope to deliver more than a million pounds of nonperishable food to needy families in coming months. They're asking residents and businesses to leave donations for carriers to pick up Saturday, wherever mail normally is delivered.<ep>
   Bags and cartons of food may be left beside residential mailboxes or near common mailbox areas in condominiums and apartments.<ep>
   ``We're looking for things people can make a meal out of,'' said Ezra M. Krieg, associate director of Daily Bread Food Bank in South Florida, which will distribute the goods. Suggested items are canned soups and vegetables, pasta, beans and rice. The donation of glass jars is discouraged.<ep>
   The effort is part of a national drive that last year collected more than 40 million pounds of food. In South Florida, more than 800,000 pounds were collected and distributed to more than 1,200 South Florida groups that feed the needy. <m1><ql>

   On Thursday, Motorola will have a celebration for youth motivators and the students they mentor. And on Friday, Partners in Education, Broward's business-education partnership, will have its annual Partnership of the Year Recognition Breakfast. <m1><ql>

<m0>PORT EVERGLADES<ql>
<m1><ue5><m0>Port to be site of destroyer commissioning<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   Port Everglades has been selected as the commissioning site for the U.S. Navy's latest guided missile destroyer, which will be formally commissioned as the USS Cole on June 8.<ep>
   Constructed by Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., the Arleigh Burke Class warship is expected to arrive at Port Everglades on June 3 and depart on June 10.<ep>
   Lee Perry, wife of U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, is the ship's sponsor, and Secretary Perry is scheduled to be the principle speaker at the commissioning ceremony.<ep>
   The ship is named for Marine Sgt. Darrell Samuel Cole, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism during the invasion of Iwo Jima in 1945.<ep>
   While the commissioning ceremony will be open to invited guests only, the new ship will be open to the public from 2 to 5 p.m. June 9. <m1><ql>

<m0>WESTON<ql>
<m1><ue5><m0>Cocomo's may re-open as community center<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   Cocomo's, the Weston restaurant and bar best known for its closing, is once again about to go out of business. But this time, no one's protesting.<ep>
   Cocomo's is an informal gathering place for some members of the Weston Athletic Club, which is in the same building at 2300 Arvida Pkwy. Last July, a small but vocal group convinced Arvida/JMB Partners to change its plans to close the watering hole. The protesters talked the developer into keeping the bar portion open. Since then, residents have been talking with Arvida about Cocomo's future.<ep>
   Now, they have a plan: Close the bar May 31, then re-open all of Cocomo's as a community center. It would become a meeting place for all ages and all kinds of local groups, said Arvida's Claudia Troisi, who is in charge of commercial development in Weston.<ep>
   Troisi said she hoped to hammer out the specifics in the next two weeks. In the meantime, she is looking for experienced food and beverage operators who want to bid on rights to serve food at the community center, using what was Cocomo's kitchen. Anyone interested can join Troisi on a tour of the facilities Monday. For a time and more details, call Troisi at 384-8000. <m1><ql>
