<m0>  A group of lawyers and lawmakers met with homeowners who live near the Hampshire Homes sinkhole Saturday and vowed to help owners fight against Lennar Homes.<ep>
   ``We need a big dog on our side,'' said homeowner William Holderby. ``We need someone to fight with us and start treating Lennar on an equal level.''<ep>
   Miramar City Commissioner Dan Lewis, state Sen. Ken Jenne, D-Fort Lauderdale, and several attorneys met with the residents.<ep>
   Lawyers from Jenne's firm of Conrad Scherer & Jenne have offered to represent homeowners in filing suit against Lennar, Holderby said.<ep>
   On Friday, Lennar officials said they would not purchase the 20 homes backing onto the sinkhole, as residents had demanded.<ql>
