  Debbie Wasserman Schultz: Your name is mud in parts of Pembroke Pines.<P>

   And now would not be the time to ask the School Board for a favor.<P>

   Wasserman Schultz, a state representative whose district includes a wide swath of West Broward, was the architect of a plan to use $270,000 of lottery funds -- earmarked to reduce classroom size -- to build a kindergarten/teen center in Weston.<P>

   By day, 5-year-olds from Country Isles Elementary would learn their ABCs there, averting the imposition of half-day kindergarten.<P>

   Come midafternoon, middle school students from the K2 Project would make the place their own.<P>

   But parents in western Pembroke Pines, whom Wasserman Schultz also represents, want to know why there was no plan for their kids.<P>

   ``It's really nice what she did for Weston, now what is she going to do for us?'' asked Susan Meister, chairwoman of Chapel Trail Elementary's school advisory council. ``Our overcrowding is worse.''<P>

   Wasserman Schultz says she pushed the Weston plan because Arvida, the Weston developer, was willing to kick in $465,000 for construction.<P>

   ``Had this idea originated in Pembroke Pines, I would have gone to bat for them, too,'' she said Friday. ``I support any effort to reduce overcrowding.''<P>

  But Wasserman Schultz also has angered School Board members, who feel she circumvented their authority and question how a facility could be built to house little kids and preteens.<P>

  ``I have lots of questions and no answers,'' said School Board chairwoman Lois Wexler. ``But the biggest one is, `Am I ever going to get to vote yes or no on this?' ''<BR>
 <BR>
<P>

  Maybe not. The $270,000 appropriation, passed by the Legislature early Saturday, must be matched with $250,000 in private funds by Sept. 1.<BR>
<P>

   No problem, says Dee Scott Valdez, the force behind the proposed teen center, called the K2 Project. There's no money yet, but Valdez plans to raffle off a robot her students are building.<P>

  The first thing you need to know about K2 is that it has nothing to do with elementary school.<P>

   ``When Debbie called me about K2, I thought she was talking about kindergarten through second grade,'' said Diana Wasserman, the School Board member whose district covers Weston and Pembroke Pines.<P>

   In fact, the project refers to K2, the world's second-tallest mountain -- because the centerpiece of the center is to be a rock-climbing wall.<P>

   But it could also refer to Valdez's uphill struggle to get the center built.<P>

   The mother of two adolescents herself, Valdez began seeking support for an after-school program for Weston youngsters three years ago. She went to Arvida's Roy Rogers, who agreed to donate a band shell behind the Weston Athletic Club.<P>

   A prominent architect drew plans to enclose and expand the band shell into a 7,500-square-foot building. His design included a computer lab, study hall, game room, offices, soda fountain, in-line skating rink, DJ booth and the climbing wall.<P>

   After school, mostly volunteers would use the building to offer homework mentoring, art classes, a ``mad scientists'' club, a baby-sitting referral service, gardening and, of course, rock-climbing.<P>

   She wrote an exhaustive business plan for the project, estimating it would cost $694,000 to build the facility.<P>

   She projected a need for a staff of four, including a program director and a director of the nonprofit K2 Corp., who would earn $35,000 and $30,000 a year respectively. The second-year operating budget calls for the addition of a public relations director at a salary of $30,000 a year.<P>

   To sustain the projected annual operating budget of $182,000, Valdez estimated she would need 600 members to pay between $200 and $400 in dues a year.<P>

   Valdez says K2 has 30 to 50 members. Growth is stymied by the lack of a place to meet.<P>

   ``We have a robotics class that has been meeting out of my garage for the last three months,'' Valdez said.<P>

   Though no plans have been drawn, Valdez thinks the center could be reworked to accommodate kindergartners. She envisions round tables that could be rolled to storage in the afternoon, pull-down desks for teachers, blackboards on wheels.<P>

   ``Ambitious,'' Superintendent Frank Petruzielo calls the plan.<P>

   Unworkable, say Country Isles parents.<P>

   ``Aren't these children going to have desks and chairs?'' asked Shelley Eichner, a Country Isles parent. ``Is somebody going to move those out each day and then move them back?''<P>

   Administrators also questioned Valdez's cost estimates. Petruzielo said furnishings alone could run $400,000.<P>

   Valdez still thinks there's room to negotiate.<P>

   ``I care about Weston, so I said, `We'll try to accommodate this,' '' Valdez said. ``We aren't the bad guys. But we might be better off just waiting a year and raising our own money.''
