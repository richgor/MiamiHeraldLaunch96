<m0>   A 74-year-old man was on life support late Friday after shooting himself in the head in an apparent suicide attempt at a Pembroke Park gun range, investigators said.<ep>
   The man, Melvin Kahn of Hallandale, may have tried to commit suicide, said Jim Leljedal, spokesman for the Broward Sheriff's Office.<ep>
   Kahn arrived at the American Indoor Gun Range at 3130 SW 19th St. at about 6:55 p.m. A woman was driving the car that dropped him off. Witnesses heard him say he'd call her when he was done, detectives said.<ep>
   Kahn registered with the range master, then took up a position on the firing line with the .38-caliber revolver.<ep>
   ``He was not a regular,'' Leljedal said. ``I think it was his first time. . . . According to the employee, there was nothing unusual. He acted normal.''<ep>
   Three other customers and a range employee were on the line at the time, Leljedal said.<ep>
   Witnesses said Kahn fired several shots at the target. A short time later, someone saw him on the floor and noticed his head was bleeding, Leljedal said.<ep>
   Pembroke Park fire-rescue workers responded, treated Kahn and transported him to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, where he was listed in extremely critical condition at about 10:30 p.m. Friday, Leljedal said.<ep>
  They determined the shooting was an attempted suicide, Leljedal said.<ql>
