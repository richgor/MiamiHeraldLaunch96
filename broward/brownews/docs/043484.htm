   Chocolate bars and sausage pizza clinched the diagnosis for Jennifer Bush: She's a normal 8-year-old with a healthy appetite.<P>

   The Coral Springs child, who has spent much of her life in hospitals having liquid meals pumped directly into her intestines, does not need the feeding tubes that protrude from her stomach and chest, specialists at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center said Monday. Jennifer has no trouble digesting food on her own, doctors say.<P>

   They asked a Broward judge for permission to remove a feeding tube running to her intestine and another leading to a vein near her heart.<P>

   Broward Circuit Judge Arthur Birken authorized the removal as early as next week. The judge gave Jennifer's family time to challenge the doctors' findings. Her mother faces child abuse charges in the case.<P>

   Jennifer arrived at the renowned hospital last Monday. By the weekend, she had downed slices of pizza, scrambled eggs and bacon, hot dogs, French toast and chocolate candy -- all apparently without ill effect.<P>

   ``She loves Hershey bars, apparently,'' said gastroenterologist Colin Rudolph, who testified by telephone at a 4 p.m. hearing Monday in Judge Birken's court, along with pediatric psychologist Scott W. Powers.<P>

   The child's hearty appetite and normal digestion bolster both the Broward State Attorney's Office and the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services charges against her mother.<P>

   Authorities have charged Kathy Bush with aggravated child abuse and defrauding medical providers of more than $50,000. They believe she poisoned her daughter with prescription medicine, smeared feces on her feeding tubes and concocted medical histories to make Jennifer ill.<P>

   Experts have said Kathy Bush suffers from Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy, a form of child abuse in which an adult purposely makes a child ill to get attention.<P>

   For eight years, Jennifer exhibited conflicting symptoms that confounded doctors and led to more than 200 hospital stays and 40 surgeries.<P>

   Since she has been at Cincinnati, Jennifer ``seems to be eating everything they put in front of her,'' Assistant Attorney General Robert Julian said. ``If she does well out of custody of her mother, if all of a sudden she can tolerate food, the implication is that something was wrong before she left the house.''<P>

Three-week stay<BR>
   Social workers separated Jennifer from her mother April 15. She had been living in a foster home until she went to Cincinnati last week and is expected to remain there for at least two more weeks.<P>

   Rudolph said he found nothing wrong with Jennifer's digestive system. The tubes, he said, put the child at risk unnecessarily for infections and are ``a disfiguring nuisance.''<P>

   Specialists stopped her liquid feeding the first day. For the past seven days, they have measured her caloric intake. She averaged 1,460 calories -- essentially normal for a child her size. Doctors saw no sign of bloating, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation -- all symptoms Jennifer's mother had claimed her daughter had for years.<P>

   Child abuse investigators now believe that Jennifer's mother induced the vomiting and diarrhea by overdosing her on anti-seizure medicine to dupe doctors.<P>

No dietary problems<BR>
   Jennifer ``has demonstrated to us that she has tolerated a full diet,'' Rudolph said. ``I would be very, very surprised if she experienced problems that would require this type of intervention again.''<P>

   Powers said Jennifer asks him repeatedly when the tubes will be removed.<P>

   ``I told her I didn't know, but I asked her, `When would you like to have the tubes out?' She answered spontaneously, `Right now,' '' Powers said.<P>

   Kathy Bush often told doctors that a Boston specialist, Dr. Alex Flores, diagnosed Jennifer with neurogenic chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndrome, a rare condition that throws intestinal waves out of whack, causing chronic bouts of vomiting, diarrhea and food intolerance.<P>

   Based partly on Kathy Bush's recitation of her daughter's symptoms and Flores' alleged diagnosis, doctors have removed part of her intestine as well as surgically implanting three tubes -- a stomach tube that has since been removed, a tube leading from her intestine through her abdominal wall, and the tube that runs beside her heart.<P>

   Flores, contacted by investigators earlier this year, said he never diagnosed the rare disorder. And doctors at the Cincinnati hospital confirm that Jennifer shows no signs of digestive difficulty.<P>

Request for delay<BR>
   Charles Jamieson, an attorney for Jennifer's parents, Kathy and Craig Bush, asked the judge to delay removing the tubes until his experts could review 25,000 pages of Jennifer's past medical records and evaluate Jennifer's situation. He told the judge he could have three or more experts ``of equal caliber or better'' than Dr. Rudolph by Friday.<P>

   ``I object to any indication that this doctor is neutral,'' Jamieson said.<P>

   Julian, the attorney for HRS, said Kathy and Craig Bush are ``terrified'' of Jennifer's getting well.<P>

   ``Instead of being happy that Jennifer is doing well in Cincinnati and could do without the tubes, they want to delay. They don't want to hear the child is doing well,'' Julian said. <P>

   ``And the fact is, she should not be put at risk for one more day. There's no medical reason why this should be put off.''<P>

   Judge Birken said the surgery should not be done before Monday to give the parents a chance to ask for an emergency hearing ``if the parents' doctor finds some great concern.''<P>

   ``I would hope that everyone wants these tubes out of her,'' Birken said. ``I would hope that everyone wants her to recover and be normal.''
