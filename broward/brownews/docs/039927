<m0>   Hollywood's city manager and city attorney will get report cards today on their performance (--) and possibly raises.<ep>
   Commissioners will decide how well City Manager Sam Finz and City Attorney Jamie Cole have worked for the city in 1995-96.<ep>
   All five commissioners appear ready to fatten their paychecks.<ep>
   Finz and Cole deserve pay increases, Mayor Mara Giulianti said Tuesday. ``I believe the raises probably won't average over 5 percent,'' she said.<ep>
   Commissioners Kenneth Gottlieb and Eleanor Sobel also praised the pair.<ep>
   ``I think they are both doing outstanding jobs,'' Sobel said. ``Sam is leading contender for the title of chief workaholic in the city. And Mr. Cole, I think he is absolutely brilliant. He knows the law and he explains it clearly and concisely.''<ep>
   Will Finz and Cole ask for more money?<ep>
   Finz: ``I think that the people I work for know my value and they make that determination for me.''<ep>
   Cole: ``It's up to the commission. They can do whatever they want.''<ep>
   But just to make sure city leaders don't rack their brains trying to remember points of praise, Cole and Finz prepared reports listing their accomplishments.<ep>
   Finz, who earns $108,000 a year, has been city manager since 1993. He wrote a 13-page report touting some of his high points for the year:<ep>
   (box) Preparing a five-year capital improvement plan for $86 million.<ep>
   (box) Reducing sanitation fees and city personnel costs.<ep>
   (box) Implementing a beach revitalization plan.<ep>
 (box) Developing a tougher anti-nepotism policy to target allegations of favoritism in police department hiring practices.<ep>
   Cole's report was even thicker (--) 120 pages. Since June 1995, the city attorney's office has concluded 31 cases. In 17 of them, the city did not have to pay anything, either because it won or the case was dismissed, according to the report. Only one case resulted in a payment of more than $50,000.<ep>
   Cole earns $95,000 a year as city attorney, plus $12,000 for his work as legal counsel to the city's Community Redevelopment Agency.<m1><ep>
<m0>   Commissioner Richard Blattner also praised Finz and Cole.<ep>
   ``I think [Cole has] saved the city a lot of money on outside services by bringing a lot of things in-house,'' Blattner said.<ep>
   And Finz has been prolific. ``The city manager has proposed literally unlimited numbers of programs to improve the city,'' Blattner said.<ep>
   The two also are working better together (--) something commissioners last year urged the two city officials to do.<ep>
   ``I think there was some turf building and standoffishness that you don't see anymore,'' Blattner said.<ep>
   Both men have done a good job and deserve raises, said Vice Mayor Cathy Anderson. But she added that Finz still has problems to fix.<ep>
   ``I tell him every single week he's hiring too many people,'' Anderson said. ``And he's giving department heads too-generous raises and letting department heads give their assistants too-generous raises.''<ql>
