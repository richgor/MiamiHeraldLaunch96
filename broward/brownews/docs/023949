<m1><ue5><m0>Cops: Intruder stabbed by teenage girl<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   A 17-year-old boy who broke into a Lauderhill house was stabbed in the shoulder Wednesday by the teenage girl who lived at house, police said. <ep>
   Hours later, the teen intruder was arrested when one of the teen girls recognized him as a former classmate, said Lauderhill police spokeswoman Lucy Crockett.<ep>
   This is what police say happened:<ep>
   The 15-year-old girl and a friend were hanging laundry outside the house about 1:45 p.m. Wednesday when two teen boys sneaked inside the house, police said.<ep>
   When the two girls walked inside, they realized that the house, at 4810 NW 20th St., had been burglarized. The girls got a knife from the kitchen and checked the house to make sure no one was inside.<ep>
   When the girls started straightening out one of the rooms, they heard someone walk in through the front door, Crockett said. The girls hid in the bedroom. When one of the youths walked inside the room, the 15-year old stabbed him, Crockett said. The boys ran away and the girls called police.<ep>
   Officers found the injured youth at Broward General Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale and charged him with burglary. Police had not found the second youth late Thursday. Several pieces of jewelry were missing.<ep>
   Anyone with information about the case is asked to call Lauderhill police at 497-4700 or Crimestoppers at 493-8477.<m1><ql>

<m1><ue5><m0>BSO sponsoring bicycle rodeo for kids<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   The Broward Sheriff's Office is sponsoring a bicycle rodeo, registration and free helmet giveaway, just in time for a new Florida law that requires kids under 16 to wear a helmet while riding in the street.<ep>
   Children from first through fifth grades can participate in the event, which will begin at 9 a.m. Tuesday at Watkins Elementary School, 3601 SW 56th Ave., Pembroke Park. <ep>
   The first 40 kids to get their bikes engraved with a special identification number will receive a bicycle helmet. The ID number will help police identify the bike if it's ever stolen. The rodeo will stress biking safety.<ep>
   The bicycle helmet law, which was passed by the Florida Legislature and goes into effect in 1997, is expected to reduce biking head injuries by 85 percent.<m1><ql>
