<m0> The Broward School Board on Tuesday approved more than 100 school waiver requests, including one that may reduce the school week for students at Pompano Beach's Ely High School.<ep>
  According to the school calendar waiver requested by a school committee, Ely students would attend classes four days a week instead of five. The fifth day would be optional for field trips and special programs.<ep>
   Ely is a medical/science and pre-engineering magnet school.<ep>
  Under the recommendation approved by Superintendent Frank Petruzielo and voted on by board members, the school will have up to a year to map out a plan for altering the school week.<ep>
  Among some of the waiver requests recommended by the superintendent and approved by the board: exam exemptions, the use of alternate referral forms, and the integration of health into the sixth-grade physical education curriculum.<ep>
  All waivers pertaining to the grading scale were deferred for more discussion later this month at a School Board retreat.<ql>
