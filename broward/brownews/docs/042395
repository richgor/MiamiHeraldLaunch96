<m0>   Today, Indian Trace supervisors also will talk about big blasts that have rocked Weston.<ep>
   In reaction to the recent series in The Herald, the board asked staff and its consultant GeoSonics to report on 33 blasts noted in the articles that exceeded county blasting limits during the past five years.<ep>
   ``I'm very sensitive to anything to do with blasting,'' said Indian Trace Chairman Harry Rosen. ``If anybody is exceeding the limits in Weston, I want to know about it and not read it in the paper.''<ep>
   Indian Trace has its own set of blasting regulations and complaint procedures. Supervisor Eric Hersh said he'll be trying to determine whether those procedures have been followed and whether residents have been properly informed about ways to resolve blasting disputes. The 7:30 p.m. meeting is at the Weston Hills Country Club, 2600 Country Club Way, Weston.<ql>
