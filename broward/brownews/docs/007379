<m0>  A 20-year-old man was fatally shot in the driveway of a duplex apartment Monday night near Fort Lauderdale.<ep>
   Shelton Jackson was standing outside the duplex at 2709 NW 15th St. about 8 p.m. when two men in a white car drove up, said Broward Sheriff's Office spokesman Jim Leljedal.<ep>
   Witnesses told police the men got out of the car and approached Jackson. One of the men pulled out a gun and fired it at close range, hitting Jackson.<ep>
   Jackson collapsed and was pronounced dead when paramedics arrived, Leljedal said.<ep>
   After the shooting, the suspects hopped into their car and drove east on 15th Street and then north on Northwest 27th Avenue.<ep>
   Detectives aren't sure what the motive for the killing was, but said it appeared the victim and the suspect knew each other and were involved in a dispute, Leljedal said.<ep>
   Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call BSO homicide detectives Jim Carr or Eli Thomasevich at 321-4210 or Crime Stoppers at 493-TIPS.<ql>
