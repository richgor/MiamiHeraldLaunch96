<m0>   The Florida Attorney General's Office on Tuesday launched an investigation into the apparently accidental shooting of a Davie man by a Hallandale police officer.<ep>
   ``The circumstances appear suspicious,'' said Gregory Durden, director of civil rights for the Attorney General's Office. ``This is a little unusual because he was not armed. He was complying with what she wanted. There was no reason for him to get shot.''<ep>
   Hallandale police maintain the man was armed with a knife (--) though they won't say where the knife was found after the shooting.<ep>
   ``We've had about 500 different stories as to what was going on,'' said Capt. James Kirchoff. ``It's still under investigation.''<ep>
   This much is clear:<ep>
   Donnell Mitchell, 37, was shot in the buttocks as he lay face down on the ground Monday evening.<ep>
   He had been ordered there by officer Marsha Roaden (--) who had been summoned by a city worker to investigate some kind of fight.<ep>
   Roaden was using one hand to handcuff Mitchell as she clutched her gun in the other.<ep>
   ``Just think about it. How are you going to handcuff somebody if you have one hand with a gun in it?'' Durden said.<ep>
   Witnesses said the problem started when Mitchell was attacked by a group of people while riding a bicycle along Northwest Sixth Avenue. On Tuesday, residents of the quiet Northwest Hallandale neighborhood said Mitchell had stolen the bike. The fight was a result of some residents trying to reclaim it. Police couldn't verify the story.<ep>
   Mitchell's criminal record includes convictions for arson and criminal mischief. He was sentenced in 1989 to 3 1/2 years in state prison but was released after seven months. He is on probation until May 2001.<ep>
   He was not arrested Monday. Mitchell refused to comment Tuesday on the advice of his lawyer.<ep>
   While onlookers reacted with outrage to the shooting Monday evening, on Tuesday neighborhood leaders called for calm (--) but demanded an investigation.<ep>
   ``We realized that basically that was a mistake [Monday],'' said John Hardwick, president of the Northwest Hallandale Civic Association. ``We need to investigate and be more understanding that mistakes do happen. By the same token, we don't tolerate anyone being mistreated.''<ep>
   Roaden, a 13-year veteran, has been suspended with pay from her approximately $45,000-a-year job while the shooting is reviewed. She is prohibited from publicly discussing the shooting.<ep>
   Roaden's weapon (--) a .40-caliber Glock (--) comes from a family of weapons with a reputation for unintentional firings.<ep>
   While Metro-Dade prohibits the use of Glocks, the light-weight weapon is popular in many departments, including the Miami Police Department, said Armando Valdes, senior firearms instructor for Miami police.<ep>
   Glocks used by Miami require eight pounds of pressure to pull the trigger. Five is standard. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``We felt five pounds was a little too light,'' Valdes said.<ep>
   A Glock adjusted for competition shooting needs only 3.5 pounds to fire, he said.<ep>
   Even with the less sensitive weapons, Miami officers are trained to keep their fingers off the triggers unless they intend to shoot.<ep>
   Tests showed that reaction times varied less than a second for finger on-the-trigger and finger off-the-trigger practice shooting, Valdes said.<ep>
   Another reason for off-trigger training is something called ``sympathetic contractions.'' It happens, Valdes said, when you're startled, when you loose your balance or when you exert yourself.<ep>
   ``We did this experiment where we had an officer hold an egg in one hand, then hold heavy books in the other hand,'' he said.<ep>
   As the weight of the books increased, the hand holding the egg tightened (--) eventually cracking the egg.<ep>
   ``What one hand does, the other hand imitates,'' he said. ``That's why we modified our training.''<ep>
   Commander George Long, a weapons expert at Broward's Criminal Justice Institute, said the .40-caliber Glock is a popular weapon and no more dangerous than any other semi-automatic.<ep>
   Recruits at the academy are taught to hold unholstered weapons in two positions: firing position at a target, firing position at the ground.<ep>
   ``It's in order to teach control of the weapon,'' he said. ``You have to know how hard it is to pull the trigger.''<ep>
   But, Long said, recruits are also taught to put the gun in their holster before trying to handcuff a suspect.<ep>
