   Six pending rape cases in Broward. The brutal rape of a 14-year-old Cooper City girl. And the inability of the Florida Legislature to rein in the drug at the heart of it all.<P>

   This was the fuel Broward State Attorney Michael J. Satz used to urge Florida's top lawyer to consider reclassifying Rohypnol, or roofies, as a highly dangerous drug.<P>

   ``The law enforcement community throughout the state wants it rescheduled,'' said Marty Moore, deputy general counsel to the attorney general. ``Attorney General Bob Butterworth supports them.''<P>

Satz asked Butterworth to consider the change after the state Senate this year failed to pass a bill that would reclassify the drug. Instead, the Legislature simply stiffened the penalties for a drug that is still labeled low-risk. <P>

   ``The Florida prosecuting attorneys have taken the position that this language is unworkable,'' Moore said.<P>

   While doing little to stop the flow of the drug into the country, the current legal arrangement has the potential to become a prosecutor's nightmare. <P>

   ``Someone can come along and challenge it and say, `Hey, look, it's a Schedule Four [lower-risk] drug. How can you chisel out one particular drug and give it Schedule One penalties?' '' Satz said.<P>

   Satz maintains the drug is extremely dangerous and, because it's not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, has no currently accepted medical use in the United States. Miami drug agents have seized 136,107 Rohypnol tablets this year, three times that in all of 1995. <P>

     The drug has been used in connection with several rape cases in Broward. It takes effect in 10 to 15 minutes and lasts up to eight hours. The drug impairs motor functions, reaction time and mental judgment and tends to cause amnesia.<P>

   ``Our office has six pending sexual battery cases which are directly linked to roofies . . . It's an example of how dangerous a drug this can be,'' Satz said.<P>

   ``It has been used by perpetrators of crime to further their criminal activity.''<P>

   Butterworth announced Wednesday he will hold a hearing on roofies at 10 a.m. June 17 at the Broward County Courthouse.<P>

   The drug's manufacturer, Hoffman-LaRoche, argued that reclassifying the drug as a dangerous narcotic would hurt sales in the 64 countries where Rohypnol is legally sold.<P>

   ``I find it hard to believe that people in other countries look to the Florida Legislature or the Florida attorney general to determine which drugs to use,'' said Rep. Tracy Stafford, D-Wilton Manors, who sponsored legislation to change the drug's definition to one that has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. <P>

   A provision in the Florida statutes authorizes the attorney general to reclassify drugs. In the past, the statute has more often been used to decrease a drug's potential for harm than to increase it, Moore said.
