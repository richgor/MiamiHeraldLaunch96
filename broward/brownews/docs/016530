<m0>   The Old Davie School Foundation will host its first Helicopter Ball Drop fund-raiser at noon Friday at the Rolling Hills Country Club. Tickets cost $10.<ep>
   Each ticket number corresponds to a numbered golf ball. The balls will be dropped from a helicopter onto the golf course, in a designated zone with a flag at the center. Those with the six balls closest to the flag will win cash prizes up to $1,000.<ep>
   All proceeds will aid in restoring the Old Davie School, the oldest schoolhouse in Broward, at 6650 Griffin Rd. Built in 1918, the school closed in the late 1970s and is in the final stages of restoration.<ep>
   The Old Davie School Foundation, the nonprofit committee that oversees the school and its activities, has rebuilt four classrooms on the first floor. For more information, call 797-1044.<m1><ql>
