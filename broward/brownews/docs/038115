<m0>   A 25-year-old Fort Lauderdale man was shot to death as he pedaled his bicycle home after buying groceries for his aunt.<ep>
   Ylienes Fleurinord, 25, died on the sidewalk at the corner of Northeast Fourth Avenue and 12th Street, said police spokesman Clint Ward. Fleurinord was shot at least once and possibly twice about 100 feet north of the Aurore Market. A white plastic sack and a loaf of bread lay on the street near the body of Fleurinord, who lived at 1407 NE 14th St., Ward said.<ep>
   Fleurinord's aunt lives nearby and had sent him to the store for groceries, Ward said. Police were called about 8:45 p.m. to the scene after someone reported shots had been fired. The killer apparently took Fleurinord's bicycle, Ward said. But it's unclear whether anything else was taken, he said.<ep>
   Police are looking for a white van occupied by two men who may have witnessed the shooting but drove away, Ward said.<ep>
