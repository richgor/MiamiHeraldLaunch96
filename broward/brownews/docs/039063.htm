  They gave life to the proposed city of Weston, but the same old problem -- too many needs, too little money -- hampered Broward lawmakers in the annual legislative session that ended early Saturday in Tallahassee.<P>

   For the first time this decade, lawmakers raised the share of tax dollars to schools, and they congratulated themselves for doing so, especially after voters in Broward and many other counties had rejected higher taxes for schools.<P>

   ``The rich years are over. This is a respectable budget for us,'' said Georgia Slack, the lobbyist for Broward schools.<P>

   Although the state budget gives Broward 2.5 percent more money, or about $89 more per student, parents and students may not notice much of a difference in a county besieged by growth. Most of the new money will pay for new students, not improving conditions for the ones already here.<P>

   Some lawmakers tried. This was the third straight year builders and real estate agents helped defeat a measure that would have required new home buyers to pay higher closing costs to help pay for new schools.<P>

   ``Sooner or later, we're going to wake up,'' said Rep. John Rayson, D-Pompano Beach. ``I know it's not popular, but people can't have no taxes and a lot of services.''<P>

   Even in a no-new-taxes budget, there are winners.<P>

   Who won? Racetrack bettors, who can bet on poker while wagering on piped-in TV races from tracks around the country; sports kingpin H. Wayne Huizenga, who owns a big chunk of a small company that would benefit from a new law allowing hair-testing for drugs; and the people of Weston, who will decide on Sept. 3 whether to form Broward's 29th city. The Senate gave final approval to the Weston charter at 11:53 p.m. Friday, sending it to the governor.<P>

   Who lost? Disabled people, whose state-subsidized public transportation program was cut by $23 million; squeezed-in students, who got no relief in alleviating Broward's shortage of classrooms; and county taxpayers, who will keep paying for operations of an increasingly crowded court system that, by law, is the state's responsibility.<P>

   For the first time in a political career that spans three decades, Sen. Howard Forman voted against the budget. He said cutbacks will result in bigger caseloads for human-service employees, fewer child-abuse investigators and fewer rides for the elderly and disabled.<P>

   ``Although I'm a lone wolf on this vote, someone still has to stand up and say that what happened to health and human services this year is wrong,'' the Pembroke Pines Democrat said. ``It's going to hurt all over.''<P>

   Slashing human services by $180 million in the nation's fastest-growing state only postpones the inevitable, Forman said. ``The problem is going to get worse. It's not going to go away.''<BR>
  Now the waiting begins. Gov. Lawton Chiles repeatedly has hinted he might veto portions of the budget he considers inadequate to meet the basic needs of many Floridians. ``I'm very disappointed about the budget,'' Chiles said Saturday.<P>

   In the state that leads the U.S. in boating-related accidents, Rayson passed a boating-safety education program that for years had been deep-sixed by conservative lawmakers.<P>

   With Broward home to three tracks for thoroughbreds, greyhounds and harness racing, a jai-alai fronton, it's a bettors' market, and this was the year to help a parimutuel industry struggling to compete with the lottery, floating casinos and sports. Parimutuels pump $100 million a year into the state treasury, so the more people gamble, the more money the state gets.<P>

   Rep. Steve Geller, D-Hallandale, devised a bill that expands gambling sources by adding poker-betting rooms and TV simulcasts of racing programs from other tracks.<P>

   Rep. Josephus Eggelletion Jr., D-Lauderdale Lakes, helped craft a welfare reform bill that requires able-bodied recipients to find jobs. The bill also expands state-supported child care so single mothers could work.<P>

   ``We did a welfare reform bill that's very tough, but it deals with our most precious gift, our children, in a very fair way,'' Eggelletion said.<BR>
   The 400-page budget pays for a variety of Broward programs, from beach renourishment to kosher meals to a $5 million venture that encourages the Broward school system to get on the information highway.<P>

   The innovative program would wire schools with computers linked to other schools, community colleges and universities. It's the brainchild of Tom Gustafson, a former House speaker from Fort Lauderdale and a technology expert.<P>

   Although the $5 million grant doesn't mention Broward, the county is poised to take advantage because it already meets some of the criteria to get the money. <P>

   ``The language is crafted such that Broward would have an advantage in terms of the work they've already done,'' said Rep. Buzz Ritchie, D-Pensacola, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
