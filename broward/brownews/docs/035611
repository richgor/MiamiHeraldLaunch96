   Michael J. Peter, Cornell University graduate, rose to riches his own way, mixing pricey liquor, naked women and business savvy. For 20 years, his strip clubs have sprung up in Florida and beyond, luring customers with upscale entertainment.<ep>
   For 20 years, the law has shadowed him. Always, he walked away unscathed.<ep>
   ``This gave Peter a reputation of invincibility,'' says a U.S. Department of Justice memo headed <m0>Operation Naked Dollars<m0>.<ep>
   Maybe no more.<ep>
   In West Palm Beach federal court Friday, Peter sat in the defendant's chair as his attorney Roy Black and the U.S. attorney's office announced they had come to terms on a plea agreement.<ep>
   The deal, cut one month before Peter was to stand trial on a 10-count indictment, would have him serve a two-year prison term, pay a $25,000 fine and give up his liquor licenses and strip clubs. He'd plead guilty to one racketeering charge. The government would drop the other nine charges.<ep>
   There's an unusual twist: Peter, 48, wouldn't have to surrender to federal authorities until January. In the interim, he'd be freed from house arrest, be free to drink liquor and be permitted to travel to conduct his business affairs.<ep>
   The reason: to allow Peter to sell off his assets, with the proceeds going to pay off a multimillion dollar civil lawsuit hanging over his head.<ep>
   ``He will need some time,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence LaVecchio told the judge Friday. ``And he can't do that from jail.''<ep>
   Because Peter already spent five months behind bars awaiting trial, he'd likely serve less than a year and a half in prison. Once out, he would serve two years on supervised release.<ep>
   It's not set in stone, however. U.S. District Judge Daniel T.K. Hurley, given the plea deal Friday, said he needs time before approving it. Hurley ordered a presentence investigation by the U.S. probation department.<ep>
   The judge admitted being taken aback by the sudden turn of events in a case that fills several feet of court files.<ep>
   If the case went to trial, Peter would face 10 federal charges that essentially accuse him of two types of crimes:<ep>
   (box) One, that he allowed a convicted felon and organized-crime figures to maintain hidden ownerships in his Broward strip clubs (--) and paid those figures $500 a week cash under the table.<ep>
   (box) Two, that he repeatedly strong-armed competitors and colleagues. The indictment recounts five alleged instances of extortion (--) with Peter threatening to have the fingers crushed of one man recruiting his dancers, threatening to expose ``secrets'' of another man he reportedly owes millions of dollars.<ep>
   Court papers say Peter claims to own or manage 50 adult entertainment clubs grossing $100 million a year. Among them: Solid Gold and Pure Platinum in Fort Lauderdale, Thee Dollhouse in Pompano Beach, Solid Gold and La Bare in North Miami Beach (--) and clubs in Orlando, New York, Minneapolis, Providence, Myrtle Beach, Chicago and Honolulu.<ql>
