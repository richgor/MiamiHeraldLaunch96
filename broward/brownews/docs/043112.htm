  Weston and Bonaventure are already buzzing about the possibility of creating a new city or cities.<P>

   And the talk will only get louder, thanks to the Florida Legislature's decision this past week to allow Weston to incorporate and to allow Bonaventure to join Weston or the city of Sunrise, depending what voters decide in two separate referendums.<P>

   You'll hear it today at three public meetings in both neighborhoods.<P>

   In Bonaventure, the issue will be raised at the monthly meeting of the Presidents Council, a group of condo presidents. And in Weston, the Indian Trace Community Development District Board of Supervisors will have its first meeting since its victory in Tallahassee. The board was the prime force behind the drive to create a city of Weston.<P>

   The group that has been Indian Trace's opponent also will meet Monday ``to tell the real story,'' says Nick Sakhnovsky of Concerned Citizens for a Better Weston, a political action committee.<P>

   Soon, all the talk will turn into action.<P>

   In the next few weeks, look for a pro-city-of-Weston political action committee to be formed, says Indian Trace Supervisor John Flint.<P>

   The PAC will try to persuade voters to vote for incorporation on Sept. 3. ``We're under a moral and ethical obligation to make sure everybody fully understands what the future's going to bring for Weston,'' Flint says.<P>

   All summer long, Flint and other supervisors say they'll be ready and eager to make speeches, attend rallies or answer questions from any organization or any of Weston's 15,000 residents who want to talk about incorporation.<P>

   ``We'll be very, very visible. We'll have to run this like a campaign,'' says Indian Trace Supervisor Eric Hersh.<P>

   So far, the idea of creating a city of Weston seems to be a big hit there. But Concerned Citizens' Sakhnovsky said he'll be speaking out as often as possible about the group's opposition to the city charter and election schedule. Concerned Citizens has 100 members.<P>

   The debate also will be heated in Bonaventure.<P>

   Voters there will have to make a choice between joining Weston or Sunrise on April 1 next year.<P>

   The Bonaventure Presidents Council already has discussed hiring some sort of expert to study both offers.<P>

   ``If the board wants to do that, we'll form a search committee to find an impartial party,'' says Ed Jacobson, head of the Presidents Council.<P>

   A pro-Sunrise PAC, called Best Deal for Bonaventure, was organized there five months ago. Its efforts will rev up shortly, says member Erwin Greenberg, and intensify after Weston votes in September.<P>

   Bonaventure Homeowners Association President Murray Chermak mailed straw ballots to 650 single-family homes and 60 Bonaventure condo association presidents last month.<P>

   The results: Weston, overwhelmingly. So far, he's received 264 single-family home ``votes'' for Weston and 10 for Sunrise and 39 condo presidents for Weston and 3 for Sunrise.<P>

   Greenberg said he expects those results to change considerably once the ``free exchange of information'' begins.<P>

   ``I'm looking forward to April 1,'' said Chermak, a Weston supporter.
