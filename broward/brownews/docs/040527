<m1><ue5><m0>Police seek brother of shooting victim<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   Homicide detectives continued looking for answers Monday in the weekend shooting death of Alejandro Lopez.<ep>
   Lopez, 43, was found dead inside the bedroom in his home at 516 SW 14th Ct. in Fort Lauderdale early Sunday morning, said homicide Sgt. Tim Bronson.<ep>
   Fort Lauderdale police got a call from Lopez's sister about 2:15 a.m. Sunday. She said another brother had called her and told her that Alejandro had been shot. Police went to the residence and found the bedroom door locked, Bronson said.<ep>
   ``They kicked the door down. He was dead in the room,'' Bronson said.<ep>
   Police talked to the brother who made the call about the shooting, but they continued their search Monday for another brother, Antonio Lopez, and a nephew, Jaime Lopez, Bronson said.<ep>
   ``We believe a fight or argument ensued in the apartment,'' Bronson said. ``They were there. We certainly want to talk to them.''<ep>
   Anyone with information is asked to call homicide detectives John King or John Curcio at 761-5700. <m1><ql>
