<m0>   Lennar Homes officials said Friday they will not buy 20 homes on the Hampshire Homes sinkhole, as residents have demanded.<ep>
   ``If Ford Motor Company has a problem with a car, it doesn't give people new cars. It issues a recall and fixes the cars,'' said Allan Pekor, Lennar's financial vice president. ``We will do a detailed inspection and we will fix people's homes.''<ep>
   Homeowners decided Thursday to demand that Lennar buy the 20 homes and do soil tests of all 307 houses. They are also demanding that the developer install new siding on all homes, resod lawns and set up an escrow account to repay homeowners who cannot sell their homes at fair market value.<ep>
   The plan was proposed by Andre Melton, president of the homeowners association, who will discuss it with Lennar executives next week.<ep>
   Pekor said Friday he would sit down with homeowners to discuss the siding issue.<ep>
   Homeowners have complained of deteriorating siding. Setting up an escrow account, however, is ``not under consideration,'' Pekor said.<ep>
   Melton said he would not back down on the issue of a buyout of the 20 homes or any of the other issues.<ep>
   ``All I've been hearing from homeowners today is `stand strong and we're behind you,' '' said Melton.<ep>
   William Holderby, who lives on the sinkhole, said Friday he was not surprised at Lennar's response.<ep>
   ``That's going to land them in court,'' he said. ``I knew they were going to laugh at the proposal. If they won't go along with the buyout of the homes, then they're not going to go along with the rest of it.''<ql>
