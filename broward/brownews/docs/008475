<m0>  Broward County commissioners have given themselves and the Florida Panthers an extra month to sign a binding lease for a new hockey arena.<ep>
   The lease was to have been signed by May 1, but negotiations got a late start and have taken longer than expected. So commissioners on Tuesday amended the letter of intent the county signed with the hockey team last month to extend that deadline until June 1.<ep>
   That gives the county time to complete the lengthy technical documents and gives commissioners a week to read them.<ep>
   Commissioners Suzanne Gunzburger and Lori Parrish opposed the extension, saying they want the project on a faster track.<ep>
   They worried about completing the project for the 1998 season if talks dragged on, and said they weren't inclined to slow down because the team has rushed the county in the past.<ep>
   ``We stopped everything and did the arena because we had to move, move, move,'' complained Parrish. ``This doesn't make sense to me.''<ep>
   County officials say talks are going smoothly but, because of their technical nature, will take more time than anticipated. And they say that the rush is off now that the team has signed a binding letter of intent and all parties have agreed to move forward.<ep>
   Panthers spokesman Stan Smith said the team doesn't think extending the deadline will throw it off track (--) and prefers not to rush documents it'll have to live with for 30 years. <ep>
   The commission also deferred a decision on earmarking for tourism any profits the county makes from the $212 million arena. Commissioners want to give hoteliers a chance to speak on the topic.<ql>
