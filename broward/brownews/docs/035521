<m0>   The fate of South Florida's creakiest psychiatric hospital remains murky since state legislators couldn't come up with plans to downsize and privatize the 355-bed Pembroke Pines facility.<ep>
   The Legislature gave its blessing for a smaller, possibly privately run hospital, but left the nuts and bolts of how that would happen in bureaucratic hands. It will be up to the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to figure out what to do about South Florida State Hospital.<ep>
   ``There's no mandate here,'' Rep. Debby Sanderson, R-Fort Lauderdale, vice chairwoman of the appropriations committee, said. ``Nothing is going to happen right away. We have no intention of turning people out into the streets.''<ep>
   HRS Secretary Ed Feaver is analyzing the mental health budget and does not yet know where the new legislative flexibility will lead, HRS spokeswoman Michelle Lagos said.<ep>
   ``There are a lot of unanswered questions at this point,'' Lagos said. ``What this does is allows the department to move forward on a plan to scale down South Florida State Hospital. There are a lot of caveats.''<ep>
   In the state budget passed early Saturday, the Legislature said HRS may begin to replace facilities at South Florida State Hospital with a private psychiatric facility with conditions: patient welfare and public safety cannot suffer; released patients must have access to suitable community mental health programs; hospital clients must be kept near family whenever possible; and hospital employees should be given opportunities for other state employment.<ep>
   ``We now have some sense as to where we stand,'' SFSH hospital administrator Thomas Gramley said. ``We now know what will be expected of us. I think the Legislature has outlined very nicely the concerns for the well-being of the residents and the staff.''<ep>
   South Florida State Hospital, which opened on Feb. 27, 1957, to treat South Florida residents with chronic psychiatric problems, has fallen into disrepair. After its patients sued in federal court alleging inhumane conditions and inadequate treatment at the hospital, HRS agreed to make sweeping improvements.<ep>
    The hospital, which serves Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe counties, is already filled to capacity. HRS studies show the area needs 511 psychiatric beds to meet community needs.<ep>
   ``We have to do something,'' said State Sen. Howard Forman, D-Pembroke Pines. ``These buildings were built when Eisenhower was president. We know now that a large institution is not the best place to administer mental health treatment.''<ep>
   Legislators latched on to the notion of downsizing and private management during the 1995 legislative session after Specialty Corp., a Miami firm that wants to build the new hospital, suggested a privately built and run hospital would save money. The firm hired former U.S. Rep. Larry Smith to sell the idea to state lawmakers.<ep>
   On orders from the Legislature, HRS and mental health advocacy committees met for eight months to devise a privatization and downsizing plan for the hospital. The plan did not address whether privatizing would work.<ep>
   The plan suggested the state could save $5 million by shrinking the hospital population to 170 patients. But it warned that without reinvesting that money in the community to build a mental health support system that would ease residents back into society, downsizing would be a disaster.<ep>
   ``There isn't any question that the hospital itself could be smaller, but only if small systems of support are developed within the community,'' said Marcia Beach, executive director of the Advocacy Center for Persons with Disabilities.<ep>
   The Legislature wants mental health treatment to shift from institutionalization to small, community-based programs, Forman said.<ep>
   ``I think HRS and the people, the mental health advocates in South Florida, ought to put their heads together and think of the best way to serve the mental health needs,'' Forman said.<ql>
