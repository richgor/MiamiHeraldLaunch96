<m0>   The possible sale of the Florida Panthers to an out-of-town buyer won't affect Broward's plans to build a $212 million arena.<ep>
   County officials weren't surprised at reports that Panthers owner Wayne Huizenga is negotiating to sell Dallas businessman John Spano a majority stake in the hockey team. The county's deal is with the team, not Huizenga, so Spano would be locked into the terms of the county's existing deal with the Panthers.<ep>
   County Commissioner Scott Cowan said Friday it makes little difference to him whether it's Spano's millions or Huizenga's that stand behind the deal since the county would be assured of the financial wherewithal of either party.<ep>
   ``We're still going to go through the numbers,'' said Cowan. ``The numbers are all we really care about.''<ep>
   Huizenga, who brought the project this far and is now busy finalizing the details of the Broward deal, would stay on as a minority partner.<ep>
   The final details of that deal haven't been worked out. Broward is in the middle of lease negotiations with the Panthers and this week gave itself until June 1 to reach agreement on a lease and other related documents.<ep>
   One unresolved issue in those negotiations is the recent rise in interest rates that could increase the annual cost to pay back bond holders (--) now estimated at $15 million a year.<ep>
   Because the county's contribution is capped at about $10 million, the team would have to absorb any additional costs, said county Finance Director Phil Allen.<ep>
   But at the team's request, the county is considering ways to reduce the costs, he said. One way to do that is to issue some of the bonds as tax-free, but there's a limit to how much of that can be done legally and still allow the county to take some of the profits.<ep>
   Another way to go is with a variable-rate bond issue at first and then lock in interest later at a lower rate.<ql>
