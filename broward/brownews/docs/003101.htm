  Sunshine Ranches homeowners received a short reprieve from AT&T's plans for a 75-foot cellular tower topped by three crosses. The Pembroke Pines Planning and Zoning Board Thursday delayed a vote on the tower until the second week in August. Board members said they wanted to wait for recommendations from a city and county task force reviewing tower regulations.<P>

   Some Sunshine Ranches homeowners, however, wanted the board simply to reject the tower, which would be located next to Abundant Living Ministries, 14331 Sheridan St.<P>

   ``We would rather they had come to a vote and denied it,'' said Sunshine Ranches resident Anne Vitale.<P>

   Nearly 50 homeowners from the rural unincorporated neighborhood turned out to oppose the project and presented 100 signatures from neighbors who don't want the AT&T tower near their homes. The tower is planned next to the church in Pembroke Pines but within Sunshine Ranches. The church, which has agreed to lease part of its land to the telephone conglomerate, wants it topped with three crosses.<P>

   Sunshine Ranches homeowners say the tower doesn't fit in the neighborhood where homes sit on large lots and people take their horses out for walks. They say the tower will destroy the country lifestyle that lured them to Sunshine Ranches, a 400-home community between Sheridan Street and Griffin Road and Flamingo and Volunteer roads.<P>

   ``It fits in like a bloody boil on someone's nose,'' wrote Sunshine Ranches resident Inga Holm in a letter read to the Planning and Zoning Board.<P>

   Residents also are concerned about safety. <P>

   But the site is as good as any in Pines, according to city codes. <P>

   Company representatives said the tower would not be taller than the 120-foot-high street lights near I-75 and Sheridan and would be hidden by the forest of trees in Sunshine Ranches. They promised to meet with homeowners to address their concerns.
