<m0>   The Bonaventure Presidents Council unanimously voted on Monday to form a committee to find an independent consultant to help them choose between alignment with Sunrise or Weston.<ep>
   The council (--) a group of condo presidents (--) voted to hire its own expert despite an offer by state Sen. Howard Foreman to help find a non-partisan expert.<ep>
   ``We will hire. We will pay, and we will advise,'' said council president Edwin Jacobson at the regular monthly presidents' meeting at Bonaventure Town Center.<ep>
   Jacobson first appointed the committee during the Monday meeting, and then asked for the council to ratify his choice. The council agreed to form a search committee that includes Jacobson, Ted Elefter, a Bonaventure Homeowners Association representative, and Patricia Schiller, a condo president.<ep>
   ``This board should have an opportunity to hire someone totally independent, not responsible to anybody,'' said Jacobson in response to an offer by Phyllis Berens, president of the Bonaventure Weston Area Democratic Club. Berens told the council that Foreman authorized her to inform the council that he could make arrangements for an independent study.<ep>
   Berens said David Sigerson, director of the Broward Delegation Office, and Marie York of Florida Atlantic University would meet Friday to talk about how to set up an independent comparison of the proposals of Sunrise and Weston to incorporate Bonaventure into their cities. She said York did the study of Aventura before it incorporated.<ep>
