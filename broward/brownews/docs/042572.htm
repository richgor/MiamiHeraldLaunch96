  They're talking taxes again at the Broward School Board.<P>

   A day after enrollment projections revealed that at least 30 schools will be critically crowded in the fall -- with 18 more teetering just a few students away from the crisis label -- a majority of School Board members said Friday there is only one long-term solution:<P>

   Asking voters to approve a penny tax or bond issue, possibly as early as next spring.<P>

   Board member Diana Wasserman spent Friday answering calls from parents concerned about crowding. Her district includes Weston, where every school made the critical list, a designation that means parents likely will soon have to choose from unpopular antidotes such as year-round schools, double sessions and enrollment caps.<P>

   By late in the afternoon, Wasserman sounded weary.<P>

   ``In my opinion, it can't be much longer at all before we go back to the public for money,'' she said. ``If we could do it tomorrow, we should, but there's such a thing as feasibility.''<P>

   Translation: Before the School Board rattles the tin cup again, enough time has to elapse from the crushing defeat of the district's last plea for money. That was in September, when 71 percent voted against a penny sales tax for school construction.<P>

   Board members say they learned many lessons from the defeat. One that looms large is that they'll have to run a smarter campaign to be successful. The other is that ``tax'' has become such a dirty word, that asking again for an increase in the sales tax might be futile.<P>

   Wasserman, along with board members Bob Parks, Abe Fischler and Miriam Oliphant, are leaning toward a general obligation bond referendum, perhaps as early as March 1997. Voters would be asked to give the board permission to sell bonds that would raise a large lump sum of cash that would be paid back over 20 or 30 years.<P>

   ``People seem to be more comfortable with the idea of a bond issue,'' Fischler said.<P>

   The district's last successful bond-issue referendum was in 1987. If a bond-issue campaign is to be successful now, Fischler said, School Board members will have to take the lead in selling the idea to the public.<P>

   During the penny tax campaign, the board abdicated that role to County Commissioner John Hart, state Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz and Superintendent Frank Petruzielo. The idea was that if board members avoided the spotlight, voters wouldn't use the ballot to take revenge against the School Board for all the things they were steamed at -- from forced busing for desegregation to the $24 million for the district's Fort Lauderdale headquarters.<BR>
Working on image<P>

   ``It was a strategy that backfired,'' Parks said.<P>

    Since the defeat, the school district has been working to rehabilitate its image. Many parent activists have said in recent months they've seem improvement, that board members and Petruzielo are more willing now to listen to the public's concerns and opinions. Board members are hoping the good will, coupled with the frustration parents are feeling over half-day kindergarten and the specter of year-round schooling, will make voters more willing to approve a bond issue or tax.<P>

   Parks predicts the School Board will begin seriously exploring the issue of a new plea in September, and board members will begin taking the case to the public shortly after that.<P>

   ``The demographics don't show that there's any end in sight to this growth,'' he said. ``That's the reality. The rabbit can only be pulled out of the hat so many times.''<P>

   The school district will continue to pursue creative solutions with developers, trying to convince the builders that it's in their own best interest to put up small primary learning centers to ease some of the crowding.<BR>
Hoping for commitments<P>

   Wasserman met with builders earlier this week and is hoping to get some commitments soon. Fischler has asked a developer building homes on the land once designated for Blockbuster Park to commit to an eight-classroom center for every 250 homes.<P>

   ``They haven't gotten back to me yet,'' he said. ``But I told them it would add about $1,000 onto the price of each home and they'd be able to tell buyers, `Your little children can go to school here, in the neighborhood.' ''<P>

   Even if all those things pan out, they won't add up to a long-term solution.<P>

    ``At best, they'll buy us some time so we can put together a campaign the right way,'' Wasserman said.<P>

   Petruzielo agrees.<P>

   But he says the district is in for ``tough sledding'' even if a bond issue or tax were to pass next spring.<P>

   ``The results of that -- new schools -- wouldn't be apparent until 1999 or 2000,'' he said.<BR>
Unpleasant remedies<P>

   Meanwhile, parents and students would still have to contend with double-sessions, year-round schooling, enrollment capping and other unpleasant remedies. Last year, all but a handful of the 25 schools on the critically overcrowded list chose to do nothing about crowding instead of picking one of the remedies. Petruzielo and the board agreed to let the schools have their way, but say it's unlikely they'll do the same again.<P>

   This fall, three elementary schools will have to contend with half-day kindergarten, a reality that has left parents furious. He said more schools would be affected in the 1997-98 school year.<P>

   ``There's no desire on my part or the part of the School Board to make the school experience any less comfortable for parents and students than the crowding already makes it,'' Petruzielo said. ``We're going to continue to work with the communities and with parents, but we've really reached the point of no return.<P>

   ``You just can't squeeze any more blood from this turnip.''
