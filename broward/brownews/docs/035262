<m0>  Tony Rode and Angel de la Rosa say many of the charges levied against them by Hollywood police investigators are unfair and riddled with inaccuracies.<ep>
   They were each accused of multiple violations of state law, plus between 80 and 115 violations of police procedures.<ep>
   Here are some of the charges and Rode's responses:<ep>
   (box) Failing to include copies of college transcripts in the personnel files of candidates.<ep>
   <m0>Rode's response: <m0>In some cases where transcripts were allegedly missing, the applicant never attended college.<ep>
   (box) Failing to conduct checks of driving histories in all states where candidates lived.<ep>
   <m0>Rode's response: <m0>In some cases where the records were allegedly missing, the candidate never lived in the state permanently. They were only there temporarily on military assignment or for short-term training and never got new licenses.<ep>
   (box) Failing to conduct new background checks on candidates already working for the department as corrections officers.<ep>
   <m0>Rode's response: <m0>Department policy allowed investigators to update the file, instead of starting from scratch.<ep>
   (box) Failing to contact the neighbors of an applicant who lived in Homestead before Hurricane Andrew.<ep>
   <m0>Rode's response: <m0>Investigators tried, but the people had left because their houses were wiped out. Instead, they checked with Homestead police.<ep>
   (box) Failing to include copies of background records in the applicant's file, such as criminal histories or driver's license checks.<ep>
   <m0>Rode's response: <m0>In some cases the information was there, but in a different form that wasn't recognized by the person reviewing the files.<ep>
   (box) Violating procedures in connection with the hiring of officers whose applications and paperwork he did not review or approve.<ep>
   <m0>Rode's response: <m0>At the time they were hired, he was either on vacation or away at training seminars.<ep>
   (box) Failing to properly review polygraph examinations given to candidates.<ep>
   <m0>Rode's response: <m0>Half were screened and hired before he took over supervision of the personnel unit on July 8, 1991.<ql>
