<m0>  Curriculum may not be the only change at Broward's Nova schools this fall.<ep>
   Students at the four-school Nova complex could be changing out of baggy jeans and sun dresses and into green and gold shirts and khaki shorts.<ep>
   This week, administrators at the Davie schools (--) Nova Dwight D. Eisenhower and Nova Blanche Forman elementaries, Nova Middle, and Nova High (--) sent home surveys asking parents how they feel about participating in a one-year experimental school uniform program this fall. Uniforms are just one of several changes in the works at the Nova schools that focus on better ways to teach kids.<ep>
   ``There is a lot of research that supports the benefit of school uniforms for both academic achievement and behavior,'' said Linda McDaniel, principal of Nova Blanche Forman Elementary, 3521 David Rd.<ep>
   McDaniel and her colleagues at the other Nova schools decided to send out the surveys after a parents group brought the idea to their attention. Each school has pinned uniform samples on office bulletin boards to give students an idea of what the fashions look like.<ep>
   Before uniforms can become an option at any of the Nova schools, Broward School Board guidelines require that the measure be approved by 51 percent of the parents at each school.<ep>
   If the parents say OK, one or more of the Nova schools will join dozens of Broward and Dade schools in giving students the option of wearing uniforms. Last fall, 46 schools in Dade started a mandatory uniform policy.<ep>
   Optional or not, the idea isn't fashionable to some Nova students.<ep>
   ``I don't like it one bit,'' said Aaron Greenbarg, 11, of Hollywood, a fifth-grader at Nova Blanche Forman Elementary.<ep>
   Classmate Chantal Fowles, also 11, said she doesn't mind wearing the green and gold combo when she gets to Nova Middle next year, but high school is out of the question.<ep>
   ``That's the time you want to stand out and do something different, not be like everyone else,'' said Chantal, a fifth-grader who lives in Coral Springs.<ep>
   Some parents like the idea, citing research that shows uniforms promote school pride and help to improve self-esteem.<ep>
   Nova parent Mary Ann Edwards, who is pushing for the change, said the uniforms also will help keep kids safe at school.<ep>
   ``In these changing times, a lot of parents are thinking of school safety,'' Edwards said. ``We're an open campus and school uniforms are a way for us to identify the students that belong at our school.''<ql>
