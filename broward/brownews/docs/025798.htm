<H2>Man, 20, shot to death over unpaid bet</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 An unpaid $10 bet was the cause of a Monday night shooting near Fort Lauderdale, police say.<P>

   Jermaine Hall, 21, of 2851 NW 15th St., and Andrew Williams, 16, of the same address, were charged with first-degree murder in the death of Shelton Jackson, 20, of 2800 W. Sunrise Blvd.<P>

   Broward Sheriff's Office spokesman Jim Leljedal said Hall and Williams arrived at Jackson's house shortly before 8 p.m. According to witnesses, the two got out of the car and talked to Jackson, who had lost a $10 bet with Williams in a bicycle race and refused to pay.<P>

   Hall returned to the car, got a 9mm handgun, and handed it to Williams. He pointed the gun at the victim's head and pulled the trigger, but the gun jammed. Williams cleared it and fired again, killing Jackson instantly, police said.<P>

   Hall is being held without bail at the Broward County Jail. Williams is being held at the Regional Juvenile Detention Center.

  It's Nick at night on Ventana de Broward, as former Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro makes an appearance today on the weekly television talk show that focuses on Hispanic issues.<P>

   The half-hour show will air at 8:30 tonight on WCTD-Channel 35, said producer/director Alex Pino of AP Video Productions in Hollywood.<P>

   The program's host will be Carlos Reyes, president of the Latin Chamber of Commerce of Broward. In the taped program, Navarro talks about his stint as Broward sheriff from 1985-92. He also touches on some of the controversy surrounding his career as Broward sheriff, including the arrest of rappers 2 Live Crew in 1990 for a raunchy performance at a Hollywood nightclub, Pino said. A jury later acquitted the rappers.

  Lauderhill police are investigating the rape of a 13-year-old girl who was attacked in a bathroom near the police department, spokeswoman Lucy Crockett said.<P>

   The girl and a friend were approached Tuesday afternoon by two boys at the Mission Lake Plaza. As the girls walked to City Hall Park, 1900 NW 55th Ave., the boys followed, Crockett said.<P>

   According to the victim, one of the boys grabbed her and pulled her into the women's restroom at the park. The second suspect held the victim's arms while the first boy removed her clothes. She was then raped by both, she told police.<P>

   A passerby found the girl a short time later and escorted her to the police department, Crockett said.

  The freighter that ran aground near Port Everglades last month did not damage coral reefs, a Broward environmental official said this week.<P>

   The 112-foot Mylia Express lodged on a shoal off Fort Lauderdale beach April 10 when its engine quit and it drifted onto the rocky shallows just north of the Port Everglades channel. The ship was freed the next day by a powerful tugboat.<P>

   The shoal that served as a brief home for the ship was made mostly of rocks, which were the debris of the dredging of Port Everglades, said Lou Fisher, natural resource specialist with the Broward Department of Natural Resource Protection.<P>

   ``They were fortunate that it was not a natural reef,'' Fisher said.<P>

   Coral colonies have grown on some of the loose rock, he said. But Fisher said he did not see any damage to those colonies.
