<m0>   Fort Lauderdale city commissioners took steps Tuesday to preserve three pieces of Broward history, but the move could erode relations between the city and the school system.<ep>
   The West Side School, North Side School and South Side School were built in the 1920s and are some of the oldest school buildings still standing in the county.<ep>
   The city's Historic Preservation Board unanimously voted to add all three to its list of historic landmarks, and the City Commission agreed.<ep>
   But Broward Schools Superintendent Frank Petruzielo opposed the designations for two of the buildings (--) West Side and South Side (--) because it would cost too much to maintain the properties in their historic facade.<ep>
   ``We all know the tight budget they're in,'' City Commissioner John Aurelius said. ``They're not going to come up with the money for historic designation.''<ep>
   Still, commissioners approved the West Side designation by a 3-2 vote (--) Commissioners Jack Latona and Cary Keno and Mayor Jim Naugle voted yes, with Aurelius and Carlton Moore voting no (--) and the North Side and South Side schools by a 4-1 vote, with Moore the lone dissenter.<ep>
   The historic designation would hamper any plans the district may have to demolish any of the historic schools and sell them to private developers.<ep>
   Now, if the district or whoever owns the property wants to raze one of the buildings, they must first get approval from the city.<ep>
   North Side, at 120 NE 11th St., is a functioning elementary school building and Petruzielo said school officials have maintained it.<ep>
   The North Side School was built in 1927 to meet northern Fort Lauderdale's growing demand for classroom space for elementary school children.<ep>
   ``This building represents the best example of our architectural history,'' Petruzielo noted.<ep>
   The South Side School is at 701 S. Andrews Ave. Built in 1922, it is the oldest school structure still standing in the city. It's partially boarded up and used as a school for emotionally disturbed and physically disabled students.<ep>
   Archaeologists think the school may have been built over the graves of some of the city's first pioneers.<ep>
   The West Side School, at 1300 SW Second Court (Harmon Street), was constructed in 1922 and 1923 as a four-room schoolhouse in a Mediterranean style. It's now vacant.<ep>
   ``We've known this is a valuable historic property for a long time,'' Latona said. ``We need to know what it would take to maintain these properties before we place that designation on them.''<ep>
   As a compromise, Petruzielo offered to deed the West Side building over to the city. But City Manager George Hanbury said his staff first must study how much it would cost to maintain the structure and other possible uses for the building.<ql>
