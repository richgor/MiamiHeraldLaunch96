<B>TRAFFIC INPUT:</B> Residents of the city's Rio Vista, Lauderdale Harbors and Harbordale-Portside neighborhoods will get a chance Tuesday to give their views on a proposed traffic reduction plan.<P>

   The area is located south of the New River and east of U.S. 1. The traffic plan is designed to reduce speeding and cut-through traffic from busy commercial areas nearby.<P>

   Speed bumps and partially closing roads and diverting traffic from various streets are among the options. Several residents have written city commissioners opposing the plan.<P>

   The public hearing will be at 5 p.m. in the commission's first-floor chambers, 100 N. Andrews Ave., Fort Lauderdale.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

<B>LEADERSHIP REVIEW:</B> The City Commission is scheduled to meet Wednesday and evaluate the performances of City Manager Sam Finz and City Attorney Jamie Cole.<P>

   Finz, who has been city manager since October 1993 and earns about $108,000, received high marks last year from commissioners.<P>

   Cole, who was hired in April 1994, also received top marks last year. Cole has been earning about $95,000 a year, plus $12,000 as legal counsel to the city's Community Redevelopment Agency.<P>

   The evaluations will take place at 10:30 a.m. at Hollywood City Hall, 2600 Hollywood Blvd.<P>

<BR>

<P>

<B>CELEBRATING A CITY:</B> Miramar Days '96 continues with a Tennis 'n Fun Tournament at 7 p.m. Thursday and a Basketball-Hot Shot contest at 7 p.m. Friday, both at Lakeshore Park, 8501 Sherman Cir. South. Then on Saturday, a 10K Run will take place at 7 a.m. at Shirley Branca Park, 6900 Miramar Pkwy., and there will be a preliminary pageant at noon at the Miramar Civic Center, 6920 SW 35th St.<P>

   Miramar Days -- a two-week celebration of Miramar's 41st birthday -- ends May 18 with a grand finale fireworks display at Lakeshore Park. These events are free and open to the public. For more information, call 962-5501.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

<B>A NEW NAME:</B> Broward School Board members are scheduled to vote Tuesday on a name for High School EEE, opening in the fall in Pembroke Pines.<P>

   Board members will be presented with a name favored by a committee of EEE parents and students in a vote last month: Everglades High. The School Board also will consider the recommended nickname Falcons.<P>

   Other names considered for EEE were Charles W. Flanagan and Pines.<P>

   At Tuesday's meeting, School Board members also will consider policy-waiver requests submitted by individual schools. The list includes a waiver requested by Ely High School that would study a proposal for a four-day school week with an optional fifth day for enrichment.<P>

   The School Board will meet at 1 p.m. at 600 SE Third Ave., Fort Lauderdale.<BR>
<P>

<B>GETTING ON BOARD:</B> The Pembroke Pines City Commission will have a special meeting to appoint members to the city's 12 advisory boards at 7 p.m. Wednesday at City Hall, 10100 Pines Blvd. <P>

   The commission also will have a closed meeting to discuss the Jeff Nelson lawsuit. Last week, a jury awarded $282,500 to Nelson, former manager of the Pembroke Lakes Golf Club. Nelson said the city fired him and denied him the right to appeal the dismissal. The city says Nelson resigned. The commission will decide whether to appeal the jury's decision.<P>

<B>MORE HOMES?</B>: The Planning and Zoning Board will meet at 7:30 p.m. Thursday at the Pines Conference Center, 10211 Taft St., to discuss rezoning 24 acres of the mall site at the northeast corner of Pines Boulevard and Dykes Road from commercial to residential.<P>

   Minto Builders, the developer of Towngate, proposes to build 72 single-family homes on the northeastern section of the lot.<P>

   Also under consideration: a proposal to put up a 75-foot cellular tower west of 142nd Avenue north of Sheridan Street.<BR>
<P>

<B>HEALTH CARE:</B> Tamarac Mayor Norm Abramowitz will discuss Medicare and Medicaid at the next meeting of the Coalition of Concerned Citizens of Pembroke Pines. The meeting will be at 7:30 tonight in Classroom Building 1 at Memorial Hospital Pembroke, 2261 N. University Dr., Pembroke Pines. Call 431-1801.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

<B>THUMBS UP OR THUMBS DOWN:</B> Teens will get the chance to be film critics this weekend.<P>

   The West Regional Library, 8601 W. Broward Blvd. in Plantation, will have a screening of several short films made specifically for young adults. The screening will be from 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday in the library's community room. Only those 12 to 18 will be admitted.<P>

   The films have been selected by the American Library Association as the best films for young adults, but the West Regional Library wants to know whether they are. The results of ballots cast by the viewers, as well as their reviews, will be sent to the national committee for feedback. Call 831-3318 for more information.<BR>
<P>

<B>NEW RULES:</B> The Plantation City Council will consider an ordinance Wednesday that would restrict auto repairs and maintenance and service to the interior of certain types of businesses, such as retail.<P>

   The issue came up with the Discount Auto Parts opening at Plantation Acres Plaza at Flamingo Road and Southwest Third Street. Customers will be able to have some basic work done on their cars, such as changing oil and other fluids, replacing windshield wipers and other basic maintenance and repairs. No major repair work will be done in the store.<P>

   Discount Auto Parts agreed to have the service area completely enclosed so as not to disturb residents in nearby neighborhoods, but the city decided to create an ordinance in case the council faces similar future situations.<P>

   The Council will meet at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall, 400 NW 73rd Ave.<BR>
<BR>
<P>

<B>HELPING OUT:</B> Anyone who goes to see the new movie Twister this weekend at Sawgrass Mills mall in Sunrise can volunteer to help in case one hits South Florida.<P>

   The American Red Cross and Cobb Movie Theater have teamed up to give everyone who buys a ticket information titled ``Are You Ready for a Tornado?''<P>

   The Red Cross also will be on hand with other information and to recruit volunteers to help during a disaster. Hurricane season is less than a month away, officials said.
