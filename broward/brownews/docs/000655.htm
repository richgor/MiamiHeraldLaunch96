  Hours before Denovan Johnson allegedly stabbed his mother to death with a kitchen knife, the 16-year-old punched his older brother in the face and threatened to kill the family in their sleep, his brother said Saturday.<P>

   But no one thought Denovan would follow through on his threat, Michael Johnson said, sitting in the tiny one-bedroom duplex he shared with his parents and brother.<P>

   ``My father said not to worry, that he was just talking and wasn't going to do anything,'' said Michael, 18.<P>

   Denovan -- who had been in state care for two years -- returned home in February after running away from a local facility, said Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services spokeswoman Lynette Beal.<P>

   The first day Denovan stepped inside the east Hollywood duplex, trouble started again.<P>

   His parents, Elaine and Henry Johnson, had trouble rearing Denovan, who often was physically abusive. As Denovan grew older, bigger and angrier, problems escalated. <P>

   In 1994, HRS took custody of the teen. Denovan was sent to out-of-state facilities: first in Ohio, then Georgia, then Texas.<P>

   At the Dartmouth Behavioral Mental Health Center in Dayton, Ohio, Denovan set a fire, Michael said. From there he was taken to a facility in Georgia and then to High Frontier Home in Texas. The ranch-type home near Fort Davis treats youths with intense psychological problems.<P>

   His mother wanted Denovan placed in a similar facility where the family could visit.<P>

   ``He needed family contact,'' Michael said. ``I spent about two years without seeing him. He'd send letters about how tall he had grown and about wanting to play basketball with me.''<P>

   Later, Denovan was transferred a less restrictive facility called the Dan Marino Home for Boys in Pompano Beach. There, he went to school in the morning and worked at Burger King.<P>

   In February, Denovan ran away and knocked on his parents' front door. They called HRS and told the agency Denovan was home. Weeks later, social workers asked a judge to let him live at home, although he was still under custody of the state, Beal said.<P>

   Social workers were supposed to provide counseling for the family but the teen didn't want it, Michael said. <P>

   Instead, Denovan spent his days asking for money to gamble at a horse track.<P>

   His mother -- who quit her job at a Winn-Dixie because she couldn't handle the family problems -- gave him $500. His brother, who has part-time jobs at Alamo Rent A Car and Winn-Dixie, gave him $200.<P>

   He wanted more. Denovan would wait for the mail and snatch his father's Social Security check, Michael said. His parents got a post office box.<P>

   Thursday, Denovan punched his brother in the face because Michael wouldn't give him money, then threatened to stab the family, Michael said. Michael went off to work. Denovan hopped on a bus.<P>

   Later, Denovan returned home and argued with his mother, police said, then fatally stabbed her with a steak knife. He was charged with murder and is being held in a detention facility.<P>

   ``Now, I'm scared he's going to get out and kill me or my father,'' Michael said. ``He told my father that when he gets out of jail he'll come back and kill us.''
