<m0>   The best friend of a man who was shot to death outside a record store showed up in tears at the Broward County Public Safety Complex on Sunday and told investigators the shooting was an accident.<ep>
   The friend, Omar Wilson, 21, of 565 NW 29th Ave., told police he and Oneil Roy Clarke were joking around with a 9mm semiautomatic weapon at the store just west of Fort Lauderdale when it discharged, striking Clarke in the back.<ep>
   Wilson told family members he was going to turn himself in, said his sister Evette Wilson.<ep>
   ``I asked him why, and he said he accidentally shot Oneil,'' she said. ``It's just hard to believe because Oneil was one of his best friends. They knew each other for six years. Oneil sleeps here, he eats here. They wear the same clothes.<ep>
   ``I couldn't believe it. They were good, good friends.''<ep>
  The shooting occurred just before 9:30 p.m. Saturday when Clarke, 23, of Fort Lauderdale, was visiting friends at Wingate Records, 1267 NW 31st Ave.<ep>
   Wilson said he and Clarke were joking around. During the horseplay, Clarke patted Wilson down, searching for a gun, investigators said.<ep>
   When he felt the piece at Wilson's side, Clarke feigned fright and turned away. Wilson then took the gun from his waistband and pointed it at Clarke, thinking it was unloaded, police said.<ep>
   Wilson told investigators he was stunned when a shot exploded into Clarke's back. He called 911 immediately.<ep>
   Minutes later, detectives James Carr and Eli Thomasevich arrived to find Clarke on his back, fatally wounded. No one was in the record store when the detectives entered, police said.<ep>
   Clarke was taken to Broward General Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, where he was pronounced dead at 10:52 p.m.<ep>
   Witnesses told detectives they heard the gunshot and turned in time to see Clarke collapse on the sidewalk in front of the store, but gave conflicting reports on how the shooting occurred.<ep>
   When Wilson turned himself in Sunday, he brought the gun with him.<ep>
   He was arrested and taken to the Broward County Jail without bond. Investigators said the shooting appeared unintentional, and they had no reason to doubt Wilson's story.<ql>
