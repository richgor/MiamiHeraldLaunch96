<m0>  From bicycles and Roller Blades and shouldertops, a wall-to-wall mass of people gave a collective cheer Saturday as the first formation flew over the 1996 Shell Air & Sea Show. Then came a collective laugh.<ep>
   A flock of pelicans in the flight path.<ep>
   But there was plenty more to come, from the roar of the strafing F-16 at full throttle, to the plume of red smoke left by a gently falling U.S. Army Golden Knights parachutist.<ep>
    Judging from the crowds, the sighs and the cheers, the first day of the two-day event was a success, despite the 2 1/2-mile walk some had to endure from as far away as Holiday Park, the waits for the portable toilets, a few minor skirmishes with sprained wrists and heat stroke, one stabbing, and the blistering heat.<ep>
   ``Shade! We've got shade over here,'' yelled Richard Haggerty, 52, of an embroidery equipment salesman from Plantation. ``Get over here. We've got shade!''<ep>
   It was by far the hottest commodity of the day, along with the beach showers (--) with a crowd of bikini-clad bodies 15 deep.<ep>
   ``It's so hot, we came to cool off so we could go back and enjoy the show,'' said Barb Gervase of Coral Springs, in line with her two kids. ``I've never been down here before with this many people.''<ep>
   Bicycles were another hot item, with hundreds of them locked and lined up against the beachfront fences.<ep>
   A dejected Matt Moritz, manager of International Bicycle and Skate Shop on Sunrise Boulevard, watched helplessly as throngs of potential customers came and went without flashing a cent.<ep>
   ``Two weeks ago, State Farm told me I can't rent bikes anymore,'' he said, standing outside on the crowded sidewalk, arms folded. ``Last year, I was sold out of rentals by noon. Oh well, there's still a lot of flat tires and repairs.''<ep>
   While the airplane pilots were attracting applause on the beach, pilots of in-line skates were attracting paramedics' attention a few hundred yards away.<ep>
   One entirely unexpected twist were roller-skaters attempting in vain to cross the grated Intracoastal Waterway drawbridge at Sunrise Boulevard.<ep>
   ``I'm OK now,'' said one embarrassed young female skater, flashing a bandaged wrist to a volunteer cop. ``Thanks for the help!'' she said, before disappearing into the crowd.<ep>
    A laughing <m1> <m0>Sofie Wiman, 24, of Weston, got about five feet onto the bridge before stopping short and making the precarious few steps back.<ep>
   ``I didn't know there was a real sidewalk right there or I would have been there from the start,'' she said. ``Ouch.''<ep>
    ``Yeah, we didn't expect that, but we've had several people falling on the bridge,'' said Pompano Beach police officer John Gill, who volunteered on bike patrol. ``There were a couple cases of heat stroke, falls and stuff, nothing major yet.''<ep>
   The beach was a huge wall of people, with no room to spare. And in places, tensions ran high. Paramedics even took one beach stabbing victim to Broward General Medical Center.<ep>
    ``There was one robbery, but this crowd makes it tough on us,'' Gill said. ``They described three guys, one with long hair and a ponytail and another with a bandanna. What good does that do us in this mess?''<ep>
   Jerry Pucillo and friends couldn't find a seat better than a piece of the pavement on Sunrise near the corner of State Road A1A. ``We thought we'd get on the beach in the sand, but I guess we didn't get here early enough,'' said the 34-year-old body-shop employee from Pembroke Pines.<ep>
   ``But, hey, who said these were bad seats,'' he said, referring to a tattooed young woman in the throng, standing just ahead. ``Can't beat these seats at all.''<ep>
   Not far away, vendors were trying every tactic to make a sale.<ep>
   Brad Tompkins was selling cameras and film. ``Take a picture of the traffic jam,'' he barked. ``It's only $7.50.''<ep>
   The main attractions were the Blue Angels and the once top-secret B2 Stealth Bomber.<ep>
   ``Yeah, that's what I came for,'' said Haggerty, of Plantation. ``To see what my tax dollars are going for and to check up on them and make sure they're not fooling around with it.''<ep>
   Seven-year-old Wayne Bernard of Margate cringed at the roar of a Fighting Falcon overhead.<ep>
   ``It hurts,'' he said, covering his ears and grinning. ``It's so loud I want to close my ears every time. . . . What I like about it is the airplanes look like the planes I have at home.''<ep>
   ``Cool!'' said Zach Roggin, 7, of Royal Palm Beach, as the Blue Angels did a unified 360-degree turn in the air.<ep>
   ``Awesome!'' chimed in Christopher Lowe, 10, sinking his feet into the sand.<ep>
   ``Holy cow! They're coming in upside down!'' Zach said.<ep>
   Kurt Gallegos had a unique perspective on the crowds (--) from the cockpit of an F-16.<ep>
   ``People were everywhere,`` said the U.S. Air Force pilot, who zipped over the crowd at 700 miles per hour. ``It had to be far more than a million.''<ql>
