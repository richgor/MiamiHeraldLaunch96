<m0>  Fort Lauderdale has the seventh-worst crime rate among major cities in the United States, according to a Herald analysis of FBI statistics for reported crimes in 1995.<ep>
   Miami ranks fifth, down from third the previous year.<ep>
   Hollywood, the only other city in Broward with at least 100,000 people, ranked 76th in the nation.<ep>
   While Fort Lauderdale's rank is high, it's a big step below last year's perch: No. 1.<ep>
   ``I'm glad,'' said Mayor Jim Naugle. ``This is one list that I don't want to be No. 1 on. But we won't be happy until we're at the bottom of the list.''<ep>
   Tourism officials sometimes worry that publicity about high crime rates will hurt local business.<ep>
   ``We've slipped in the polls,'' said Nicki Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``Thank goodness.''<ep>
   Fort Lauderdale's lower ranking for 1995 was the result of two factors: less crime and more people.<ep>
   The rankings are based on a crime rate that compares the number of reported crimes to the size of the population. That crime rate can then be used to compare cities of different sizes.<ep>
   The Fort Lauderdale rate declined because almost 10 percent fewer crimes were reported in 1995 than during the previous year. Also, the U.S. Census Bureau added almost 13,000 people to the city's estimated population between 1993 and 1994. That jump of 8 percent lowered the city's crime rate even further.<ep>
   Using the federal population and crime counts, there were about 1.5 reported crimes for every 10 residents of Fort Lauderdale last year, down from more than 1.7 reported crimes in 1994.<ep>
   If the updated 1994 population estimate had been used last year, Fort Lauderdale never would have been ranked No. 1 in crime. With the bigger population estimate, Fort Lauderdale would have ranked only fifth in crime for 1994. Using the same population figure, the city ranks seventh in 1995.<ep>
   The high rankings haven't hindered tourism in the area, said Tim Brennan, president of the Broward County Hotel/Motel Association and general manager of the Clarion Hotel Hollywood Beach.<ep>
   ``A lot of the tourists will read whether it's one or two or whatever,'' he said, ``but just about all of the tourists who come here feel very secure, very comfortable.<ep>
   ``When you talk to the travel agents, it's not a booking issue. You never hear about Fort Lauderdale having a crime problem.''<ep>
   Brennan said the hotels and motels work closely with the police to promote safety.<ep>
   He noted that very few violent incidents involve tourists.<ep>
   The FBI statistics focus on four major violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault) and three major property crimes (burglary, larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft).<ep>
   Fort Lauderdale ranked much higher in the property crimes than in violent crimes. The highest ranking for a violent crime is 33rd in robbery. The city ranks 74th and 79th in rape and assault.<ep>
   In murder, which is considered a particularly reliable indicator because virtually every murder is reported to police, the city ranks 61st in the nation.<ep>
   In property crimes, however, Fort Lauderdale ranks third in the nation in larceny and fourth in burglary. It ranks 22nd in auto theft.<ep>
   Hollywood has lower rankings in all categories. Its highest ranking is 38th in larceny.<ep>
   The crime rates are altered by many factors, such as whether crimes are reported to police. They are also affected by tourism. While tourists in an area can commit crimes and be victims of crimes, they are not counted in the population for estimating crime rates (--) so the number of crimes is spread over a smaller number of people. Also, many of the high-crime cities and states are in the South, where there is less of a seasonal decline in crimes during winter months.<ep>
   Finally, some cities do not report all crimes in accordance with the FBI program, so there are not complete figures for such cities as Chicago and Hialeah.<ep>
   Grossman said she thought the decrease came from greater police visibility. She said the Broward Sheriff's Office told her that the number of reported crimes in tourist areas has declined by 45 percent.<ep>
   ``I think it's because of increased visibility of law enforcement in this community,'' she said. ``The most important thing is that we're seeing a reduced number of crimes.''<ep>
   Naugle said he thought community-oriented anti-crime efforts helped reduce the crime rate.<ep>
   ``We're getting a lot of help from the neighborhoods,'' he said.<ql>
