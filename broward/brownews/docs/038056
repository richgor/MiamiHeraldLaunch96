   Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue had one of its busiest Sundays in recent memory, putting out minor fires across the city. No one was injured.<ep>
   ``Last night was a full moon,'' Division Chief Stephen R. McInerny said Sunday evening, after his department had fielded 95 alarms in less than 10 hours. Usually, the department has fewer than 100 alarms in 12 hours, and McInerny believed that would easily be surpassed.<ep>
   All the alarms were minor. Trash fires. Stove fires. A gas leak. There were no injuries, he said.<ep>
   Anytime we get a full moon on the weekends, we can count on it being extraordinarily busy,'' McInerny said. ``We accept that.''<ep>
