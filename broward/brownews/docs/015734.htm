   Michael J. Peter rose to riches his own way, mixing pricey liquor, naked women and business savvy. For 20 years, his strip clubs have sprung up in South Florida and beyond, luring customers with upscale entertainment.<P>

   For 20 years, the law has shadowed him. Always, he walked away unscathed, and gained a ``reputation of invincibility,'' says a U.S. Department of Justice memo titled Operation Naked Dollars.<P>

   Maybe no more.<P>

   In West Palm Beach federal court Friday, Peter sat in the defendant's chair as his attorney Roy Black and the U.S. attorney's office announced they had come to terms on a plea agreement.<P>

   The deal, cut one month before Peter was to stand trial on a 10-count indictment, would have him plead guilty to one racketeering charge, serve a two-year prison term, pay a $25,000 fine and give up his liquor licenses and strip clubs. The government would drop the remaining charges.<P>

   There's an unusual twist: Peter, 48, wouldn't have to surrender to federal authorities until January. Meanwhile, he'd be freed from house arrest, be allowed to drink liquor and be permitted to travel to conduct his business affairs.<P>

   The reason: to allow Peter to sell off his assets, with the proceeds going to pay off a multimillion dollar civil court lawsuit hanging over his head.<P>

   ``He will need some time,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence LaVecchio told the judge Friday. ``And he can't do that from jail.''<P>

   Because Peter already spent five months behind bars awaiting trial, he'd likely serve less than a year and a half once in prison. Once out, he'd serve two years on supervised release.<P>

   It's not set in stone, however. U.S. District Judge Daniel T.K. Hurley, presented the proposed plea deal Friday, said he needs time before approving it. Hurley ordered a presentence investigation by the U.S. probation department.<P>

   The judge acknowledged being taken aback by the sudden turn of events in a case so brutally fought it fills several feet of court files.<P>

   ``I must admit you have all taken me by surprise,'' Hurley told the parties Friday morning. ``I thought we were pretty well geared up for a trial.''<P>

   Despite the steady shadow of law enforcement, Peter has risen to vast wealth -- and respect within his business. At his clubs, employees are known to rush to open doors for him. He drove around town in a white Rolls-Royce. He owned a talent agency.<P>

   Court papers say Peter claims to own or manage 50 adult entertainment clubs grossing $100 million a year. Among them: Solid Gold and Pure Platinum in Fort Lauderdale, Thee Dollhouse in Pompano Beach, Solid Gold and La Bare in North Miami Beach -- and clubs in Orlando, New York, Minneapolis, Providence, Myrtle Beach, Chicago and Honolulu.<P>

   If the case went to trial, Peter would face federal charges that essentially accuse him of two types of crimes:<P>

   <LI> One, that he allowed a convicted felon and organized crime figures to maintain hidden ownerships in his Broward strip clubs -- and paid those figures $500 a week cash under the table.<P>

   <LI> Two, that he repeatedly strong-armed competitors and colleagues. The indictment recounts five alleged instances of extortion -- with Peter threatening to have the fingers crushed of one man recruiting his dancers and threatening to expose ``secrets'' of another man he purportedly owes millions of dollars.<P>

   Along the way, Black's law office attacked the government's case at its core, calling references to mob figures ``highly prejudicial,'' and alleging the government initially searched Peter's businesses in Broward and Dade based on an affidavit filled with lies and half-truths.<P>

   Once, Black referred to the government's actions as ``psychological warfare.''<P>

   And Black -- one of Florida's best-known criminal defense lawyers recognized for his low-key courtroom charm -- has some high-powered ammunition of his own.<P>

   Ammunition that starts with questions about the way law enforcement went after Peter in the first place.<P>

   Two of the government's initial informants -- one even planted by agents as a Peter employee -- are now Peter turncoats who say they are willing to testify. For the defense.<P>

   ``It was anything to get MJP,'' said Warren Stang, 41, who was a paid informant and a government plant in the Peter organization as far back as 1991. ``They had nothing, and they were willing to pay me to come up with anything. The whole thing was bogus from the start.''<P>

   Stang contends agents lied on search warrant affidavits, citing evidence from Stang that never existed. He says agents orchestrated a campaign of misinformation designed to keep Peter paranoid, even faking a police report about a bomb being found in one of Peter's cars.<P>

   ``Their case is in the toilet and they know it,'' said Stang, of Fort Lauderdale, who for years has operated on the shady side of the law with a string of arrests ranging from shoplifting to money laundering to fraud.<P>

   Stang refers to Fort Lauderdale police detective Charles Funkey and Sgt. Pat Roberts with the Florida Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco. Both worked the Peter case as part of an investigative team including Broward's Metropolitan Organized Crime Intelligence Unit (MIU) and the FBI.<P>

   Both have declined interviews, but depositions and internal police records suggest a differing story, depicting Stang -- known as ``source 21'' within MIU -- as prone to ``fantasies,'' Funkey said.<P>

   ``He is a legend in his own mind perhaps,'' Funkey said of Stang.<P>

   Going into trial, the feds had other witnesses on their side, including several from within Peter's ``inner circle.'' Among them: James Williams, a convicted felon once described by Peter as his best friend. Williams purportedly maintained a hidden ownership in Thee Dollhouse III in Pompano Beach for years.<P>

   Going into trial, Peter had history on his side. In 1994, a jury in Broward circuit court took just minutes to acquit him of charges he extorted and kidnapped a business rival. The state case involved an extortion act charged in the federal case.
