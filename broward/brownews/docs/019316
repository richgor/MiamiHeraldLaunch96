<m0>   The Pembroke Pines City Commission appointed almost 80 people to its 12 advisory boards Wednesday.<ep>
   Each member will serve four years. Most boards meet monthly.<ep>
   The commission named members to the following boards: Planning and Zoning, Board of Adjustment, Youth Activities Committee, Charter Review, Citizens Advisory Board, Code Enforcement, Consumer Affairs, Disciplinary Action, Economic Development, Landscaping, Unsafe Structures and Walter C. Young Resource Center.<ep>
   In other news, the City Commission had a closed meeting to discuss the Jeff Nelson lawsuit. Last week, a jury awarded $282,500 to Nelson, former manager of the Pembroke Lakes Golf Club. Nelson said the city fired him and denied him the right to appeal the dismissal. The commission voted to appeal the jury's decision.<ql>
