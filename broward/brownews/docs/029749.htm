   He's dined with President Clinton, befriended Governor Chiles, served as political point man for one of America's most well-oiled Democratic machines.<P>

   But Monday, Russell Barakat sat in stunned silence in Fort Lauderdale Federal Court, the joy drained from his face, the prospect of prison looming around the bend.<P>

   The news came swiftly, after a federal jury deliberated less than two hours and found Barakat, Broward's Democratic Party Chairman, guilty of filing a false tax return. In nearly the same breath, they acquitted him of mail fraud conspiracy.<P>

   Technically, it's a split verdict.<P>

   Practically, it's a sign his days probably are numbered as chairman of the Broward Democratic Party, which helped Clinton into the White House with the largest cushion of any county in the South. Also in jeopardy: his 24-year career as executive director of the Broward County Housing Authority.<P>

   At first, when jurors declared not guilty on mail fraud, Barakat let out a gasp, his head nodding in momentary triumph. Then came the second verdict: guilty.<P>

   Afterward, Barakat, 56, professed innocence -- and vowed to continue on in circles political and public.<P>

   ``I know that I have never cheated the government out of a penny,'' he said in a statement to The Herald. ``I have instructed my attorneys to pursue any and all legal avenues to correct this verdict.''<P>

   As for his future plans: ``It is my fervent hope that the Housing Authority, as well as the Democrats of Broward County, will allow me to continue to serve them.''<P>

   Still, he admitted, ``It is difficult today to predict what will happen in my public and professional life. Obviously, my wife and I will need some time to decide how to proceed.''<P>

   First, Barakat must fight to stay out of prison. Sentencing is Aug. 5 before Chief U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger, and Barakat is likely to face probation to over a year behind bars.<BR>
A government victory<P>

   For the federal government, Monday's verdict marks a major victory in its seven-year quest to crack alleged political corruption in Broward -- investigations combining the efforts of the U.S. Attorney's Office, FBI, IRS, Department of Labor and Metropolitan Intelligence Unit.<P>

   Barakat is the fifth person to stand trial as part of the probes, and the third convicted.<P>

   During trial, prosecutors Debra Herzog and James Hopkins hit home on Barakat's positions of prominence.<P>

   ``This is a man who has a lot of friends, who has a lot of power, who has a lot of influence,'' Herzog said Monday, standing in a courtroom filled with Barakat supporters. ``But the rules apply to him, too.''<P>

   In the end, jurors decided Barakat broke the rules when he failed to disclose on his 1989 tax return $9,666 he pocketed from a Tennessee housing firm. But they acquitted him of mail fraud conspiracy, which carries a prison term of up to five years.<P>

   For jurors, the verdicts were clear on both counts.<P>

   ``We went by the evidence,'' foreman Lee Montgomery said. ``There it was in black and white.''<BR>
The crucial evidence<P>

   The evidence: $15,000 in checks originating from the Tennessee housing firm, going through now-convicted felon Eli Louis Fields' law office account and landing in Barakat's bank account. Fields kept just over one-third, and Barakat the rest, nearly $10,000.<P>

   The government said it was illegal -- that Barakat was not permitted to profit from companies doing business with his Broward housing agencies like the Tennessee firm. Besides his Housing Authority role, Barakat once chaired a county housing finance board.<P>

   Barakat said it was legitimate -- that he was paid for consulting work in San Antonio and Los Angeles.<P>

   In a sense, jurors split the difference. They didn't rule Barakat broke the law by pocketing the money, but that he did by not reporting it on his tax return. Montgomery and fellow juror John Washburn said Barakat was solely to blame for his conviction. ``He did it himself,'' Montgomery said.<BR>
The middleman<P>

   During trial, defense lawyer Edward Kay attacked the middleman in the money matter, Fields. A central figure in the Broward corruption probes, Fields got a six-year prison term for tax fraud and racketeering in unrelated cases, but walked free less than halfway through by cooperating against Barakat.<P>

   Still, prosecutors didn't put Fields on the stand, deciding his rap sheet and record of lying in court could cripple their case.<P>

   Kay pounced on Fields' absence. <P>

   ``There is a jigsaw puzzle here, but the green slime of Eli Fields is missing,'' Kay bellowed, griping that his client didn't even get to confront his accuser.<P>

   In opening remarks, Kay said Barakat recently filed an amended tax return, that the first was merely a ``mistake.'' During trial, he paraded prominent character witnesses before jurors, including U.S. Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. and Broward Judge William Lance Andrews.<P>

   ``In my head and in my heart, I think my client is not guilty,'' Kay said, vowing an appeal. ``We feel down right now, but we'll be back up again.''
