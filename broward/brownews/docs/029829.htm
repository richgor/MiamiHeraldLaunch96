   Saying it is time to play hardball with Lennar Homes, residents of Hampshire Homes decided Thursday that the developer must buy out all 20 homes on the site's sinkhole and do soil tests of all 307 homes.<P>

   Lennar also must install new siding on all homes in the Miramar development, resod all lawns and set up an escrow account to repay homeowners who cannot sell their homes at fair market value. Homeowners complain that the siding on their homes is deteriorating.<P>

   Dozens of residents agreed at Thursday's homeowners meeting to back a plan by Andre Melton, homeowners' association president, to reject Lennar's latest proposal and offer his own instead.<P>

   Melton will meet with Lennar Thursday to discuss the proposal, and will deliver Lennar's answer to homeowners at another meeting Thursday night.<P>

   If Lennar does not agree to these conditions, ``we will go to the next level,'' said Melton. ``Lennar is a rich company with a lot of friends and we have to get a lot of friends, too. It's time to play hardball.''<P>

   Melton would not elaborate.<P>

   It appeared that an agreement had been reached Tuesday, when Lennar agreed to test for debris at all 307 homes. But Melton and homeowners objected to Lennar's condition that homeowners must first request the testing in writing.<P>

   ``Then they could say, `Well, you didn't submit the request by so and so day so we can't come out this month,' '' Melton said. ``There were loopholes.''<P>

   Homeowners had a lot of questions for Melton Thursday -- and a few opinions of their own. Some felt the association should go further -- take out newspaper ads in towns where Lennar is building saying, ``Is Your Development Built Over Garbage -- Don't Trust Lennar'' and picket locally. Others talked about a class-action lawsuit, while others worried that attorneys would take 30 percent.<P>

   ``You're coming to a giant on your knees,'' said homeowner Marcus Ramirez. ``We're dealing with a Goliath.''<P>

   Another homeowner questioned whether the association had reported Lennar to the Department of Professional Regulation in Tallahassee.<P>

   ``We're getting the short end of the stick,'' said Oniel McCalla, who lives on the sinkhole. ``We told them what we want and they laughed at us and told us what they would do.''<P>

   But Melton told homeowners: ``It's not like I don't know who I'm dealing with and what I'm dealing with.<P>

   ``If you all don't stick with me, I don't have a chance,'' he said. ``I'm trying to make the best deal not for me, not for the 20 residents of the sinkhole, but for all 307 homes. I'm not stalling.''<P>

   Melton also told residents engineers could test a block a day and it would take about two months to complete testing. He assured them he or association management would videotape the process.<P>

   What if debris is found under homes, homeowners asked. Lennar would have to buy the homes, Melton said.<P>

   Melton also encouraged homeowners to attend Wednesday's City Commission meeting and a county Department of Natural Resource Protection hearing scheduled for May 17. Lennar has been cited by the agency and could face fines at the hearing.<P>

   About 250 truckloads of tires and debris were excavated from a common backyard area behind 20 homes in March after sinkholes developed. Since then, residents have had to live with a football-field-size pit in their back yards that has become filled with brown, murky water, mosquitoes and giant frogs.<P>

   Fearing Lennar would flee the area once the pit is filled, residents have refused to allow Lennar to fill it in until they have a signed agreement for testing.
