  Tony Rode and Angel de la Rosa say many of the charges levied against them by Hollywood police investigators are unfair and riddled with inaccuracies.<P>

   They were each accused of multiple violations of state law, plus between 80 and 115 violations of police procedures.<P>

   Here are some of the charges and Rode's responses:<P>

   <LI> Failing to include copies of college transcripts in the personnel files of candidates.<P>

   Rode's response: In some cases where transcripts were allegedly missing, the applicant never attended college.<P>

   <LI> Failing to conduct checks of driving histories in all states where candidates lived.<P>

   Rode's response: In some cases where the records were allegedly missing, the candidate never lived in the state permanently. They were only there temporarily on military assignment or for short-term training and never got new licenses.<P>

   <LI> Failing to conduct new background checks on candidates already working for the department as corrections officers.<P>

   Rode's response: Department policy allowed investigators to update the file, instead of starting from scratch.<P>

   <LI> Failing to contact the neighbors of an applicant who lived in Homestead before Hurricane Andrew.<P>

   Rode's response: Investigators tried, but the people had left because their houses were wiped out. Instead, they checked with Homestead police.<P>

   <LI> Failing to include copies of background records in the applicant's file, such as criminal histories or driver's license checks.<P>

   Rode's response: In some cases the information was there, but in a different form that wasn't recognized by the person reviewing the files.<P>

   <LI> Violating procedures in connection with the hiring of officers whose applications and paperwork he did not review or approve.<P>

   Rode's response: At the time they were hired, he was either on vacation or away at training seminars.<P>

   <LI> Failing to properly review polygraph examinations given to candidates.<P>

   Rode's response: Half were screened and hired before he took over supervision of the personnel unit on July 8, 1991.
