<m0>  Wilton Manors police are investigating the mysterious death of an 8-year-old boy Friday.<ep>
   ``It was a totally unexpected death,'' said Wilton Manors detective David Jones.<ep>
   Police and rescue workers were called to a home in the 500 block of Northeast 20th Street about 5:20 p.m. in reference to a sick child who wasn't breathing, Jones said.<ep>
   Rescue workers found the boy unresponsive and rushed him to the hospital. He died at 6:22 p.m. in the emergency room of Broward General Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale.<ep>
   Investigators don't suspect foul play. The boy was injured in a playground accident on Thursday, but investigators don't know whether that had any bearing on his death. They are waiting for the results of an autopsy to determine whether the boy suffered from any undetected medical problems.<ql>
