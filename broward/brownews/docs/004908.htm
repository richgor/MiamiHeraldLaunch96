    After initially reaching an impasse Friday, jurors in the third corruption trial of Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez went back to work and late in the day indicated they are close to ruling on some extortion and racketeering charges but are stuck on others.<P>

   They then recessed until 9 a.m. Monday -- leaving the hope there will be some closure to the 6-year-old case.<P>

   Earlier in the day, the latest Martinez prosecution seemed destined to end in another frustrating mistrial.<P>

   Problems first surfaced about 10 a.m. when juror Tanya Caridad Bracken sent a note to Senior U.S. Judge James Kehoe, saying she could not deliberate further. But, barring health problems, Kehoe refused to dismiss her.<P>

   Four hours later, jury foreman James Derrickson sent Kehoe another discouraging note: ``Judge Kehoe, we are hopelessly at odds, and I don't think we will ever be in agreement on any of the counts.''<P>

   Martinez grimaced, arms crossed, as he shook his head. Martinez family members whispered incredulously. One said, ``Oh my God, this is amazing.''<P>

   Jury impasses are nothing new in the Martinez case.<P>

   After the first trial in 1991, one juror said she had wanted to acquit Martinez but felt pressured to join the other 11 in convicting him on four counts of extortion and two counts of racketeering. Appellate judges ordered a new trial in 1994, citing flawed jury instructions and blatant jury misconduct.<P>

   At the second trial, which ended March 26, jurors told Kehoe after two days of deliberation that they had reached an impasse. Kehoe ordered them to deliberate more, but they remained deadlocked because one juror held out for conviction.<P>

   Friday afternoon, Kehoe told the third jury to try once more.<P>

   Kehoe told jurors to ask themselves whether they had a substantive reason for holding onto their opinion -- guilty or innocent. And he reiterated how important it is for them to settle the case once and for all.<P>

   ``The trial has been expensive in time, money and emotional strain on both the defendant and the prosecution,'' Kehoe said. He had no reason to believe the case could be tried any better a fourth time, or that a better jury could be selected, he said.<P>

    Martinez is charged with trading favorable zoning to developers for money and land deals that brought him profits between $134,000 and $182,000.<P>

   While jurors resumed deliberations, about 15 Martinez supporters prayed aloud for acquittal in the pews of the courthouse.<P>

   Two hours later, jurors sent another note to Kehoe, saying they had made some progress but were ready to quit for the day. They also asked Kehoe whether they could rule on some counts but not on others -- to which the judge answered yes.<P>

   Defense attorney Jose Qui&ntilde;on asked the judge to declare a mistrial.<P>

   Qui&ntilde;on, who had asked jurors for an ``all-or-nothing'' ruling during closing arguments, argued that jurors should not deliberate further because they may feel pressured to compromise. <P>

   Kehoe denied the request.
