<m0>   <m0>NEW RULES: <m0>The Plantation City Council will consider an ordinance <m0>Wednesday <m0>that would restrict auto repairs and maintenance and service to the interior of certain types of businesses, such as retail.<ep>
   The issue came up with the Discount Auto Parts opening at Plantation Acres Plaza at Flamingo Road and Southwest Third Street. Customers will be able to have some basic work done on their cars, such as changing oil and other fluids, replacing windshield wipers and other basic maintenance and repairs. No major repair work will be done in the store.<ep>
   Discount Auto Parts agreed to have the service area completely enclosed so as not to disturb residents in nearby neighborhoods, but the city decided to create an ordinance in case the council faces similar future situations.<ep>
   The Council will meet at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall, 400 NW 73rd Ave.<ql>
