<m0>   A small pipe that was thought to be a bomb shut down eight blocks of downtown Hollywood near 21st Avenue and Tyler Street early Monday after a store owner found the device in his mailbox and threw it into the street.<ep>
   The Broward Sheriff's Office Bomb and Arson Squad retrieved the device and determined it was a fake. Hollywood police are investigating, but have no suspects.<ep>
   ``The investigation is in the very early stages,'' said Todd DeAngelis, a Hollywood police spokesman.<ep>
      Harold Sokoloff, owner of Quality Restaurant and Bar Equipment, 117 N. 21st Ave., arrived at work about 9:20 a.m. and found an open manila envelope in the small black mailbox beside the front door. He saw a pipe inside it.<ep>
   ``It appeared to be a pipe bomb,'' said Sokoloff, 39. ``I've seen them before. I threw it out of my hands and on the road. I was scared. Wouldn't you be?''<ep>
   Sokoloff and his fiancee, Becky Wayne, opened the store three months ago. It specializes in constructing and outfitting restaurants with cooking equipment.<ep>
   The bomb squad's efforts forced traffic to be rerouted around Hollywood Boulevard for about an hour, though it caused no major traffic snarls.<ep>
   Nor did it fluster Hollywood resident Kathy McCartney, 38. She was walking through downtown when police arrived on the scene.<ep>
   ``It's not so surprising. It was only a matter of time till it came over here to Hollywood. What's next?'' said McCartney, who lives nearby.<ep>
   David Lee, 27, a worker at Murphy Beds and Custom Furniture, 2033 Hollywood Blvd., watched as the pipe was removed.<ep>
   ``It's normal in Florida. It didn't faze me,'' he said.<ql>
