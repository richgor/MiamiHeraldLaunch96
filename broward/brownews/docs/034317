<m0>   For three Broward politicians, Saturday marked the end of more than just another legislative session. It marked the end of their careers.<ep>
   Sens. Peter Weinstein and Robert Wexler and Rep. Ben Graber won't be going back to the Capitol. All three will quit the Legislature to run for the same congressional seat this fall, and by next spring, three different people will occupy their seats representing north and west Broward.<ep>
   In the frantic rush toward adjournment, lawmakers paused to say goodbye to the three Democrats who have a combined total of 28 years in the Legislature.<ep>
   As House Health Care Committee chairman for the past four years, Graber, a doctor, has been a major figure in every battle over medicine, showing the dispassionate manner of a doctor making his rounds.<ep>
   But he got a standing ovation after an emotional speech in which he praised the Legislature's diversity and emphasized the need for teamwork in the political process, saying eight years in the House taught him important lessons about life. ``If you don't work as a team (--) if you're by yourself (--) you don't accomplish anything,'' Graber said.<ep>
   In the clubbier Senate, Weinstein and Wexler traded one-liners. When Sen. Fred Dudley (--) an irascible Republican from Cape Coral who once clashed with a rabbi over school prayer (--) called Weinstein a senator with ``a heart of gold and a head of steel,'' Wexler couldn't resist.<ep>
  ``Gee, if Sen. Dudley would make his endorsement of Sen. Weinstein official, that would be terrific,'' Wexler joked.<ql>
