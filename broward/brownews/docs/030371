<m0>   A 1-year-old Hollywood boy nearly drowned Tuesday after falling into his grandmother's pool in Pembroke Pines, police said.<ep>
   Diya Farraj of Hollywood was in stable condition at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood. Diya fell into the pool behind his grandmother's home at 8980 NW Seventh Ct., said Pembroke Pines spokeswoman Maryann Flanagan.<ep>
   Investigators didn't know how the boy wandered into the pool, because furniture was blocking the door that leads from the home's interior to the screened-in pool, Flanagan said.<ep>
   A number of other children were at the home about 8 p.m. when Diya fell in, she said.<ep>
   Diya was found by his 7-year-old aunt, who pulled him from the pool. She handed him to the grandmother, Nada Abusab, who ran to the front yard as someone called police, Flanagan said. Rescue arrived and took the boy to the hospital, she said.<ql>
