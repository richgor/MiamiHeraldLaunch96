<m0>  Tony Rode and Angel de la Rosa had promising careers with the Hollywood Police Department.<ep>
   Their personnel files were filled with commendations. Rode ranked at the top of the list for promotion to lieutenant.<ep>
   That all fell apart on Dec. 1, when their names became linked with the words ``scandal'' and ``corruption'' (--) harsh words that often leave a permanent stain on a police officer's credibility and can be the kiss of death for a career.<ep>
   Rode and de la Rosa refuse to accept the city's punishment.<ep>
   Rode, who was de la Rosa's supervisor, is speaking out publicly for the first time about the events of the last five months that led to the two officers being disciplined.<ep>
   They admit they made mistakes in their rush to meet affirmative action guidelines and get officers into the police academy quickly. But the mistakes, they say, were honest ones, done without malice or any kind of premeditated plan to control who wears the Hollywood badge.<ep>
   ``If you read the newspapers, you thought I was Charles Manson,'' said Rode, 37, who was a sergeant with 17 years as a Hollywood officer before the investigation.<ep>
   Rode and de la Rosa became the targets of a city investigation into questionable hiring practices, along with former Deputy Chief Gilbert Frazier and officer Philip Tortorici. Their names were splashed in the media, day after day, culminating in their firings in February.<ep>
   Initially, they were baffled at the swirl of events. They didn't understand what they had done wrong. When others spoke out, they held back, following a department rule that prohibits discussing an ongoing investigation.<ep>
   Instead, they watched as the publicity surrounding the investigation unfolded, ultimately growing so big it took on a life of its own (--) and threatened to destroy their careers.<ep>
   Although City Manager Sam Finz overturned former Chief Richard Witt's decision to fire Rode and de la Rosa, they still feel the punishment he meted out is too harsh.<ep>
   Rode went back to work in March after a 116-day unpaid suspension. But he took a $10,000 pay cut and lost his sergeant's stripes in the process. He'll get them back in February.<ep>
   Now on road patrol, Rode cannot be considered for promotion to lieutenant until February 1998.<ep>
   De la Rosa, 37, is still serving a six-month, unpaid suspension that began Feb. 9. He also will be ineligible for promotion until 1998.<ep>
   Finz, who stands firm on his disciplinary action, refused any attempts to negotiate a compromise.<ep>
   ``I have no intention of modifying my decision,'' said Finz, who spent more than 60 hours reviewing the charges against both officers. ``My job is over. I did my review, and I came out with discipline that I thought was appropriate.''<ep>
   But Rode and de la Rosa feel they are being unfairly singled out, considering they were not the only ones to approve the hiring of officers with questionable backgrounds.<ep>
   De la Rosa, a 16-year police veteran, decided last week to follow the course Rode already had chosen and present his case to an arbitrator.<ep>
   Once an arbitrator makes a decision, the city and officers must accept it. No hearings have been scheduled.<m1><ql>
<m1>Caught in cross-fire<m1><ep>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   Rode and de la Rosa say they feel they got caught in a political fight between former Chief Witt and Deputy Chief Frazier.<ep>
   They say Witt tried to get them both to give statements against Frazier, in exchange for having the charges against them dropped.<ep>
   ``Witt saw the opportunity to sink Frazier and, as a result, other people went down in the boat,'' Rode said. ``It hurts.''<ep>
   Witt denies the accusations.<ep>
   ``I have no political ax to grind with Gil Frazier, not now, not then and not in the future,'' Witt said Friday. ``That's manufactured to satisfy someone else's position.''<ep>
   Ultimately, nobody won.<ep>
   Witt was fired.<ep>
   Frazier was forced to retire.<ep>
   Rather than face discipline, Tortorici also retired.<ep>
   And three of the officers identified as questionable hires also lost their jobs.<ql>
<m1>Morale plunges<m1><ep>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   The department itself also has suffered (--) from negative publicity and divisiveness within the force. Morale sank to an all-time low and the public lost confidence in its officers, calling for city leaders to fix the problem.<ep>
   Rode says he could have understood the charges against him if someone showed him a motive.<ep>
   ``Where is the criminal intent?'' he asked. ``Where did I gain personally? You're not going to find that I have a condo in Hawaii or I took extravagant trips.''<ep>
   Neither the city's outside investigator nor reporters have found any evidence of a payoff or complicity.<ep>
   The Broward state attorney's office still is reviewing the case and has not decided whether to file criminal charges.<ep>
   Investigators found 40 out of 67 of the officers hired this decade had ``moderate to serious problems.'' They ranged from recruits lying on applications to candidates who were hired despite criminal pasts and poor driving records.<ep>
   ``Not one of these errors would have disqualified any of those people from being hired,'' Rode said.<ql>
<m1>Lots of questions<m1><ep>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   Were Rode and his detectives sloppy with paperwork?<ep>
   Were they under pressure to hire more minority officers?<ep>
   Did they overlook problems in the backgrounds of minority applicants?<ep>
   Did they take a closer look at candidates from law enforcement families?<ep>
   The answer to every one of those questions is yes.<ep>
   But, Rode says, consider the circumstances.<ep>
   Frazier told him the department had to increase the number of minority officers, he said.<ep>
   During the almost four years Rode served as head of personnel, 73 percent of the officers hired were minorities. Of the hires who have come into question during the investigation, 80 percent were minorities.<ep>
   Because of the pressures, de la Rosa, a polygrapher, was asked to pitch in as a background investigator, although he had no training in the field.<ep>
   Over the years, de la Rosa said he asked higher-ups many times to send him for proper training in background checks. His request was denied because of budget constraints.<ep>
   Now he is being charged with not conducting proper investigations.<ep>
   ``In [investigators'] rush to judgment, they made the same kind of mistakes that they accused my detectives of making,'' Rode said.<ql>
<m1>Some acknowledgement<m1><ep>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   Finz would not respond to specific questions about the charges or the explanations offered by Rode.<ep>
   But he acknowledged that he did find problems with some of the charges against Rode and de la Rosa and didn't feel the officers' actions warranted termination.<ep>
   ``I believe there were some problems with errors and omissions,'' Finz said. ``But there is still doubt in my mind about other allegations.''<ep>
   Ultimately, the final decision will rest with an arbitrator.<ep>
   Meanwhile, Rode and de la Rosa are struggling to pick up the pieces of their careers.<ep>
    ``I try to smile and be happy,'' Rode said. ``I got caught up in something I had minimal control over. Now I have to live with it. I'm not going to leave. I'm going to finish it here and try to regain my status.''<ql>
