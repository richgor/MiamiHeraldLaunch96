   Seven South Florida chiropractors were jailed Thursday as part of a sweeping statewide investigation into an alleged ambulance chasing and insurance fraud scheme authorities say has cost consumers millions of dollars over the past two years.<P>

   Warrants were issued against 13 chiropractors with businesses from Miami to Panama City. Eleven were arrested. Of the two still at large, one is from Dade.<P>

   Twenty others not charged, including a dozen from South Florida, remain under investigation.<P>

   ``Honestly, I doubt any of these guys will spend any time in jail,'' said Detective John Bukata, a Broward investigator with the Florida Insurance Commissioner's Office. ``What we hope is the public humiliation and the probation will throw the fear of God into them and anyone else out there.<P>

   ``This kind of thing is costing you and me millions.''<P>

   According to Bukata, who headed the two-year investigation, the chiropractors would pay a $300 to $500 ``referral fee'' for every prospective patient sent to them by a telemarketing firm called Prebeck Consulting Inc.<P>

   Prebeck Consulting would find the prospective patients by going through accident reports at local police stations, then calling those involved up to two weeks after the accident and offering them a free examination.<P>

   ``We're not suggesting that all these people were unhurt,'' said Joe Pappacoda, assistant statewide prosecutor on the case. ``We don't know. But if you were really hurt, wouldn't you seek medical attention on your own?''<P>

   Investigative records show that some of the chiropractors involved were paying Prebeck tens of thousands of dollars for hundreds of referrals, each of which was worth as much as $10,000 in insurance claims.<P>

   Each chiropractor arrested Thursday was charged with one felony count of unlawful insurance solicitation, booked into their local county jail, and posted the $1,000 bail within hours.<P>

   Those arrested in South Florida are:<P>

   <LI> Daniel Miles Barr, 35, of Barr Health Services in Fort Lauderdale, who paid Prebeck Consulting $19,750 in referral fees.<P>

   <LI> Allen Jay Britt, 47, of Britt Chiropractic Center in Deerfield Beach, who paid Prebeck Consulting $14,300 in referral fees.<P>

   <LI> Renny Mitchell Edelson, 34, of Chiro-Care Center in Plantation, who paid $8,500 in referral fees.<P>

   <LI> Jeffrey Scott Gordon, 35, of Pembroke Commons Chiro Center in Pembroke Pines, who paid $7,750 in referral fees.<P>

   <LI> Randolph Verno Hansborough, 41, of Stuart Health Associates in Stuart, who paid $3,710 in referral fees.<P>

   <LI> Kevin Marlin, 30, of Marlin Chiropractic Clinic in Miami, who paid $1,500 in referral fees.<P>

   <LI> William Michael Seufert, 38, of Hollywood, who paid $17,500 in referral fees.<P>

   Still being sought is Perry Scott Saul, 38, of Miami.<P>

   None of those arrested returned telephone calls or pages Thursday.<P>

   The complicated and far-reaching investigation of insurance fraud began with law enforcement perpetrating an elaborate fraud of its own.<P>

   Insurance investigators set up a phony accident. Bukata obtained a fake driver's license with a fake name and a fake Social Security number. He obtained a fake vehicle registration number from Nationwide Insurance and a fake insurance policy from Geico Insurance.<P>

   He persuaded Davie police to write up a fake accident report and got Ryder Truck Rental to agree to appear to be at fault.<P>

   So, at 10:50 a.m. Feb. 2, 1994, at the intersection of U.S. 441 and State Road 84, a runaway Ryder Truck hit Bukata's 1991 Ford -- or so says Davie police report No. 94-2-4972. The report was careful to point out that no one was injured.<P>

   ``At that point, all I had to do was wait for the phone call,'' at the phone number set up at the fake address, Bukata said.<P>

   Two weeks later, it came.<P>

   ``The guy called himself Andy Anderson, and he said he was from Broward Consumer Services,'' Bukata said. ``I kept telling him I wasn't hurt, that there was nothing wrong, but he persisted. He told me I should be checked out. He said it was free and that you never know what problems might flare up later.''<P>

   The caller set the appointment with Coral Springs Chiropractor Frank Darrow, records show.<P>

   ``Before I went in, I went to a legitimate physician for a clean bill of health,'' Bukata said. ``That same day, I went to Darrow, and I went in wired.<P>

   ``I told him there was nothing wrong with me. I wasn't injured,'' Bukata said. ``And he proceeded to lay out the program and why I should be treated anyway. It's all on tape.''<P>

   After six visits, Darrow, 47, who lives in Parkland, was charged with grand theft, unlawful insurance solicitation, and six counts of insurance fraud. Darrow, who is still in business in Coral Springs, agreed to cooperate, according to court records. The charges were dropped after Darrow completed community service. He led authorities to Prebeck Consulting Inc.<P>

   Glen and Susan Prebeck, formerly of Miami Beach and now in Warren, Mich., were charged with racketeering, two counts of conspiracy to racketeer, and 22 counts of unlawful insurance solicitation in the Darrow case, records show.<P>

   They each got five years probation in exchange for tattling on all the doctors to whom they sent patients -- 33 in all.<P>

   ``In one five-month period, the Prebecks deposited $450,000 from these doctors at $300 a pop,'' said Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson, who flew to Fort Lauderdale on Thursday to announce the arrests. ``And it's all the insurance consumers who are being ripped off.''
