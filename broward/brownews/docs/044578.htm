  It was possibly the most expensive meeting Itchko Ezratti will ever attend.<P>

   By the time the powwow of school district officials and Southwest Broward builders ended Wednesday morning, Ezratti, president of G.L. Homes, was being talked into a new line of construction:<P>

   How about building us a kindergarten center, the school leaders asked?<P>

   He didn't say no.<P>

   Such is the state of the classroom shortage in Southwest Broward.<P>

   School Board member Diana Wasserman, whose district includes all of Broward west of University Drive and south of Broward Boulevard, invited developers to talk about the lack of schools in the neighborhoods they are building from Weston to Miramar.<P>

   Every company she invited -- including Lennar, Arvida and Engle Homes -- sent a representative.<P>

   Wasserman was hoping the meeting would produce another Walter Collins. He's the Davie home builder who bought the right to build more homes in Forest Ridge with a promise to build a $250,000 portable kindergarten center at Silver Ridge Elementary in Davie.<P>

   No white knight rode in Wednesday. Just Ezratti, who arrived with strong opinions about the nature of the problem -- ``It's a war,'' he said -- and left with a yellow pad full of notes about what portables cost.<P>

 Ezratti is the biggest builder in SilverLakes, a 5,200-home development spanning the Pembroke Pines-Miramar border.<P>

   He's also building Silver Shores, a 1,265-home development, just west of I-75 in Miramar.<P>

   The homes his company alone will build will generate several thousand new students in the next few years. And neighborhoods are under construction to the north, south and east of his projects.<P>

   ``Occasionally on a weekend I drive up and down Dykes Road and what I see scares me to death,'' said Superintendent Frank Petruzielo.<P>

   Never heard of Dykes Road? Until a year ago, it didn't even exist. Now it's a major north-south artery in western Pembroke Pines and Miramar, flanked on both sides by subdivisions-in-the-making -- Towngate, Spring Valley, Pembroke Shores.<P>

   Of the 19 schools in the district's five-year construction plan, only one is in this area -- an elementary in Miramar, needed to relieve crowding at Sea Castle Elementary School. There is no money to build schools in Weston, Cooper City or Pembroke Pines.<P>

   Meanwhile, houses continue to go up at an astounding pace -- 18,000 new homes in Broward last year, nearly three quarters of them single-family homes.<BR>
Enrollment is huge<P>

   As a result, Broward school enrollment is growing at double the state average.<P>

   Of the 10,000 new students the school district expects will enroll next school year, 6,000 will be in Southwest Broward.<P>

   By fall, Petruzielo predicts the growing gap between the number of students and the number of classroom seats will force some tough decisions.<P>

   ``It's going to make this half-day kindergarten debate look like child's play,'' he said.<P>

   Informed parents -- mostly the moms who run Southwest Broward's PTAs -- know it's coming. And they are not happy.<P>

   ``These parents are so terribly upset, they are ready to make placards and picket all of you,'' Wasserman told the developers. ``I'm trying to derail that train.''<BR>
Few options<BR>
<P>

  So school leaders outlined the options.<P>

   There aren't many.<P>

   Year-round schooling expands a building's capacity by only about 20 percent and has caused different problems in communities that have experimented with it.<P>

   Boundary changes and enrollment caps are no answer either, because crowding has become a countywide problem.<P>

   Ten years ago, the school district closed east Broward schools because of dwindling enrollment. No more. A wave of immigrants from Caribbean and South American nations has made empty seats increasingly hard to find anywhere in Broward.<P>

   Federal and state funds for school construction have not materialized, despite the district's persistent lobbying efforts.<P>

   For instance: A proposal to make the buyers of existing homes pay a fee toward school construction at the time of closing -- called the real estate transfer tax -- has been introduced in the Legislature three years running, without success.<P>

   The local effort to raise more money -- the penny sales tax -- went down at the polls last year, failing by a margin of almost 3-1.<P>

   And Petruzielo said reviving the penny tax idea would not forestall double sessions perhaps as early as the 1997 school year. A referendum could not be put before voters again until at least November 1997, and money from it would not be available until mid-1998.<P>

   Impact fees are no answer either, Petruzielo said. This year, they brought in only $3.7 million.<P>

   The district estimates it has $1.7 billion in construction needs in the next seven years.<BR>
Borrowing is one solution<P>

   Petruzielo's only immediate solution is to borrow more money. He plans to recommend the school district borrow as much as $100 million this year.<P>

   The district is spending $25 million a year to retire old debt.<P>

   He also had one direct request:<P>

   ``Developers cannot lie to prospective customers about where schools are going to be,'' he said. ``I read in the newspaper this weekend that there's going to be a school on Atlantic Gulf's property in Miramar. Well, that was news to me.''<P>

   Builders, who agreed to keep meeting with school officials to work on solutions, warned they could not solve the problem alone.<P>

   Home builders' construction costs have gone up 25 percent since a new building code went into effect in the past year, said Lisa Maxwell, a lobbyist for the South Florida Builders Association.<P>

   And big developments -- communities such as Weston, Chapel Trail and SilverLakes, which have the greatest ability to make a bold move -- are reaching build-out.<P>

   ``The development community is not lacking the will to help, but the huge [subdivisions] are largely done,'' Maxwell said. ``The capability to build whole schools is not going to be there.''
