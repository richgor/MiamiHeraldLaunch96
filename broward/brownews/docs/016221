<m0>   Two women pulled an 18-year-old from a burning car Sunday morning after the teen, who was driving against traffic on U.S. 441, struck a utility pole.<ep>
   The accident occurred just after 7:30 a.m. when Fabian Salgado, of 4189 Lakeside Dr., Tamarac, was heading south in the northbound lanes of U.S. 441.<ep>
   Fatigued and under the influence of alcohol, Salgado was unaware he was traveling against traffic, police said.<ep>
   He swerved to avoid an oncoming car, and smashed into a utility pole near Northwest 12th Street in Lauderhill. His car bounced five feet.<ep>
   Motorists Karen Clementson of Lauderhill and Herma Rodgers of Coral Springs arrived on the scene seconds later as they traveled north on U.S. 441 .<ep>
   When the two discovered someone was still inside the smoking car in their path, they stopped. Salgado sat, hunched in his seat with blood on his shirt and forehead.<ep>
   ``I got out and she got out, and we went to him. We thought he was in shock,'' Rodgers said. ``When we started to take him out, there were flames coming out of the engine. By the time we got him on the ground, the whole car was in flames. I thought, `Oh my God, this boy could have been killed.' ''<ep>
   Paramedics arrived minutes later, and took Salgado to Broward General Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale.<ep>
   The teen told police he fell asleep behind the wheel after consuming alcohol. Police and rescue workers said they smelled alcohol on Salgado's breath. A blood sample was taken for blood alcohol content screening.<ep>
   Rodgers, a registered nurse, was on her way to see a client when she stopped to help save Salgado. ``It's my job, I'm a nurse,'' she said. ``I just did what I had to do.''<ql>
