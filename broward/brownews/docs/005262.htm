   Eric Perlyn, a Fort Lauderdale student, didn't pay much attention to shoes. But that eventually changed and led to Perlyn's selection Monday as a national winner in the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards.<P>

   Perlyn, 18, has donated about 5,000 new shoes to needy children, many of whom had never owned a new pair of sneakers, he said.<P>

   ``I call them magic shoes, really,'' Perlyn said. ``It does a lot more than protect their feet. It changes their attitude and their self esteem as well.''<P>

   Perlyn is among 10 honorees culled from an initial field of 7,000 across the nation, said Lew Armistead, program spokesperson for the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards. A middle school student near St. Petersburg also was honored, making Florida and Oklahoma the only states with two honorees each among the 10.<P>

   Perlyn will receive $5,000 and a gold medallion, Armistead said. Pine Crest Preparatory School in Fort Lauderdale, where Perlyn is a senior, will receive a crystal trophy, he said.<P>

   Perlyn is a thoughtful student, said Pine Crest Principal Lee Turner.<P>

   ``He cares about other people,'' Turner said. ``You don't often find that in kids today. And he's a good student, too.''<P>

   Perlyn said he is thrilled with the honor.<P>

   ``I'm still in shock from it,'' he said.<P>

   The urge to help people directly, rather than writing a check, is what started the project, called Stepp'n Up, Perlyn said. He started the program six years ago by walking into shoe stores and asking for donations of sneakers.<P>

   In the first year, he collected about 175 shoes. That grew to about 1,000 last year, he said. People need to help the less fortunate, he said.<P>

   ``This project has taught me to see the real world,'' Perlyn said. ``My life is not necessarily the real world. I happen to be very fortunate. There are people who are far less fortunate than I am and we need to help them.''
