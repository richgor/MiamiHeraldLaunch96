  Here is how Broward-related issues fared in the legislative session that ended at 2 a.m. Saturday in Tallahassee. Bills that passed still need Gov. Lawton Chiles' approval before becoming law.<BR>
PASSED<BR>
<P>

 Annexation: Future annexations in Broward will need approval of the legislative delegation, but won't require approval by the annexing community in a referendum. Also, Dania and the county agreed to a land swap and an end to a long-running dispute over runway expansion at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.<P>

  Fishing museum: The International Game Fish Association gets a $15 million rebate of sales taxes to help build a new world headquarters in Dania on land adjacent to a Bass Pro sports superstore.<BR>
<P>

 Fireworks: Operators of commercial fireworks displays must comply with a national fire safety code, a response to a fatal fireworks explosion on the Pompano Beach pier in 1994.<P>

  Maternity stays: Mothers and newborns can count on health-care coverage in the hospital and at home for as long as a doctor considers ``medically necessary.'' A growing trend known as ``drive-through deliveries'' means mothers often go home within 24 hours.<P>

   HMO ombudsman: Patients of health-maintenance organizations can complain to a statewide ombudsman committee or one of 11 regional citizen ombudsman boards on the quality of HMO care.<BR>
<P>

  Hair testing: Hair testing could be used as an alternative to urinalysis to test for drugs in the workplace, a change that helps sports mogul H. Wayne Huizenga, a major shareholder in a hair-testing company.<BR>
<P>

 Poker rooms: Bettors at horse and dog tracks and jai-alai frontons can bet up to $10 a pot on card games. The city of Hallandale, the only city with two tracks, will receive an estimated $250,000 a year in revenue.<P>

  State butterfly: The zebra longwing butterfly -- a popular attraction at Butterfly World in Coconut Creek -- is an official state symbol.<BR>
<P>

 Weston-Bonaventure: Weston residents will vote on cityhood in a referendum Sept. 3; residents of Bonaventure will vote on April 1, 1997, whether to join Weston or Sunrise.<BR>
FAILED<BR>
<P>

 Abortion: Doctors will not be required to delay performing abortions for 24 hours while they explain the risks and alternatives of an abortion to pregnant women.<P>

  Bowling: Bowling centers would have faced less risk to potential lawsuits by warning bowlers of the inherent dangers in the popular game.<BR>
  Gambling: ``Cruises to nowhere,'' or offshore gambling ships, which have multiplied in Broward in the past year, may continue to operate off the Florida coast.<P>

  Smaller districts: Voters will not have a say on a proposed amendment to the Constitution to break up large countywide school districts into smaller districts.<P>

  New schools: Lawmakers rejected a bid to have home buyers pay higher taxes on recorded deeds to help pay for construction of new schools, and ease the shortage of Broward classrooms.<P>

  Nursing homes: Federal regulations designed to protect nursing home patients would have been the law in Florida at a time when Congress is considering changes to Medicaid.<P>

  Seat belts: Police won't be able to stop motorists and write tickets for not wearing seat belts. They must continue to issue seat belt citations only after they discover another traffic violation.<BR>
<P>

 Underage smokers: Minors caught possessing cigarettes would have faced $25 fines and driver license suspensions for repeat violations.
