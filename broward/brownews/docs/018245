<m0>   The Brazilian Olympic soccer team apparently is saying, ``Thanks, but no thanks,'' to Davie's offer of free room and board on the campus of Nova Southeastern University.<ep>
   The university has been working for months to prepare accommodations for more than 200 players from teams that will compete July 20-28 in preliminary and semifinal matches at the Orange Bowl in Miami.<ep>
   The Olympic Village will have tight security, a post office, drugstore, bank, convenience store, clinic, travel agent, dry cleaner and even a hairdresser. But the high-profile Brazilian players want more.<ep>
   Tom Mulroy is president of Soccer Marketing and Promotions in Dade, the company hired to advise the South Florida Olympic Soccer Group. About four months ago, Mulroy and a delegation from the Brazilian team scoured the tri-county area in search of the perfect hotel. The criteria (--) good security and lots of it.<ep>
   ``We took them everywhere. They are looking for the finest hotels. Where would the president stay? That's the kind of security they need,'' Mulroy said. And the Davie dorms? ``There was never a chance that they were staying there. It was never an option,'' Mulroy said.<ep>
   ``I don't get it,'' said Jeff Darbro. He owns Davie Boot and Saddle Repair, and will have the concession on cleat repairs and athletic shoes at the village. ``After all the trouble they went through to set this thing up, I think it's kind of inconsiderate for [Brazil] to go somewhere else.''<ql>

<m0>  So where will they stay? Team representatives were negotiating Thursday with the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, but nothing had been confirmed Thursday evening.<ql>

<m0>   Among local Brazilians, the opportunity to watch world-class soccer, and to cheer in person for players from their homeland, is golden. Some are sorry the team will likely stay in Dade County, but it won't stop them from heading to the Orange Bowl.<ep>
   ``I don't think they know that a large number of Brazilians live in Broward. We're disappointed,'' said Zigomar Vuelma, editor of Gazeta Brazilian News, a local Portuguese-language newspaper.<ep>
``I guess Broward just seems too far.'' <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``I would love for them to be closer, but I understand why they're going to Miami,'' said Charliston Seixas, owner of Brazil Samba restaurant in Hollywood. It's much more Brazilian-friendly, with more people that speak Portuguese. It will be an easier transition, and I'll be at the games, anyway.''<ep>
  Those who will likely stay at the village include men's teams from France, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, Nigeria and Brazil, and women's teams from China, Denmark and Sweden.<ep>
   Even their participation is not official yet, but a campus tour and site inspection this week by team representatives from all nine countries left officials optimistic.<ep>
   ``They were all very impressed with it,'' said Tony Correa, competition manager for the South Florida Olympic Committee. ``We expect that most teams will stay at the village. If they don't stay in the village, they are on their own (--) for security, food and training. That's our hands-off policy if a team decides to go out of the loop.''<ep>
 The Brazilian team is expected to arrive in town July 15, after a benefit match at Giants Stadium in New York.<ep>
   ``The Brazilians are on a different page,'' Mulroy said. ``You aren't taking a guy who is on the same level as Air Jordan and putting him in the dorm . . . No offense to the college.''<ql>
