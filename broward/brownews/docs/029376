   Russell Barakat, the Broward Democratic Party chairman convicted of filing a false 1989 tax return, had a chance to fix his return in 1991. He didn't get around to it.<ep>
   He had a second chance in 1993, when federal prosecutors told him he was under investigation. His lawyers advised against it.<ep>
   He had a third chance in 1995, when he was indicted. Instead, his attorneys tried to get the case tossed. They failed.<ep>
   Finally, three days before trial in 1996, Barakat submitted an amended return.<ep>
   It was too late.<ep>
   A jury convicted him Monday of filing a false tax return. He was acquitted of a more serious charge, mail fraud conspiracy.<ep>
   With the jury's verdict, one question flares: Why didn't Barakat file an amended tax return earlier?<ep>
   ``That's America's most popular question,'' his lawyer, Edward Kay, acknowledged Tuesday.<ep>
   ``When you look back with 20/20 hindsight, it appears if he had filed the amended return in 1991, he would have been acquitted. If he filed between 1993 and the time he was indicted, he would have been acquitted. And if he filed after he was indicted, he might have been acquitted.''<ep>
   Still, Kay argues, there were sound legal reasons (--) at least in 1993 and 1995 (--) why Barakat did not act.<ep>
   Here's what happened:<ep>
   The feds came to Barakat in early 1991, as they investigated alleged political corruption in Broward. They did so after spotting five 1989 checks written to him from the law office trust account of Eli Louis Fields, a central figure in the corruption probe later convicted of tax fraud and racketeering.<ep>
   The government wanted to know why Fields had paid him. Barakat explained they had done consulting work for a Tennessee housing firm, which paid $15,000 to Fields, who gave $9,666 of it to Barakat.<ep>
   Afterward, Barakat realized he hadn't reported the income on his taxes. The feds had not yet pulled his tax return.<ep>
   ``Why he didn't do it then, I don't know,'' lawyer Kay said.<ep>
   More than two years later, things got serious. In December 1993, the U.S. attorney's office sent Barakat a letter indicating he was the target of a federal grand jury probe over the same $9,666.<ep>
  The potential charges: bribery, money laundering, wire fraud, mail fraud.<ep>
   Kay said he advised Barakat not to file an amended return. Tax charges were the least of their worries. Kay feared an amended filing could be construed as an admission of guilt to more serious charges (--) bribery, money laundering, fraud.<ep>
   ``When he became a target, it became a real legal question,'' Kay said. ``The fact that he is a target put me in a tough dilemma. If on one hand, I tell him to file an amended return, it appears to be an admission.<ep>
   ``He took the advice of counsel not to do it.''<ep>
   Barakat was indicted May 3, 1995.<m2><ql>
