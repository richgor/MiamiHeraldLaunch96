<m0>  Nova Blanche Forman Elementary School has somehow lost track of time.<ep>
   Like long-lost treasure, a pair of time capsules put into the ground 30 years ago are nowhere to be found.<ep>
   No marker. Few clues. Just a few fuzzy memories.<ep>
   To usher in their school's 30th birthday, students and teachers hoped to unearth the jars filled with mementos from Nova Blanche Forman's inaugural year.<ep>
   ``We started digging in a few places and we couldn't find them,'' said Assistant Principal Marion Gundling, who led the unsuccessful expedition.<ep>
   The students and teachers at the Davie school learned a valuable lesson: A lot can happen with the passage of time.<ep>
  A few theories are bouncing around the school.<ep>
  One, that the time capsules are buried under the school's new asphalt parking lot. In which case, history is history.<ep>
  Or, that they're under two trees out front.<ep>
  Kindergarten teacher Constance Bivens thinks it's a matter of getting through the dirt.<ep>
   Bivens, a teacher at Nova Blanche Forman during its formative years, remembers the capsules were buried under the two black olive trees in front of the school's main entrance at 3521 Davie Rd.<ep>
   ``They're supposed to be under those two trees,'' said Bivens, who does admit she was absent on the day the jars were buried. ``They are down in the ground someplace.''<ep>
   That is the only thing Nova staffers agree on: The jars are <m0>somewhere.<m0><ep>
   The school has given up on finding the time capsules, but students and faculty are celebrating their school's milestone all week with dress-up days and birthday cake.<ep>
   Although they can't make up for lost time, this year's Nova students plan to bury another time capsule on Friday.<ep>
   A school button, T-shirt, birthday mug and other items will be put into the ground.<ep>
   This time, the school will take a few precautions. The kids want their kids to find some memories when they dig up the time capsules a few decades from now.<ep>
   Said Gundling: ``Our next time capsule will have a permanent marker, and we'll register it with a national time-capsule registry.''<ql>
