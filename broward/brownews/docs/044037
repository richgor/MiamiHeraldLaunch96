<m0>ike thousands of others, Adrienne and Howard Rosen bought a home in Southwest Broward in the 1990s and looked forward to son Ryan's first day in kindergarten.<ep>
   Preschool isn't free school, after all.<ep>
   Now the Rosens, who both work full time, and many of their neighbors are sweating a new problem.<ep>
   The school Ryan is supposed to enter this fall, Chapel Trail Elementary, is one of three in Broward that will offer only half-day kindergarten this year.<ep>
   After years of threats that the flood of new students would force schools to drastically change the way they do business, the future has arrived at Chapel Trail, Silver Palms and Country Isles elementaries.<ep>
   It is not rosy.<ep>
   Adrienne Rosen worries that her early-rising son will wind up, through the luck of the draw, in an afternoon session. She's frustrated that until he is assigned a session, sometime in late June, she can't make arrangements for the rest of his day, or figure out what it's going to cost.<ep>
   This is not what she envisioned when she bought a home in Pembroke Pines' SilverLakes community.<ep>
   ``There are a lot of irate parents out here,'' Adrienne Rosen said. ``All of us had one of these wonderful salespeople who told us, `Don't worry about the schools. They'll be there.' ''<ep>
   They're not.<ep>
   Parents breathing a sigh of relief because their school escaped half-day kindergarten this year should not relax too quickly.<ep>
   With less money for construction and more students expected next year, half-day kindergarten, double sessions and year-round schooling are likely to become more common.<ep>
   Although nobody likes it, half-day kindergarten is perhaps the least painful of a school's options. The classrooms freed up by offering only a half-day program can be used to ease the strain in other grades.<ep>
   Chapel Trail, for instance, expects to have five kindergarten classrooms this fall, down from the 11 it has now.<ep>
   The school also expects some parents will reject the half-day offering and make other arrangements for their 5-year-olds.<ep>
   Parents who already have a child enrolled in a full-day preschool program may keep them in private school one more year, rather than have them change schools and have to be transported in the middle of the day to a different facility.<ep>
   But that convenience does not come cheap: Tuition runs from $3,600 at Weston's First Baptist Church (there is a waiting list for the fall) to $5,000 at the Cambridge Learning Center in Pembroke Pines.<ep>
   To compare: A full load of classes at Broward Community College costs $1,100 a year.<ql>
<m1>Stopgap measure<ep>
<m0>   But half-day kindergarten only buys one year. It's the year after that principals are worried about.<ep>
   ``The real challenge is: What are we going to do for them when they get to first grade?'' says Chapel Trail Principal Dorothy Cook.<ep>
   That's a question that will be asked on more Broward school campuses next year as other schools reach the brink.<ep>
   Take Silver Palms Elementary, for instance.<ep>
   The school opened for kindergarten through fourth grade this year on a portable site in Cooper City.<ep>
   Its yellow and peach building, flanking the west side of Interstate 75 in the Towngate subdivision, is still a construction site.<ep>
   Silver Palms went up quickly because it was part of the Pembroke Pines special assessment district (--) a city-led initiative to get an elementary and middle school in western Pines built fast.<ql>
<m1>Just in the nick of time<ep>
<m0>   Good thing, too. There are 720 children enrolled at Silver Palms this week. By the time it opens in August, the school expects 1,489.<ep>
   By August 1997: 2,031.<ep>
   By the year 2000: 3,861.<ep>
   ``That special assessment district did get two schools built, but it was a Band-Aid,'' said Suzy Powell, a Chapel Trail parent whose third-grade son has been schooled at three different sites since he started kindergarten.<ep>
   Powell also has a child scheduled to enter kindergarten at Chapel Trail this fall.<ep>
   ``It's frustrating,'' she said. ``I was hoping to go back to work full time this year.''<ep>
   Half-day kindergarten is actually two-thirds of a traditional day.<ep>
   Instead of 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., parents will have to choose between morning or afternoon sessions, each four hours long.<ep>
   The curriculum bonuses (--) music, art, science, physical education (--) will be integrated into the four-hour day as much as possible. Lunch will be served only to those who request it.<ep>
   All three schools will offer after-school care from 4:30 to 6 p.m. only for the afternoon session, for $2 a day.<ep>
   ``We had to do something to make the afternoon session more enticing to people,'' said Pam Clark, Country Isles PTA president. ``From what I hear, everybody wants the morning session.''<ep>
   Parents will have the option of asking for a one-year reassignment to a school offering full-day kindergarten, but they would have to provide transportation.<ql>
<m1>Day-care options<ep>
<m0>   Schools also are working with local day-care providers to develop a roster of options for working parents, including morning care with transportation to the school at midday or transportation from the school at midday to a day-care center.<ep>
   And some private providers see an opportunity for even more growth.<ep>
   Cambridge Learning Center, halfway between Chapel Trail and Silver Palms elementaries, has seven children in its kindergarten this year.<ep>
   But 30 already have registered for next year, so the private school is planning at least two kindergarten classes for the fall.<ql>
