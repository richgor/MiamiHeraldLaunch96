<m0>   The Stealth fighter, an arrowhead cutting through the sky during last year's Shell Air & Sea Show, is what pointed the way for Mike Munger, 19, of Fort Lauderdale.<ep>
   Munger said the plane was part of the reason he decided to join the United States Air Force, where he plans to become an aircraft mechanic.<ep>
   ``When I saw that fly over, it was incredible,'' Munger said. ``It made me make my decision a little sooner.''<ep>
   Munger was among the promoters, pilots, military brass and green recruits who attended a news conference heralding this weekend's invasion of roaring planes and splashing speedboats at the 1996 Shell Air & Sea Show on Saturday and Sunday at Fort Lauderdale beach.<ep>
   The U.S. Navy Blue Angels will perform in this year's show. The United States Air Force Thunderbirds flew at last year's show. For the military, the event is a chance to show where a portion of your tax dollars go, although that's not its main reason, said U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Bill Turner.<ep>
   ``The primary purpose is recruiting,'' he said. ``And secondary is to show off the wares of the military.''<ep>
   Holly Andrews, 19, of Margate, also saw the show last year and is now a nurse's assistant in the Air Force. She said she was impressed at how everyone worked together at last year's show.<ep>
   ``It's just one big happy family,'' she said.<ep>
   The Shell Air & Sea show includes nonmilitary aerial acts as well, like the TresCom Lima Lima Flight Team, a civilian aerial team flying 1950s-vintage training planes once used by the Navy.<ep>
   Why is it called Lima, Lima?<ep>
   It stands for LL, which in turn, stands for LL-10, the call sign for the group's home airport in Naperville, Ill., explained team pilot Rick Gretz. Other pilots joke with the team, calling them the Lima Lima Beans, he said.<ep>
   Another unusual bird is the Bud Light Micro Jet, billed as the world's smallest jet. The plane isn't much bigger than a few kegs of beer.<ep>
   The little plane is 12 feet long and 5 1/2 feet high with a wingspan of 17 feet. But it's a lot faster than a keg of beer, with a top speed of 350 miles per hour.<ep>
   It's flown by Leo Loudenslager, a champion aerobatic pilot, who said that if the Micro Jet were melted down it would supply enough tin for 750,000 beer cans. The small jet requires weights on the front end to keep it from tipping backward when parked. The weights are lead replicas of (--) what else (--) Bud Light beer cans.<ep>
   Flying over water for the Air & Sea Show is extra demanding, Loudenslager said. That's because depth perception is tougher, although choppy seas help, he said.<ep>
   ``When you first do it, it's a little apprehensive,'' he said.<ql>
