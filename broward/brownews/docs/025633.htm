   The private company that monitors the force of limestone explosions in West Broward charged Monday that a recent series of articles by The Herald unfairly exaggerated the damage potential of blasts in Weston.<P>

   Most of the 33 blasts listed by The Herald as illegal were acknowledged in reports by GeoSonics Inc. and submitted to Broward County regulators. But GeoSonics Vice President Jeffrey Straw said many of those that measured high were technically in compliance because of where they were measured by his company's seismographs. A blast is not officially illegal, he said, if the measurement was taken at a commercial building or new home still owned by the developer.<P>

   Straw said measurements in Weston were taken close to blast sites, far enough from the established residential neighborhoods that damage was unlikely. He blamed one excessive blast on a misfire. <P>

   ``The recent Miami Herald articles have produced an amount of apprehension and misinformation about the blasting process and enforcement,'' Straw said in a report submitted to the Indian Trace Community Development District.<P>

   In cases where vibration limits were exceeded, county regulators often intervened and stopped blasting activities, he said.<P>

   ``We don't have police power,'' Straw said, defending GeoSonic's role. ``The county is the only one that does that.''<P>

   The district board, a five-member panel that oversees development of Weston, requested a report from GeoSonics after a Herald examination of blasting oversight in Broward County.<P>

    The Herald report, published April 14-16, listed 106 illegal explosions that shook Broward County during the past five years.<P>

   As the ``seismologist of record,'' GeoSonics is paid to measure the force of explosions and report results to developers and local governments.<P>

   GeoSonics also investigates damage claims. The company has not linked any damage to blasting, instead blaming house cracks on natural settling and poor workmanship.<P>

   Besides the 33 excessive blasts reported in Weston, The Herald reported others in Pembroke Pines (44), Plantation (15), Coral Springs (three), Tamarac (two) and unincorporated areas of the county (nine).<P>

   Most illegal blasts were unknown to the more than 1,000 homeowners who filed officials protests and submitted damage claims. <P>

   Some residents received repairs or cash awards through private settlements with developers. In March, arbitrators hired by Pembroke Pines ordered repairs or payments to 40 families.<P>

   Developers, however, argue that blasting has not damaged homes. Ground vibrations have not caused cracks but merely brought defects to the attention of worried homeowners who inspected their houses.<P>

   Blasting is a tool used by developers to prepare West Broward marshland for building. The explosions dig drainage lakes and carve shoreline for waterfront lots as developers expand suburbia.<P>

   Limits on ground vibrations vary in Broward but generally are based on guidelines recommended by federal researchers. Dade regulators impose stricter limits, especially in residential neighborhoods.<P>

   In examining the improper blasts in Broward, The Herald found several cases in which homeowners were told blasts were within legal limits when records show they were not.<P>

   In addition, scientific evidence used by blasters to reject damage claims is based mostly on studies of wood-frame houses that sit near Indiana coal fields -- not the concrete and stucco construction commonly found in South Florida. A 1995 follow-up study of blasting in Weston, used to support the Indiana research, examined two houses. Neither was subjected to illegal blasts.<P>

   As a result of The Herald's reporting on the issue, county regulators who oversee blasting in Weston and other communities have passed new policies aimed at keeping families informed:<P>

   The seismologist must notify homeowners when a blasting permit is revoked for excessive ground vibrations. And homeowners seeking repair awards before a county hearing officer are entitled to copies of blast measurements.<P>

   The Herald's report was criticized earlier by officials at Arvida, the company that oversees development in Weston. They charge the newspaper presented information unfairly and neglected successes in regulating blasting.<P>

   Weston's Indian Trace Community Development District in 1993 instituted a dispute resolution process that gives homeowners the option of bringing their complaints to a committee.
