<m0>  Robert Roman, Debbie Crum and Doris Barnett don't just want to fight Pembroke Pines City Hall. They want to conquer it. <ep>
   Along with a handful of government groupies, the trio (--) two of them defeated candidates in this year's municipal election (--) is putting together a watchdog group to follow city business. They split from Pines Citizens for Good Government, a once-strong civic organization that's lost leaders and members.<ep>
   Long frustrated by a city they say is insensitive to the public, Roman, Crum and Barnett vow to change city policies and oust the people who make them.<ep>
   ``We are going to continuously let our elected officials know that `You are not going to do business as usual,' '' said Roman, a Chapel Trail resident and insurance agent. <m1> <ep>
<m0>   This spinoff organization plans to pass out petitions to oppose blasting in the city, picket blasting sites and seek public support for a referendum to ban the use of explosives in Pines. <ep>
   Another target is the commission. They want term limits so no one can monopolize the dais and sit on the commission for 20 years like the late mayor Chuck Flanagan.<ep>
   The prospect of being monitored closely doesn't faze Frank Ortis, the city's newest commissioner. He says he doesn't mind the criticism. He just wants people to be nice. <ep>
   ``Criticism in a constructive manner is fine,'' Ortis said. <ep>
   Roman, Crum and Don Sinclair, also a founding member of the unnamed group, were candidates in the March election. Crum, who runs a home day care, ran for the District 3 seat against Ortis and three other candidates. Sinclair, a bail bondsman, opposed Commissioner Bill Armstrong for the District 2 commission seat. Roman ran against Mayor Alex Fekete.<ep>
   Ortis says some of the harsh criticism aimed at commissioners and City Hall is leftover campaign rhetoric.<ep>
   ``Some people don't realize the election is over,'' Ortis said.<ep>
   The March election was unusually mean. Candidates fought over where to put their signs. Incumbents, who netted donations from developers, large landowners and their families, were criticized for their connections. <ep>
   Few were spared the insults and accusations. Roman even changed his home phone, cellular and beeper numbers because of crank calls from people threatening to kill him and his family. <ep>
   The bitter feelings from the election, however, didn't fuel the creation of the civic group, said Barnett, a Century Village resident and active member of the local Democratic Party.<ep>
   The ``many inequities in this beautiful city of Pembroke Pines,'' forced the creation of a new civic group, she said. <ep>
   The group says commissioners reward campaign backers by approving their projects and giving them government contracts and appointments to city advisory boards.<ep>
   Roman, Sinclair, Crum and Barnett say there is no room at City Hall for anyone who opposes city leaders and they're testing their theory. They each applied to serve on all 12 city advisory boards and predict they won't be appointed.<ep>
   They likely are right. Mayor Fekete said he doesn't plan to support their nominations.<ep>
   ``You don't think I'll allow my enemies here,'' he said. <ep>
   Removing commissioners from office remains a primary goal. Barnett said the group is looking for someone to oppose Vice Mayor Kitty Thibault and Commissioner Ben Fiorendino when they are up for re-election in two years. <ep>
   Getting people to listen might not be that easy. Despite the city's detractors, City Hall has plenty of supporters faithful to government leaders. <ep>
   At the last commission meeting, Roman criticized the mayor, saying he mistreats critics and is often rude to them. Angry Fekete supporters booed and told Roman, whose family is Puerto Rican, to ``go back to Cuba.''<ep>
   Battling City Hall can turn into a full-time job with little pay. Several vocal government critics have gone into retirement after few years battling government. <m1> <ep>
<m0>   Former commissioner Mike Rubinstein, a longtime critic of Pines elected officials, dropped out of public life after losing his bid for mayor and fighting two lawsuits to remove him from office and as a candidate in the last election. Government critic and former commissioner Charlie Nelson has scaled back attendance at commission meetings.<ep>
   Pines Citizens for Good Government, which was active in the fight against blasting and other civic issues for about two years, is no longer as influential. The group failed in its efforts to end blasting and to recall Thibault, and it no longer meets regularly.<ep>
   Pines resident Peter Yellin, founder of Pines Citizens, says watching City Hall takes too much time and costs too much money. After leading efforts to recall Thibault and ban blasting, Yellin has gone back to his law practice.<ep>
   ``It became a full-time job. I just can't devote the time nor the leadership to keep involved in the community,'' he said. ``I had to get back to work.''<ql>
