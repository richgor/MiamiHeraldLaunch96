<m0>   FREEPORT, Bahamas (--) (AP) (--) About 800 passengers were evacuated from a Discovery cruise ship Wednesday after a fire broke out in the engine room just offshore from this resort town.<ep>
   Thick black smoke could be seen from Freeport as tugboats with the Bahamas Oil Refinery Co. went out to assist Discovery I, which had sailed from Port Everglades. Three of the company's tugboats towed the ship back to Freeport about 3 p.m., The Nassau Tribune reported.<ep>
   The passengers were evacuated safely, and no injuries were reported, said U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Jeff Hall. The Coast Guard sent two marine-safety advisers to counsel the cruise staff, but was not directly involved in the towing or evacuation.<ep>
   ``It was really nerve-racking being on the boat,'' said passenger Cindy Maze, who left the ship in Freeport. ``It's been really bad. There was smoke everywhere and 10-foot flames. It was really scary.''<ep>
   Roberta Baccas, spokeswoman for Discovery in Fort Lauderdale, said she heard reports of a detached fuel line in the ship's engine room.<ep>
   She said that when the boat was three miles outside of Freeport Harbor, ``we were informed of the fire by the ship's captain, who had decided to shut the engines down to avoid further damage or hazard to passengers.''<ep>
   Hall said: ``They ignited their CO<m2>2<m0> [carbon dioxide] system when they knew the fire was down there, and that put it out. But they opened the compartment too quickly, and it reflashed.''<ep>
   Baccas said she had no estimate of the damage.<ep>
   `We have not been able to determine yet what really caused this, or how we are going to correct it because the crew has not been able to get to the engine room because of the heat and smoke,'' she said.<ep>
   Discovery was making arrangements to bring the passengers home on other cruise liners leaving Freeport, she said.<ep>
