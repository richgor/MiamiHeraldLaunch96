ill Gauwitz and his wife, Donna, honeymooned in Florida.<P>

  The Midwesterners also have vacationed in Mexico, Hawaii, Arizona and California.<P>

  Among all those places, Florida was their favorite.<P>

  So when a golf management job opened in Hollywood, the Gauwitzes, from Peoria, Ill., were ready to change addresses.<P>

  ``The city of Hollywood, they say, is the Diamond of the Gold Coast,'' Bill Gauwitz said. ``It's true.''<P>

  Gauwitz was hired from about 90 applicants as the city's general manager of golf operations, overseeing Orangebrook Golf and Country Club, Eco Grande Golf Course and Hollywood Beach Golf Course.<P>

  Assistant City Manager Cameron Benson said Gauwitz has the experience and vision to transform a low-key city golf operation into one that is more attractive to the public.<P>

  ``I think he is the person to provide the type of leadership we're looking for that will turn all the pieces -- that at one time had become fragmented -- into a coordinated machine -- the driving range, the pro shop, the banquet facilities, the restaurant and lounge,'' he said.<P>

  Gauwitz had been interested in golf courses since he worked on one as a landscaper. For him, golf courses were an ideal combination of sports, outdoors, landscaping and people.<P>

  ``I enjoy meeting with the golfers and the public,'' he said. ``They are out there to enjoy themselves. It makes me feel good that I participate in their recreation activity.''<P>

  Gauwitz received a bachelor's degree in recreation and park administration and horticulture from Western Illinois University at Macomb.<P>

  He worked nine years at Mount Hawley Country Club in Peoria and 13 years as golf manager with the Peoria Park District.<P>

  In Hollywood, Gauwitz will earn $25 an hour or $52,000 a year from the golf course fund.<P>

  The city's golf courses function independently from other city budgets. They operate as a business enterprise, running on what they bring in rather than from tax money.<P>

  Gauwitz, 45, said his goals include increasing membership, promoting the golf courses, broadening the programs for children and establishing a master plan for improving the beauty and quality of the courses.<P>

  ``I want to increase the awareness [of the city courses] and provide excellent customer service,'' he said. ``By doing that, you're going to have people want to come back and play golf.''
