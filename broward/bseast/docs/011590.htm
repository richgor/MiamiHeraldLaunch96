llen Dunne tries hard to stay out of the shadow of her older sister, Mary. Like Mary in late 1980s, Ellen is now a star golfer for Cardinal Gibbons. There is a resemblance. People sometimes call her ``Mary'' by mistake. But Ellen Dunne is not Mary.<P>

  Still, in one regard, Ellen wanted to be be just like her sister: Mary Dunne won the FHSAA State Golf Championship individual title in 1989.<P>

  Ellen finished second in 1995 as a junior, and was back at Venice (Fla.) Golf and Country Club last week for her last chance to match her sister's achievement.<P>

  It didn't happen.<P>

  Sometimes in golf you can hit the ball with exquisite precision, but be denied because the putts won't fall. That was Ellen Dunne's fate Wednesday and Thursday.<P>

  The signs were there from the start: She began the tournament with back-to-back three-putts. In the first round, she hit 15 greens, but three-putted five times and shot 74 only because she went on a tear at the end of her round -- she birdied four of her last five holes.<P>

  In the second and final round, she caught the leader with a birdie on No. 2, but then she double-bogeyed No. 4 and three-putted No. 5 for a bogey. Another strong back nine wasn't enough to make up all that ground.<P>

  She took home another silver medal. Second place again. There were about 75 girls at the tournament who would have been thrilled with that. But Dunne could only think of what might have been.<P>

  ``Second is nice,'' Dunne said. ``But I'm disappointed because I know I could have done better.''<P>

  She wanted to call her sister. Mary always knew what to say.<P>

  ``I've always been able to talk to her about golf,'' Ellen said. ``Before state, I was worried about how I was playing. She just said, `Try your best and don't worry about what happens.' She always talks positively when I get down.''<P>

  With her high school career now over, it's time to make the difficult decision about where to go to college.<P>

  She likely will choose between the University of South Florida and the University of Jacksonville. Both have offered scholarships. Both would allow her go away to school while still keeping her a relatively short drive from her home in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.<P>

  She considered going to the University of Miami, which has a better golf program and is closer to home.<P>

  But Mary went there. Ellen isn't sure she wants another four years of playing in Mary's shadow.<P>

  ``I want to go a different way than Mary,'' Ellen said. ``I've always been 'Mary's little sister.' It doesn't bother me anymore. But it's time to be just Ellen.''<BR>
More notes, quotes and random thoughts from the FHSAA State Golf Championships, held last week in Sarasota County:<P>

  <LI> When Steve Scott graduated from Coral Springs last year, the Colts lost more than their No. 1 player. They also lost their competitive leader.<P>

  Robert Hooper, now a Coral Springs senior, fed off Scott's competitiveness, and without Scott around, Hooper feels lost.<P>

  This year, junior Jimmy Lee overtook Hooper for the team's stroke-average leader -- 35.1 to 35.9 -- but neither played well at state. The Colts finished eighth out of 16 teams.<P>

  ``It's not the same with Jimmy and me,'' Hooper said. ``We didn't grow up together like Steve and me. This whole year has been kind of disappointing. There hasn't been that same rivalry among us like there used to be.''<P>

  And so, the Coral Springs dynasty is history. It was good while it lasted -- two state titles (1993, 1995) and a runner-up finish in between. With Hooper graduating, Lee will become the focal point next season. But it will be up to the supporting cast -- Ricky Hooper (Robert's brother), Larry Myers and Brian Pankrantz -- to decide how good the Colts can be.<P>

  The good news for Hooper is that his friendly rivalry with Scott will resume in the fall when Hooper joins him at the University of Florida, where Scott is playing for the Gators now as a freshman.<P>

  <LI> The shot of the tournament belonged to St. Thomas Aquinas' Katie Embick on the last hole of the competition.<P>

  Playing the 18th hole of the Tournament Players Club-Prestancia in Sarasota in the final round of the Class 6A championship, Embick holed out a 100-yard pitching wedge for eagle. The shot capped an 84 and give her an eighth-place finish at 161.<P>

  <LI> Cooper City senior Rich Matricaria, who competed at state as an individual -- having won the individual title in districts -- is heading to the University of Alabama in the fall.<P>

  'Bama guaranteed him a spot on the golf team, and gave him a chance to compete for a scholarship for his sophomore season.<P>

 <LI> Pine Crest's Jeff Walker was robbed of a chance to win the individual title in Class 4A boys when tournament officials made his threesome -- the last group still on the course -- finish the 18th hole in a driving rain.<P>

  Walker wound up making triple-bogey on the hole when he hit into the water twice. As it turns out, he would have needed a birdie to catch Sal Spallone of Vero Beach-St. Edwards.<P>

  But he should have been given the chance. All it would have taken was a 10-minute suspension of play.<P>

  Walker's disappointment was minimal, of course, because Pine Crest won the team title. Walker finished third as an individual.<P>

 <LI> Joshua Smith, who played at state the last two years for American Heritage before moving with his mother to Plant City in January, was back at state this year with Plant City-Durant High, and had a nice reunion with all his Broward County buddies.<P>

  Smith was the individual medalist in his district, but never got into contention at state.
