   Trailing 7-3 in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Hot Shots scored four times to send the game into an extra inning. <m0>John Kiddy <m0>and <m0>D.J. Noble <m0>each hit a double to ignite the rally, and <m0>Nicklaus Atria <m0>scored the tying run.<ep>
   Behind 7-2 in the sixth inning, <m0>Travis Atria <m0>had a key RBI triple. Down 8-7 in the bottom of the eighth, Kiddy tied the game again, and that's the way it ended.<ep>
   <m0>Ismael Miranda, <m0>a first-year player, caught four fly balls in center field to spark the defense. Noble hit two doubles and scored twice, and pitcher <m0>Joey Giordano <m0>allowed two runs, walked none and struck out four in five innings.<ep>

Manning <m0>had a hit. Starting pitcher <m0>Daniel Mirtenbaum <m0>struck out four, walked just one and caught a popup in three solid innings.
