allandale businessman Chuck Forbes has been named Small Business Person of the Year by the Hallandale Chamber of Commerce.<P>

   Forbes is leasing director for the Twelve Fifty East Building, 1250 E. Hallandale Beach Blvd. The building went from being nearly empty four years ago to between 85 and 90 percent full, including the addition of a new health club, Premier Health and Fitness, on the first floor.<P>

   ``Aside from the business and its success, for almost two years now I've watched him and I've been impressed,'' said Leonard Oshinsky, a Hallandale lawyer and the chamber member who nominated Forbes. ``He's provided active leadership and worked hard in the chamber.''<P>

   Aw, shucks, says Forbes. ``I was a little bit surprised. I was honored,'' he said. ``I don't like to toot my own horn.''<P>

   Forbes, 36, lives in Broward County near Fort Lauderdale. He is married and has three sons and proudly reports he is nearly finished with a history degree from Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton.<P>

   As for the building, Forbes says it benefited from the growth of Aventura, just across the county line from Hallandale. Office space is now at a premium in the area, he said. ``My timing was pretty good.''<BR>

   Dania will be the site of the United Way's second benefit fishing tournament.<P>

   Weigh-in and a barbecue will be at 2:30 p.m. May 19 at the I.T. Parker Community Center, 901 NE Third St., Dania. The tournament begins at 7:30 a.m.<P>

   ``The community center is a perfect location. It's right next to Tugboat Annie's,'' a popular waterfront restaurant, said Ellen Calderon, communications manager for the United Way of Broward County. ``And everyone was pretty helpful with it last year in Dania.''<P>

   Deadline to register is May 18. It costs $50 per adult and $25 per child under 13 to participate. The barbecue is free to anglers.<P>

   The event will feature contests in six categories: top boat, top angler, top junior angler, top female angler, best-dressed fishing team and best hard-luck story.<P>

   All proceeds will benefit United Way of Broward County, a volunteer-driven, nonprofit organization that helps one in three families in the county through 45 agencies and programs it funds.<P>

   For information, call the United Way at 462-4850.<P>

  Denni Eisen of Cooper City has been named South Florida representative for three New York State summer camps. Eisen, who has worked for Pine Forest, Lake Owego and Timber Tops camps since January, now recruits campers from the South Florida area.<P>

   She also will oversee 150 children and staff members at Pine Forest this summer. Eisen's two children, Michael, 7, and Jackie, 10, will be first-timers at the camp.<P>

   ``The self-esteem and self-confidence they get at camp lasts with them a lifetime,'' said Eisen, who went to a North Carolina summer camp for 13 years. ``It really teaches them how to be part of a team and also be responsible for themselves.''<BR>
   <LI> Navy Seaman Recruit Scott D. Spallinger, son of David and Kanden S. Spallinger of Plantation, recently completed eight weeks of U.S. Navy basic training. Spallinger, who graduated from South Plantation High School in 1995, was trained in everything from first aid to firefighting at Recruit Training Command in Great Lakes, Ill.<P>

   <LI> Marine Pfc. Peter Svoboda, son of Vladimir Svoboda of Sunrise, recently completed basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Parris Island, S.C. He is a 1995 graduate of J.P. Taravella High School in Coral Springs.
