<m0>earing violence toward Israelis overseas could reach Jews in Pembroke Pines, the city's police department has increased patrols around Temple Beth Emet.<ep>
    Police Chief Martin Rahinsky has told his officers to make frequent checks of the temple at 10801 Pembroke Rd. The Street Crime/Gang Unit also has been assigned to police the temple.<ep>
   ``Under the general threats nationally, it's the prudent thing to do,'' Rahinsky said. ``We are just going to have to evaluate this on a day-to-day basis.''<ep>
   The city's only other Jewish organization, Century Village Jewish Center, in Century Village is easier to protect because it is in a gated community, Rahinsky said. <ep>
   On May 5, the FBI advised U.S. Jewish organizations to be cautious because of a threat to kill 1,200 Jewish executives and doctors unless Israel withdraws its forces from Lebanon and pays $12 billion in compensation.<ep>
   Rahinsky said residents shouldn't panic, but encourages caution.<ep>
   ``I think it's probably a far-out chance percentage-wise. There is not much risk. But we would rather reduce any potential for it,'' he said. <ep>
   Temple leaders are not taking any chances either. Security guards now patrol the four-acre complex. <ep>
   ``We keep our eyes open but we haven't changed our lives,'' said Rabbi Bennett Greenspon. <ep>
   Other area Jewish organizations are equally wary. Caution and extra security have become a way of life. <ep>
   ``All Jewish institutions monitor these kinds of things. They take precautionary measures,'' said Gary N. Rubin, executive director of the South Broward Jewish Federation. <ep>
   The David Posnack Jewish Community Center in Davie has a security system to ensure their members' safety. <ep>
  ``I'm not at liberty to tell you what it is because then it wouldn't be secured,'' said Nancy Steinberg, spokeswoman for the organization. <ep>
   Part of the plan, however, includes working with local police. Davie police are aware of the threats and have increased patrols around the JCC, 5850 Pine Island Rd., said Capt. John George, spokesman for the department.<ql>
