<m0>ith hurricane season just a month away, city officials are urging residents to be prepared.<ep>
   As many snowbirds return to the north for the summer, officials are reminding residents to bring in yard furniture and other items that could blow around in the wind. Come storm time, that plastic lawn chair could become a missile.<ep>
   ``If it's not secured, it's going to be flying into other people's windows,'' said Frank Durkin, code compliance official for Hallandale. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Hallandale has a law against leaving loose items out during hurricane season, June 1-Nov. 30. Put simply, if a homeowner leaves town for more than seven days during hurricane season, the lawn items must come in.<ep>
   That includes cut-down tree limbs, patio furniture, grills and toys, city officials warn. If it's not secure, take it in.<ep>
   ``Every year when there is a possible hurricane hitting, we'll get calls from residents in single-family homes: My neighbors have [tree] limbs in their front yard. `It's going to blow all over the place,' '' Durkin said.<ep>
   The law has never been enforced, but the teeth are there, he said. Fines for failing to comply are $30 for first-time offenders and can rise to $150.<ep>
   Hollywood has no law requiring that residents clear yards, but it just makes sense, said George Keller, the city's director of post-disaster recovery.<ep>
   Generally, the city tries to get the word out through neighborhood associations, Keller said. But before big storms, Hollywood city workers drive through the neighborhoods looking for potential hazards.<ep>
   Potted plants are a problem, Keller said. So are garbage cans. Even unanchored doghouses can become airborne if winds enter the door and lift off the roof.<m1><ep>
<m0>   ``We'd recommend if you go away during the hurricane season, you not only take in your loose objects but you also secure your doors and windows,'' Keller said. ``Because if you're caught out of town, you're not going to be able to return and take care of it.''<ql>
