<m0>eenagers who live in Hollywood's Driftwood neighborhood will have a chance to voice their opinions about local recreation and activities for teens.<ep>
 The <m0>Driftwood Civic Association<m0> <m0>is bringing community leaders together to meet with the neighborhood's youth.<ep>
 The meeting will be at 7 p.m. Monday at the Driftwood Recreation Center, 3000 N. 69th Ave.<ep>
 ``Kids say adults never listen to them,'' said Don Williams, the association's president. ``Well, here is their chance to talk.''<ep>
 Among those listening will be representatives from the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Boys & Girls Club of Broward County, Hollywood Crime Watch, the Hollywood Optimists Club, Hollywood's Police Athletic League, local businesses and local churches.<ep>
 Also attending will be school officials and parents from McArthur High, Hollywood Hills High, Apollo Middle School, Driftwood Middle School, Sheridan Park Elementary, and Driftwood Elementary. All are Hollywood schools that draw students from the Driftwood neighborhood.<ep>
  Williams said about 100 people from the community have been invited to listen to Driftwood's teenagers talk about what the community offers in recreation and what they would like to have added.<ep>
 For details, call 983-6160 or 985-9901.<ql>
<m1>Looking for a new logo<ep>
<m0> The <m0>Hollywood Lakes Section Civic Association<m0> wants a new image (--) literally.<ep>
 The neighborhood group is sponsoring a contest to redesign its association logo.<ep>
 The current logo incorporates the neighborhood's lakes and is used in its letterhead, said association member Ted Tankard.<ep>
 Association members decided to redesign the logo and use it as a way to promote neighborhood pride by making T-shirts, mugs and signs bearing the new logo available to residents.<ep>
 Contestants are urged to use their imagination in designing a logo that incorporates these elements from the neighborhood: a tropical atmosphere with unique architecture, an historic district since September 1995, borders the Intracoastal Waterway and streets that are lined with stately royal palms.<ep>
 Anyone can enter the contest.<ep>
 ``We've had interest from Hollywood and entrants from Fort Lauderdale,'' Tankard said. ``We've also talked to the artists in downtown Hollywood. Since we've supported them in the past, we're hoping they will support us by entering the contest.''<ep>
 About 10 logos have entered so far.<ep>
 Entries will be accepted through May 15, when the association's committee will meet to select a logo to present to the group's board of directors for approval.<ep>
 The winner will receive a T-shirt with the new logo and acknowledgement in the association's newsletter.<ep>
 Contestants should send their entry to: Logo Contest, Hollywood Lakes Section Civic Association, P.O. Box 22-3922, Hollywood, Fla. 33022.<ep>
 For information, contestants can call 925-9436.<ql>
