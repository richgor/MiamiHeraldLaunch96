controversial Pembroke Park facility for juvenile offenders changed hands Wednesday, with the departure of Community Environments Inc. In its place is the nonprofit Agency for Community Treatment Services (ACTS), in Building G at 4900 W. Hallandale Beach Blvd.<P>

   ACTS is stepping up security at the program for boys who are wards of the state and who have committed mostly nonviolent crimes, such as auto theft and burglary.<P>

   Community Environments had problems with security -- kids running away, using drugs, and vandalizing homes, among other incidents -- since the facility opened in August 1994. Town officials wanted the program to leave, saying it posed a threat to the safety and welfare of residents.<P>

   ACTS Regional Director Christina Spudeas said security is being strengthened to calm people's concerns.<P>

   ``We plan on changing the windows so they're unbreakable, and adding video cameras and monitors,'' Spudeas said. ``We've also got a good staff-to-client ratio and a recreation therapist to help the boys work out their anger and aggression through organized activities and sports.''<P>

   Pembroke Park Vice Mayor Karen Janzer, whose 1995 political campaign emphasized opposition to the facility, is taking a wait-and-see attitude with ACTS.<P>

   ``As far as the new security measures, great. I'd try anything at this point,'' she said. ``But as for people's concerns, I think they are still going to feel the same way, that it's in the wrong location.''<P>

   ACTS has a contract with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice to treat as many as 20 boys, age 12 to 17 -- the same boys Community Environments was treating. The department awarded another contract to the agency to treat an additional 20 boys at the location of ACTS' choosing. Spudeas said ACTS ``will be pursuing the building [Building F] directly behind this facility,'' but has no time frame on the expansion.<P>

   Janzer said that would not sit well with the 1.6-square-mile town.<P>

   ``I would not want them to expand or take on more boys, not ever,'' she said.<P>

   ACTS' program opened with 10 boys and 19 staff members. Spudeas said some direct-care staffers were recruited from Community Environments (its contract expired April 30) to give the boys a sense of continuity. The six- to nine-month program is designed to educate and rehabilitate them before they return to their parents or guardians.<P>

   Spudeas said the facility's director, Linda Weinman, would require the boys to perform community service projects. It's a way to reinforce the youngsters' reform and help bring something positive to the town, she said.<P>

   ACTS is seeking recreation equipment, such as Foosball tables and baseball gloves, for boys in its program. Donations are tax-deductible. For details, call Spudeas at 467-4530.
