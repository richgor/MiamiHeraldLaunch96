<m0>he last call for alcohol soon may change in Pembroke Park.<ep>
   Town commissioners will vote on Wednesday whether to amend an ordinance regulating hours of alcohol consumption at nightclubs, lounges and any establishment that serves alcohol. Now, they must close between 6 and 7 a.m. Saturdays.<ep>
   Under the proposed ordinance, businesses could remain open between those hours on Saturdays, paving the way for 24-hour service.<ep>
   Vice Mayor Karen Janzer, who proposed the ordinance change, said the 6 a.m. closing time is causing business owners to lose patrons.<ep>
   ``All their business is shooting over to Hallandale, and then when our businesses reopen, people don't come back,'' Janzer said.<ep>
   In 1994, Hallandale city commissioners approved 24-hour operations at nightclubs, and last year renewed licenses for six establishments.<ep>
   Cafe Casablanca, 100 Ansin Blvd., one block east of Interstate 95, is open until 8 a.m. Saturdays. Ocean's 11 South Lounge, 800 N. Federal Hwy., opens at 11 a.m. Friday and stays open until 6 a.m. Tuesday.<ep>
   A few Pembroke Park establishments have expressed interest in the lengthened hours, including Casey's Nickelodeon, 5590 W. Hallandale Beach Blvd. It now closes at 6 a.m. Saturdays.<ep>
   Despite reports of drunkenness and fights at some of the after-hours clubs in Hallandale, that city's commissioners voted unanimously to approve the late-closing licenses.<ep>
   Janzer said she doesn't expect similar problems in Pembroke Park if the ordinance is amended.<ep>
   ``I don't think it will make a bit of difference for us, but it will help the businesses,'' she said. ``And there are some things we can do if there are problems, like limiting outdoor [waiting] lines to 40 people,'' at establishments such as Zippers, a nightclub one block west of Interstate 95.<ep>
   Pembroke Park commissioners approved the amendment on first reading. After a 7:15 p.m. public hearing on Wednesday, they will vote again. If it passes, a motion can be made for a third and final reading, also on Wednesday. If that passes, the amended ordinance will be official.<ep>
   Town Hall is at 3150 SW 52nd Ave. The Town Commission meeting is at 7 p.m. Wednesday.<ql>
