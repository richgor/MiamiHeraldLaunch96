or Kaneisha Major, it was the conjugated verbs in espa&ntilde;ol that made her lose interest. For Omar Santana, French just wasn't foreign enough.<P>

   Fifth-graders at Watkins Elementary School in Hollywood, Kaneisha and Omar are among a growing number of Broward County students who are choosing the exotic route when it comes to languages. Instead of French and Spanish, they are studying the language of Sony and Mitsubishi -- Japanese.<P>

   ``It's more of a challenge,'' said 11-year-old Kaneisha, who took Spanish for two years before enrolling in Japanese, which is part of Watkins' communications and language magnet program.<P>

   While Spanish and French are immediately legible and sometimes pronounceable with not much difficulty, Japanese is not. Instead of letters, words and sentences are written with symbols.<P>

   ``You have to practice and memorize a lot,'' said William Perez, 12, also in fifth grade. ``You don't write across. You have to write up and down and from right to left.''<P>

   Beginning class each day with a bow and the Japanese word for good afternoon, konnichiwa, the students aren't just learning how to speak. They are also learning about Japan's culture and tradition. Their small portable classroom is decorated with symbols of Japan -- the white flag with its big red dot in the center, the picture of a woman wearing a kimono and the hand fans plastered on the walls.<P>

   ``The best part is the origami,'' said fourth-grader Robert Diaz, describing the art form that involves creating things out of folded paper.<P>

   Like a handful of his classmates, Robert, 10, has become so skilled with the language that he was selected by his teacher, Mitsuko Oyama, to take part in a language competition later this month.<P>

   ``One day I hope to go to Japan and work,'' said Robert, who said he practices Japanese for about 30 minutes a day at home.<P>

   Unsure what to expect when she accepted the job of teaching 250 kindergartners through fifth-graders Japanese, Oyama said she has been very impressed by Robert and the others. Not only has she been amazed by their motivation, but also their pronunciation, she said.<P>

   ``They are doing very well. Better than I expected,'' Oyama said.<P>

   While the Watkins students are in their first year, the school district began offering Japanese as a foreign language for middle and high school students five years ago. The program was expanded to the elementary school two years ago.<P>

   ``We felt that Japanese would be a good language and culture for the children to understand,'' said Diane Carr, director of the magnet program for Broward schools. ``The United States' relationship with Japan is becoming more intricate and involved and we wanted these kids to have an opportunity to participate in that.''<P>

   The 820 students learning Japanese countywide are doing so at the following schools: Sanders Park Elementary in Pompano Beach, Thurgood Marshall Elementary in Fort Lauderdale, McNicol Middle in Hollywood and Crystal Lake Middle in Pompano Beach and Hallandale and Deerfield Beach high schools.<P>

   ``It's fun,'' said Lincoln Borda, 9, a fourth-grader. ``By learning Japanese, I can do another kind of work. I feel special.''
