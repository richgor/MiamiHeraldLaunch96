<m0>roward Community College is garnering its share of awards as the school year nears its end.<ep>
   Mary Jo Henderson, adviser for the school's Phi Theta Kappa chapters, was named one of the top 10 advisers by the academic fraternity during its international convention April 20 in Washington, D.C.<ep>
   Henderson supervises the Phi Theta Kappa chapters at BCC's Pembroke Pines, Davie and Coconut Creek campuses.<ep>
   The three chapters received a five-star rating for excellence in scholarship, leadership, service and fellowship, Henderson said.<ep>
   This was the second year the South Campus chapter in Pembroke Pines received a five-star rating. The chapter has about 200 members.<ep>
   Henderson said the students were recognized for their work with high school students at risk of quitting school.<ep>
  BCC students mentor the high-schoolers by taking them horseback riding every other weekend.<ep>
  ``It gives the high school students a good experience and raises their self-esteem,'' Henderson said.<ep>
   The Central Campus chapter in Davie was named the top Phi Theta Kappa chapter in the state and was listed as one of the top eight chapters in the world for service during the fraternity's international convention in April, Henderson said.<ep>
    Students in the Central Campus chapter organized a program in which BCC students in Phi Theta Kappa take children from Kids in Distress in Wilton Manors on outings, such as picnics or canoeing, two weekends a month.<ep>
   Other honors from this year:<ep>
   (box) The Brain Bowl team won second place in the state Brain Bowl competition March 15 in Ocala.<ep>
