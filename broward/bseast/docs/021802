<m0>f you get a parking ticket in Pembroke Park, it's going to cost you more.<ep>
   Parking violators now will have to pay as much as $250 for certain violations. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Town commissioners voted Wednesday to beef up the fines. ``Basically, they were lower than most other cities,'' said Beverly Raddatz, deputy town clerk.<ep>
   Under the new ordinance, which took effect immediately, fines that were $10 (--) such as parking in restricted or prohibited areas (--) climbed to $25. A $15 ticket for parking hazardously, such as too close to a crosswalk, rose to $25.<ep>
   Parking in a fire zone now costs $50 instead of $25. The biggest fine, for parking in a place reserved for handicapped or disabled drivers, is now $250, up from $100.<ep>
   Raddatz said the time was right to increase the fines. Broward Sheriff's Office District 1, which provides police service to Pembroke Park, is running out of traffic tickets. New ones (--) with the steeper fines (--) are being printed.<ql>
