<m0>olbert Elementary School<m0> has taken its integrated arts curriculum on the road.<ep>
   Students' art projects, which reflect the program's curriculum, are on display this month <m1> <m0>at the Museum of Discovery & Science in Fort Lauderdale and the Hollywood Art and Culture Center in Hollywood.<ep>
   <m0>Sara Marc, <m0>the Hollywood school's art teacher, said students displayed their art at the Hollywood center last year, but this is the first time at the museum in Fort Lauderdale.<ep>
   The science museum was interested in Colbert's program because Marc integrates science in students' art curriculum as part of the school's math and science magnet program.<ep>
   ``Children learn the same themes in art as they learn in science,'' she said.<ep>
   Marc and her students are excited about exhibiting their work at the Fort Lauderdale museum.<ep>
   ``It's a big museum,'' Marc said.<ep>
   The exhibit is called <m0>Integration of Art & Science <m0>and explores iteration, template, code and balance.<ep>
   Iteration means to repeat. Code is a set of signals for sending messages. A template is a pattern for making an exact copy and balance is the harmonious proportion of elements in a design.<ep>
   The exhibit, on the museum's second floor, uses art to explore these elements and how they relate to the different ways children learn, Marc said.<ep>
   ``Children are bombarded with information on all different levels,'' she said.<ep>
   The exhibit shows how students learn codes from life experiences. For example, a traffic light is code: Red means stop. Green means go. Students learn that simple code from riding in a car.<ep>
   Students reflect codes, iteration, template and balance in their art, which includes 3-dimensional projects, drawings, paintings and written material.<ep>
   Colbert's exhibit at the museum is an expanded version from the display at the Hollywood center, Marc said.<ql>
