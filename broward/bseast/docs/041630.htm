he Nativity School baseball team (ages 12 to 14) won the South Division of the All Broward Catholic Conference and advanced into the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season.<P>

   The Knights, based in Hollywood, went 10-0 during the regular season. They defeated Annunciation, St. Bartholomew, St. Bernadette's, Little Flower and St. Steven's to place first in the division and earn a berth in the post season.<P>

   Coach Dennis Adler's Knights dominated the South Division, amassing a 60-0 record the past six regular seasons.<P>

   Last season the Knights cruised in the playoffs, winning the league title. This season, they lost, 8-4, to St. Elizabeth's from Pompano Beach in the county semifinal on Tuesday. In relief, Travis Atria pitched well. He also picked off a runner and had an RBI infield hit.<P>

   The playoff game went just 4 1/2 innings because of a time limit enforced by North Broward Park. Usually, the teams play seven inning games.<P>

   ``We were a little disappointed we didn't get to play the whole game,'' Adler said, ``but we did our best.''<P>

   Adler added: ``It was a great season. We were ecstatic to go this far. No starters returned from last year's championship team, and it was supposed to be a rebuilding year.''<P>

   The team consists of Atria, Ryan Burcel, Frank Butera, Mike Ciriago, Miguel Coder, Arniel Crescenzo, Scott Foresman, Tom Foresman, Jarrod Labasco, Mike Mirto, Joe Rohan, Eric Sonnabend, Mike Tonetti and David Vizcaino.<P>

   The Knights lose just four starters from this season's team.<P>

   ``We should be dynamite next year,'' Adler said.<BR>

   Weston Hills Country Club reached the title game with a 1-0 overtime victory over Danny's Great Bear Automotive. Allison Landes scored the winning goal.<P>
