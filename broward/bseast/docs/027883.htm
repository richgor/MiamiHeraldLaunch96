he Hot Shots twice came from behind to tie the Pasadena Lakes Marlins at eight in a Hollywood Hills Khoury League Juvenile Division (ages 13 and 14) baseball game April 20 at Rotary Park.<P>

   Trailing 7-3 in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Hot Shots scored four times to send the game into an extra inning. John Kiddy and D.J. Noble each hit a double to ignite the rally, and Nicklaus Atria scored the tying run.<P>

   Behind 7-2 in the sixth inning, Travis Atria had a key RBI triple. Down 8-7 in the bottom of the eighth, Kiddy tied the game again, and that's the way it ended.<P>

   Ismael Miranda, a first-year player, caught four fly balls in center field to spark the defense. Noble hit two doubles and scored twice, and pitcher Joey Giordano allowed two runs, walked none and struck out four in five innings.<P>

   <LI> In the Atom Division (ages 7 and 8), Stumpo's Stompers continued their hold of first place with a 5-3 victory over Horizon Maintenance Cardinals April 22. The Stompers have an impressive 14-0-1 record.<P>

   Luis Rivas was the winning pitcher, and James Martinez got the save. Pitching is a strong point of the Stompers. Joining Martinez and Rivas on the pitching staff are Michael Kananskie, Steven Letteri, Robert McManus and Mark Stumpo. A clean-up hitter, Stumpo also leads the team in home runs with 11.<P>

   <LI> The Lil' Bones, sponsored by chiropractor Mike Joffe, played well in a 5-2 setback to the Cardinals April 19. Jose Cruz and Jordan Robbins each scored a run, and C.J. Manning had a hit. Starting pitcher Daniel Mirtenbaum struck out four, walked just one and caught a popup in three solid innings. Pitcher Todd Laird performed admirably in relief.<BR>
   The River Rats defeated the Vipers, 4-1, to win the championship in the Senior Division (ages 13 and older) at Sunrise Ice Skating Center April 12. Michael Arnel scored two goals, and Vince Grenier and Scott Wondrely had one goal apiece. Greg Waxman scored the Vipers' lone goal.<P>

   <LI> The Bulls placed third with an exciting 6-5 victory over the Wolverines. Mike Gagnon led the Bulls with three goals. Jeff Grayboyes added two, and Matt Marcoux scored one. For the Wolverines, James Ryder scored twice, and Khoung Phan, Josh Rimer and Matt Swerdlow each had one goal.<BR>
   Goalie Jonathan Thompson kept Hollywood in the game during a 7-3 defeat to visiting West Pembroke Pines Optimist April 28 at Jefferson Park. Chris Leptien, William Panter and Craig Williams scored for Hollywood, ages 11 and younger.<BR>
   The Greater Hollywood YMCA sponsors its annual t-ball program for boys and girls, ages 4 to 8, at its facility, 3161 Taft St.<P>
