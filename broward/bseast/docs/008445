<m0>nstead of trekking across town to City Hall to pay a utility bill or apply for a parking permit, West Hollywood residents soon will be able to do these things (--) and more (--) right in their neighborhood.<ep>
   City commissioners last week gave preliminary approval to plans for a citizen service center in West Hollywood.<ep>
   The center, which is expected to open in about six months, will be at the northeast corner of Taft Street and North 62nd Avenue.<ep>
   ``This gives us an opportunity to have an alternative to City Hall,'' City Manager Sam Finz said. ``It gives us a presence in the community, so the citizens know the city is there and available.''<ep>
   It also gives the city the chance to use a piece of property that had become a $4 million white elephant. The property is the site of a sewage pump station built in the 1970s that has never worked.<ep>
   The cost of renovating the property, plus making improvements to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, is expected to be $88,140. The majority of the funds will come from the sale of two pieces of surplus property owned by the city.<ep>
   The new service center will be staffed without hiring any additional employees. Employees from police, code enforcement, human resources and citizen assistance will be assigned to the new center.<ep>
   West Hollywood residents are excited about the prospect of having more city services available in their neighborhood.<ep>
   ``I think it will do a lot to unify the city and show voters west of U.S. 441 that we haven't been forgotten,'' said Paul Eckley, secretary of the Driftwood Civic Association and a 10-year resident of the area. ``For too many people, City Hall is a place that is a long way off and is out of touch with the residents out here.''<ep>
   Hollywood officials say this is just the beginning of their plans.<ep>
   ``We hope this is the first of more satellite service centers in the future,'' said George Keller, the city's director of development administration. ``We want to be a part of the neighborhood. This is a way of reaching out and connecting with the community.''<ql>
