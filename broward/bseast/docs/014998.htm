<H2>Stirling's Earth Day activities offer lessons on environment</H2>

E<BR>
arth Day will be celebrated a little late this year at Stirling Elementary School, but students will still learn valuable lessons about what they can do to help preserve the environment.<P>

 The Hollywood school has arranged for speakers to talk to kids in kindergarten through fifth grade about being sensitive to the environment.<P>

 The program started Wednesday, when fifth-graders heard Michael Heimbach talk about recycling programs for the county and Broward public schools.<P>

 He challenged the fifth-graders to develop a recycling program for their school.<P>

 On May 13, third-graders will hear from Hollywood resident Debra Smiley, who is Mrs. Florida US 1995.<P>

 Smiley, an environmentalist and attorney, will present a program about the environment.<P>

 Students will learn about the effects of pesticides and how to buy products made from recycled materials.<P>

 Fourth-graders will hear from Hollywood recycling coordinator Laurie Mertens on May 13.<P>

 Kindergarten and first-graders that day will learn the importance of throwing trash in its proper place by reading the book The Berenstain Bears Don't Pollute (Anymore).<BR>
   Students at Maimonides Academy tested their knowledge of the city of Jerusalem April 24 as part of their celebration of Israel Independence Day.<P>

 The Hollywood school organized a carnival with kids in first through seventh grade creating the game booths, parent Haya Tepper said.<P>

 Rather than buy tickets to play a game, students had to answer questions related to Jerusalem, in recognition of the city's 3,000th anniversary.<P>

   The carnival also featured a haunted house where students had to search for oil for the Hanukkah menorah, Tepper said.<P>

 She said students enjoyed making the carnival booths this year.<P>

 ``It gave them a real feeling of being responsible for the carnival,'' Tepper said.<BR>
   Creative Beginnings Preschool is living up to its name by pursuing its goal to become nationally accredited.<P>

 The Hollywood preschool is sending a group of its parents on a shopping spree May 18 to purchase new toys and supplies for the school.<P>

 Beverly Angelotti, the preschool's owner and director, also decided to add a bit of competition to the activity by seeing which parents could pick the toys out fastest at the store.<P>

 ``I'm going to say, `Here's your list. You have 20 minutes. Ready, set, go!' '' Angelotti said. ``The parents are into this competition thing, so I know they're going to like it.''<P>

 Buying the toys and supplies is part of the school's effort to become accredited by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs in Washington, D.C.<P>

 Angelotti said the accreditation will assure parents that the preschool provides a high-quality program for young children.<P>

   The accreditation process has involved a survey of parents and teachers about their views of the school's curriculum and care of the preschool's 100 children, who range in age from infants to 5.<P>

 Once the school has met the academy's guidelines, the academy will send a team of educators to observe the school to confirm the findings in Creative Beginnings' application.<P>

 Angelotti said she hopes the preschool will receive accreditation by the end of June.<P>

 Parents raised $4,000 through a candy and rummage sale in March to buy additional toys and supplies required for the accreditation.<P>

 The academy requires that the preschool provide the same age-appropriate toy for each child in the class.<P>

 Because parents raised the money, Angelotti decided the parents should be involved in spending it.<BR>
