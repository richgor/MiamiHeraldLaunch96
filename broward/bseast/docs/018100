<m0>he may be the second vice president of the American Business Women's Association, the chair-elect of the Women's Chamber of Commerce and a speaker at workshops on women's financial management. But don't call Judy Dolan a feminist.<ep>
   ``It depends on what the definition is,'' Dolan conceded. ``If it means that I support other women in business and lend a helping hand, then I'm a feminist.''<ep>
   When she isn't volunteering to help women succeed in business, the 30-year-old Pembroke Pines attorney is working, attending to the Miramar law practice she owns.<ep>
   ``She's involved in so many things,'' said Iris Krysty, a member of the ABWA and the owner of Ambassador Funding. ``She's just terrific.''<ep>
   Between litigating cases and participating in other activities, such as sitting on an advisory board at Broward Community College and speaking to churches and civic organizations about estate planning, Dolan often finds herself working between 12 and 15 hours a day.<ep>
   ``I'm not going to say it's easy running my own business and belonging to all these organizations,'' Dolan said. ``But I like the challenge.''<ql>
<m0>A varied perspective<ep>
<m0>   Part of what inspires Dolan to spread her time so thin is the perspective she gets from each of the organizations to which she belongs.<ep>
   Dolan was a charter member of the American Business Woman's Association, which was founded in June 1994 with 35 members. With a current membership of about 120, the organization is geared toward ``anybody who's over 18 and employed,'' Dolan said.<ep>
   ``It gives you a different perspective on business and on life,'' she said.<ep>
   Hairdressers, teachers and Drug Enforcement Administration workers are among those who voted Dolan 1995 Member of the Year and 1996 Woman of the Year.<ep>
   ``I have a great deal of admiration for her,'' said Heidi Richards, founding president of ABWA and owner of Eden Florist and Gift Baskets in Miramar. ``She's very good at just about everything. And when she makes a commitment, she always follows through.''<ep>
   Dolan was one of three women who founded the Women's Chamber of Commerce of Broward County, an organization devoted to professional women, in March.<ql>
<m0>Chance to network<ep>
<m0>   In addition to addressing issues such as applying for minority status with the county and running a home-based business, the Women's Chamber also provides networking opportunities for Broward County businesswomen.<ep>
   ``We founded it to help them in their businesses,'' she said. ``Hopefully, we can grow from it, too.''<ep>
   Dolan, who graduated from University of Miami Law School in 1992, had a successful woman role model while she was growing up in South New Jersey (--) her mother.<ep>
   Joni Dolan, a retired real estate agent, has since moved to Florida with Judy's father Jim, a retired carpenter. ``I spend as much time with my parents as I can,'' Judy Dolan said. ``They encouraged us and stood behind us 100 percent.''<ep>
   The senior Dolans now live around the corner from the house Judy shares with her husband of three years, metal fabricator Ralph Sileo, and their cat, Bud.<ep>
   When Dolan isn't working, which isn't often, she devotes her energies to her husband and family. Though she's content constantly juggling her time, there is one thing she's hoping for.<ep>
   ``I'd like to take a vacation,'' she said. ``It would be sort of nice to just get away.''<ep>
