   Every year, the Florida Department of Education compiles vital statistics for each school in the state and prepares a Florida School Report. The following is information gathered during the 1994-95 school year, the latest year available. Like a family photograph, it's an interesting look at what your school is like. Each school has a detailed copy of its Florida School Report. Hometown Herald will highlight other schools in the coming weeks.<ep>
