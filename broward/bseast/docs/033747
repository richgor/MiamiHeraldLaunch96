<m0>igher membership fees and better fairways are part of an ambitious plan to turn Pembroke Lakes Golf and Country Club into one of South Florida's premier municipal golf courses.<ep>
   PCM, the consultant hired by Pembroke Pines to run the club through September, presented a plan Monday to nearly 150 club members and city residents that calls for adding a pro shop and aggressive marketing.<ep>
   The strategy hinges on raising membership rates to make the course competitive with other golf courses in the city and to generate revenues.<ep>
   ``We need to turn the image of this facility around,'' said Johnny LaPonzina, president of PCM and one of the original co-developers of the Pembroke Pines course.<ep>
   The city is paying LaPonzina, who took over the course last month, $3,000 a month to maintain the 18-hole course at 10500 Taft St. and find ways to make money.<ep>
   The course has been mired in debt since the city bought it in 1983 from LaPonzina and his partners. The city has lost $3.1 million since taking it over, and lost $653,000 last year alone. <m1><ep>
<m0>   The city borrowed $3 million from its general fund to pay off the debt, but still owes $3.3 million on the bond issued to buy it.<ep>
   LaPonzina says he needs golfers to help dig the course out of the red. Members need to be committed to pay higher membership fees, bring friends to play at the course and be vocal about their ideas to improve service, he said.<ep>
   Nearby homeowners also will be asked to keep an eye out for vandals. LaPonzina said the city has spent thousands annually to repair damage caused by vandalism.<ep>
   ``It's your facility. It's your back yard. We would ask residents who live around the golf course to care for their asset,'' LaPonzina said.<ep>
   Some golfers already see a change in the course since LaPonzina took over. Golf crews have trimmed trees, raked bunkers and fertilized fairways, said golfer Chris Copeland.<ep>
   ``It's much better now,'' Copeland said, who vowed to pay higher membership fees if LaPonzina follows through on his promises.<ql>
