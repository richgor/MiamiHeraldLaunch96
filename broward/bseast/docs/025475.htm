I<BR>
n its 40-year history, Temple Beth El has had three rabbis. But that number is expected to change this summer.<P>

  Members of the Reform congregation in Hollywood are making preparations to replace Rabbi Norman Lipson, who will be leaving his post in mid-June.<P>

  Lipson, 50, announced his departure during Shabbat services on April 29. He will begin work on July 1 at a Reform synagogue forming in Weston.<P>

  Lipson joined Temple Beth El in 1990. He was hired to take the place of Rabbi Samuel Jaffe, who had served the synagogue for 32 years.<P>

  Although Lipson's announcement caught the congregation at Temple Beth El by surprise, members have accepted his decision. They are moving forward, said Karen Mintz Margulies, synagogue president.<P>

  ``We wish Rabbi Lipson well,'' she said. ``We're not in an unusual situation. Rabbis come and rabbis go at synagogues all across the country. We'll be just fine.''<P>

  Temple Beth El's board of directors is taking steps to find a new spiritual leader by establishing a search committee, she said.<BR>
  To find candidates, they intend to place a notice with the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the national arm of the Reform movement, Margulies said.<P>

  ``We expect to have an interim rabbi by the time Rabbi Lipson leaves,'' she said. ``We're going to take our time finding a permanent replacement, however. We have no need to rush the process. Everything has already been put in place to ensure a smooth transition.''<P>

  The new rabbi most likely will be someone who will help further the congregation's growth and be sensitive to the needs of both its young families and retirees, said David Mankuta, immediate past president of Temple Beth El.<P>

  Over the past several years, the synagogue at 1351 S. 14th Ave. has been in transition. Throughout the 1980s and early '90s, the congregation was suffering the same fate that had befallen many houses of worship in Broward's eastern communities.<BR>
  Retirees made up the majority of members at these religious institutions. The young families that once filled the pews had packed up and moved to new housing developments out west.<P>

  At Temple Beth El, the migration caused the preschool to shut down and the religious school was facing dwindling enrollment, said Mankuta, a Hollywood lawyer who has been a member of the synagogue for 20 years.<P>

  Lipson arrived just as the synagogue's leaders were starting a revitalization program. The congregation now has 500 families, 50 percent of them young professionals with children, Mankuta said.<P>

  ``Back in the early 1990s, we had around 15 percent young families,'' he said. ``Our ratios have really turned around since then.''<P>

  The resurgence has created a thriving religious school with 150 students. Six years ago, there were 30 to 40 students, he said.<P>

  The preschool, which re-opened its doors two years ago, also has been successful. It currently has an enrollment of 59 children, Mankuta said.<P>

  ``The new rabbi will find that we are a very lively, well-rounded congregation,'' said Margulies, a full-time volunteer who lives in Hollywood and has been a member for 15 years.<BR>
  The incoming rabbi also will find that he or she won't have any neighboring competition. Temple Beth El is the only Jewish congregation in eastern Hollywood.<P>

  Temple Sinai, a Conservative synagogue, once had services nearby but moved two years ago. The congregation now is based at the former site of Temple Beth Shalom at 1400 N. 46th Ave. in Hollywood.<P>

  Lipson said he feels comfortable leaving the synagogue and is looking forward to the challenges of heading the new congregation in Weston. He thinks that his departure is a good opportunity for Temple Beth El.<P>

  ``They are very well equipped to thrive under new leadership,'' he said. ``One of my key issues has been empowerment. I have trained a number of individuals to take over and do things that are necessary to see to the spiritual needs of the members.''
