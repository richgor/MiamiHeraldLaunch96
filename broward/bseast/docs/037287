<m1> <m0>wrecked, partially submerged, 57-foot cabin cruiser that had floated in the Intracoastal Waterway since Oct. 1 is gone.<ep>
   State and local marine officials had said in January that it would take at least eight months to find the money to remove James Schmale's 1947-vintage boat from the Intracoastal near Hallandale Beach Boulevard.<ep>
   A state grant program to pay up to $30,000 for the removal wouldn't consider applications until August, Hallandale officers said.<ep>
   Instead, the state acted sooner. Florida Marine Patrol issued a citation against Schmale, said Capt. Robert E. Rogers, head of the city's road patrol, which also oversees Hallandale's single-boat marine patrol.<ep>
   A Broward County Court judge told Schmale to remove the boat at his own expense within 30 days. Last week, the vessel was removed, Rogers said.<ep>
   All that's left in the water behind Manero's Steakhouse, 2600 E. Hallandale Beach Blvd. (--) the boat's berth for four years (--) is a makeshift foam marker splattered with red spray paint.<ep>
   ``The owner of the boat complied,'' Rogers said. ``He came down with a crane and divers and worked daily for a month and a half.''<ep>
   Schmale, Rogers said, was unemployed and difficult to reach. Calls to his last address in West Palm Beach went unanswered.<ep>
   Hallandale boater Sol Weiner, 70, said he is ecstatic the boat is gone. A regular fisherman, Weiner passed the wrecked cabin cruiser on his way north from his dock at Keystone Point in North Miami.<ep>
   Weiner said he had been frustrated by the news in January that government agencies couldn't act sooner to remove the boat.<ep>
   ``Every group in every department was blaming it on everybody else,'' Weiner said.<ep>
   The boat became partially submerged, Schmale said earlier, because a man broke into the boat on Sept. 19. Schmale said the man cut electrical cords to bilge pumps below deck, causing the boat to founder.<ep>
   Hallandale police arrested George Tyson, a 25-year-old homeless man, on charges of burglary and possessing a sawed-off shotgun.<ep>
   Schmale spent $2,600 trying to salvage the boat before giving up. Soon, chunks of the wooden vessel, furniture and boat parts began drifting down the waterway.<ep>
   Unable to muster the public money to raise the boat, the Coast Guard drained its oil and gas tanks and left it alone.<ql>
