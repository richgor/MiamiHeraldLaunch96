<m0>atrons of Pembroke Park businesses that sell alcoholic beverages now can drink 24 hours on Saturday without having to go to a nearby city.<ep>
   On Wednesday, Pembroke Park town commissioners unanimously approved an ordinance that allows bars, lounges and other establishments that serve alcohol to stay open between 6 and 7 a.m. Saturdays. Before the new ordinance, those businesses had to close during that hour. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Vice Mayor Karen Janzer, who proposed the change for the 1.6-square-mile town, said the old hours caused businesses to lose customers. She said they would leave at the 6 a.m. closing time and go to Hallandale establishments.<ep>
   In 1994, Hallandale city commissioners approved 24-hour operations at businesses serving alcohol, and last year renewed the licenses of six of those businesses.<ep>
   Popular Pembroke Park businesses such as Casey's Nickelodeon, 5590 W. Hallandale Beach Blvd., now stand a better chance of competing with businesses in Hallandale.<ep>
   ``If they approve it, they've got good foresight,'' Casey's Nickelodeon owner Peter Bednarz said before the vote was taken.<ep>
   Bill and Patti LaChance, owners of Chance's Sports Bar, 4426 W. Hallandale Beach Blvd., now have a license to operate with a 6 a.m. Saturday closing time.<ep>
   Though customers (--) mostly from the surrounding neighborhood (--) usually clear out earlier, ``I do think it will help,'' Patti LaChance said. ``There could be less driving [from one establishment to another], and that's safer.''<ql>
