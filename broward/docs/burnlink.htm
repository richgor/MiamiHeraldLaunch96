          <H2> EMERGING FROM SHADOW OF DEATH<BR>
                              BURNED DETECTIVE GOING HOME</H2><BR>

<B> By STEPHEN SMITH</B><BR>
Herald Staff Writer<BR>

 
  <P>    Six months, the doctors murmured to Jim O'Hara.</p>
   <P>   You're going to be stuck in the rehab ward for six months,
 bending fingers that refuse to bend, lifting legs that refuse to
 lift, getting acquainted with a body rendered unfamiliar by the
 ravage of fire.</p>
    <P>  Nah, Jim O'Hara demurred in a voice dimmed from lack of
 use. It won't take half that long.</P>
<P>      Know this: Never bet against Jim O'Hara.</P>
    <P>  "I've learned that I'm a lot stronger than I really thought
 I was," O'Hara said Wednesday, eight months and 16 days after an
 inferno ignited by a madman left him desperately burned. "But to
 be this strong, you've got to have reasons to do it -- my wife
 and my kids are those reasons."</P>
   <P>   So there he was, features muted in an explosion that shook
 a shady suburban street in July. This was the first time the
 Plantation detective had been bathed in the lights of publicity.
 He was the one who'd beckoned the cameras to HealthSouth Sunrise
 Rehabilitation Hospital.</P>
    <P>  And he shared this news: I'm going home, he told the
 reporters and doctors and therapists. Friday, I go home, O'Hara
 said. For good. And it took just eight weeks in the rehab ward.</P>
    <P>  "Doing this kind of work, the human potential is something
 I appreciate more and more," said Mick Rathjens, who runs the
 burn unit at Sunrise Rehab. "But with Jim, I appreciate it more
 than ever."</P>
    <P>  The potential shines brightest when the fangs of pain dig
 deepest. Karl-Henry Gerdes is the physical therapist who has
 spent the most time with O'Hara, 33, stretching arms and fingers
 mottled by fire.</P>
    <P>  "It's something to see him when he's down and tired and
 even then he says, 'Do it to me one more time,' " Gerdes said.
 "He says it even if he's in pain."</P>
    <P>  O'Hara's odyssey of pain began July 25, when he and
 Plantation officer Joe Alu walked into a bedroom where Steve
 Joseph held hostage the two teenage daughters of his estranged
 girlfriend. Joseph lit a bomb brewed with gasoline, incinerating
 himself and the two girls.</P>
    <P>  Alu and O'Hara bore the marks of Joseph's insanity, O'Hara
 worse than Alu. Burns smothered 78 percent of O'Hara's body.</P>
    <P>  "When I was brought outside, I never thought I was going to
 make it," O'Hara said. "I was in a lot of pain then. That was
 really the only time that I can remember being in a lot of
 pain."</P>
    <P>  A helicopter ferried him to Jackson Memorial Hospital,
 where he would spend half a year, with death his constant
 companion, casting a shadow that seemed to swallow the tough guy
 cop they call Rocky.</P>
     <P> The days and weeks and months drifted by in a gauzy haze,
 drugs and pain dulling reality. He didn't know that, at the most
 dire moments, doctors feared that infection would consume him,
 that his organs would fail him.</P>
    <P>     Jim O'Hara knew only this: He had a baby son, born six
 days after the explosion, and he was determined to hold his son,
 to see his crib in the family's Coral Springs home.</P>
    <P>  "And a lot of it had to do with God, wanting to stay alive
 and see my kids, my family," O'Hara said. "It's been a rough
 eight months, but I'm glad to be here."</P>
    <P>  O'Hara, clad in olive green khakis and green paisley shirt,
 was flanked Wednesday by doctors and friends and family. He
 introduced his 3 1/2-year-old daughter Kelsey and infant son
 Brett. "No resemblance," O'Hara said, showing a streak of humor
 that laced through the 21 minutes he spent with media.</P>
     <P> He offered tributes to them all but reserved his most
 profound words for the woman seated to his right, Janine O'Hara.</P>
    <P>  "The person who brought me through this whole thing was my
 wife -- without her I never would have made it," O'Hara said.
 "She's been the strength and foundation of this family.</P>
     <P> "I'm just real happy to be alive and see my kids," the
 detective said, dissolving into tears.</P>
      <P>   He's been seeing more and more of them -- and more of
 the world beyond his hospital bed. In recent weeks, there has
 been a foray to a Jackson Browne concert, a trip to see The
 Birdcage, a night watching the Panthers.</P>
     <P> "He's busier than me," said Gerdes, the physical therapist.
 "He doesn't stick around here."</P>
      <P>That's an essential part of the treatment regimen at
 Sunrise Rehab. The mind must heal along with the body, so trips
 to malls and films are encouraged.</P>
     <P> "You start to become sort of a recluse if you don't go
 out," O'Hara said. "You can't be afraid to go out even though
 your features are remarkably changed."</P>
    <P>  Someone asked O'Hara about the future Wednesday. I'm not
 sure what I want to do with the rest of my life, he said. Maybe
 a return to police work, maybe not.</P>
     <P> For months to come, O'Hara will spend part of every weekday
 at Sunrise Rehab. There's more surgery, too, after surviving
 more than a dozen procedures.</P>
     <P> The therapy, the surgery, those O'Hara can endure. It is,
 he said, the inevitable nuisances of life that try him most.</P>
     <P> "Like, for instance, I got a cold," O'Hara said. "I hated
 having that cold. After all I've been through, it's like, what
 else can happen? What else?"</P>

 after the July 25 explosion that burned 78 percent of the
 Plantation police detective's body. 'I'm just real happy to be
 alive and see my kids,' he said at a news conference announcing
 he's going home Friday.
