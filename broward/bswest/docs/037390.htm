 BROWARD HOMETOWN
<!-- start headlines -->
<H2>Club for computer users formed at BCC's Pembroke Pines campus</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
<B><FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT></B>hen people came to Emilia Guzzardo at Broward Community College in Pembroke Pines for help with their home or work computers, she knew there was a need for a computer club in South Broward.<P>

 ``Retired people just come in and ask for help,'' said Guzzardo, who is secretary for the Office Systems Technology Department at BCC's South Campus. ``We encourage them to take a class.''<P>

 But classes aren't always enough.<P>

 Retirees, BCC students and business people in the community all are looking for help in buying computers, training their staff, or selecting software, Guzzardo said.<P>

 Last November, Guzzardo became coordinator for the Broward Computer Club, which is sponsored by BCC.<P>

 About 200 people showed up for the first meeting, and 140 signed up for the group's mailing list.<P>

 Most of the people were from South Broward, but the club also draws from Miami and Boca Raton.<P>

 The next meeting will be at 6:15 p.m. Wednesday in the Mass Media Room of the South Regional Library, 7300 Pines Blvd., Pembroke Pines.<P>

 Speakers will include Dan Keating, who writes a computer column for The Herald. He will give a hands-on demonstration on how to use the Freenet. Also, Jerrold Rosen, vice president of the Savings of America's Pembroke Pines Branch, will talk about using computers for online banking.<P>

 Guzzardo hopes to recruit officers for the club, which will break for the summer and start meeting monthly again in September.<P>

 Membership is free and open to the public.<P>

 Guzzardo said the club's goal is to develop a resource list of members who can help others with computer problems and sharing information.<P>

 For information about the Broward Computer Club, call Guzzardo at 963-8841.<BR>
Tiger Cubs take a Tumble<P>

   Southwest Broward's youngest members of the Boy Scouts gathered at Robbins Lodge in Davie for a Tiger Tumble.<P>

 More than 100 Tiger Cubs, who are 6 years old and in their first year of Boy Scouts, and their parents participated in the April 27 event.<P>

 The boys made toolboxes, ran an obstacle course and created drums from tin cans, said Jim Border, chairman of the Boy Scouts' Miccosukee District, which includes Pembroke Pines and Miramar.<P>

 Cindy Beasley of Pack 160 at Hawkes Bluff Elementary School in Davie coordinated the event.<P>

 This was the first Tiger Tumble organized by the Miccosukee District, which was formed in January to accommodate the growth in Southwest Broward.<P>

 Anyone interested in volunteering in Boy Scouts or registering their son in Scouts can call 584-4200.<BR>
Submarine training<P>

   Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Shawn Tobin has graduated from the basic enlisted submarine course at the Naval Submarine School in Groton, Conn.<P>

 Tobin, son of Sheela Tobin of Pembroke Pines, graduated in 1993 from St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale. He joined the Navy in 1994.<P>

 During the five-week course, Tobin learned about the operation of nuclear submarines.<BR>
