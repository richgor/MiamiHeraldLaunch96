<B><FONT SIZE=+3></FONT></B>he Pines Baptist Church is moving its office to a building that congregants bought last month.<P>

  The 200-member congregation raised $90,000 in 10 weeks to put a down payment on the property and refurbish it. The office should be up and running by Friday, said the Rev. Steve Nerger, pastor at Pines Baptist.<P>

  The site is slightly larger than the church's old office, which was a 2,000-square-foot rented space inside a shopping center at 9877 Pines Blvd. in Pembroke Pines.<P>

  The recently acquired building, at 120 NW Douglas Rd., is really a 2,400-square-foot home that has been zoned as commercial property, Nerger said.<P>

  Parishioners plan to enlarge the structure by another 1,000 square feet this summer, he said.<P>

  ``We're actually getting more room for less money,'' he said. ``And in the future, we intend to use the property as an asset toward possibly constructing our own worship facility.''<P>

  Until then, the church will continue holding services at 10:30 a.m. Sundays at Pines Middle School, 200 NW Douglas Rd.<P>

  Call 435-8484 for more information. Office hours are 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday.<BR>
Deacon to be ordained<BR>

  Roberto Garza, a deacon at St. Maximilian Kolbe Catholic Church in Pembroke Pines, will be ordained as a priest Saturday.<P>

  The ordination will take place at 10 a.m. at St. Mary's Cathedral, 7525 NW Second Ave. in Miami. Five other deacons will also take part in the ceremony.<P>

  Garza, 28, has been working with parishioners at St. Maximilian Kolbe for the past year.<P>

  As a new priest, Garza will be assigned to St. Mary Star of the Sea Church in Key Biscayne. He will begin serving the parish on June 11.<BR>
Dance performance<BR>
<P>

  Ann Peterson, who runs a dance ministry in the Bahamas, will perform during worship services on Friday and Sunday at World Harvest Ministries, 10777 Pembroke Rd. in Pembroke Pines.<P>

  Service times are 7:30 p.m. Friday and 11 a.m. Sunday.<P>

Jewish singles meeting<BR>
<P>

  A gathering for Jewish singles will take place at 7 p.m. May 19 inside Aish HaTorah's South Florida headquarters, 1055 NE Miami Gardens Dr. in North Miami Beach.<P>

  The meeting is open to men and women age 30 to 49. The topic, to be discussed at a round-table talk format, will be intermarriage.<P>

  Admission is $10 per person. Wine, cheese and desserts will be served.<P>

Trip to Caribbean<BR>
<P>

   Seniors can see the eastern Caribbean islands from a Jewish perspective aboard a special eight-day cruise.<P>

  The trip, which will take place June 2-9, is being sponsored by the Jewish Community Foundation of the Jewish Federation of South Broward and the Foundation of Jewish Philanthropies of the Jewish Federation of Greater Fort Lauderdale.<P>

  Participants will visit Jewish sites of interest in Nassau, San Juan and St. John. There also will be a tour of a 200-year-old synagogue in St. Thomas.<P>

  While on the ship, seniors will be treated to a Shabbat service and dinner. In addition, they will have the opportunity to learn about their Jewish past from scholars in residence.<P>

  Fares for the cruise start at $515 per person, double occupancy. Port tax is extra.<P>

  Call Jerry Cohen at the Jewish Federation of South Broward at 921-8810 between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday.
