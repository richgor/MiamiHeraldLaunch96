<m0>he <m0>Nativity School <m0>baseball team (ages 12 to 14) won the South Division of the All Broward Catholic Conference and advanced into the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season.<ep>
   The Knights, based in Hollywood, went 10-0 during the regular season. They defeated <m0>Annunciation, St. Bartholomew, St. Bernadette's, Little Flower <m0>and <m0>St. Steven's <m0>to place first in the division and earn a berth into the postseason.<ep>
   Coach <m0>Dennis Adler's <m0>Knights have dominated the South Division, amassing a 60-0 record the past six regular seasons.<ep>
   Last season the Knights cruised in the playoffs, winning the league title. This season, they lost, 8-4, to <m0>St. Elizabeth's <m0>from Pompano Beach in the county semifinal on Tuesday. <m1> <m0>In relief, <m0>Travis Atria <m0>pitched well. He also picked off a runner and had an RBI infield hit.<ep>
   The playoff game went just 4 1/2 innings because of a time limit enforced by North Broward Park. Usually, the teams play seven inning games.<ep>
   ``We were a little disappointed we didn't get to play the whole game,'' Adler said, ``but we did our best.''<ep>
   Adler added: ``It was a great season. We were ecstatic to go this far. No starters returned from last year's championship team, and it was supposed to be a rebuilding year.''<ep>
   The team consists of Atria, <m0>Ryan Burcel, Frank Butera, Mike Ciriago, Miguel Coder, Arniel Crescenzo, Scott Foresman, Tom Foresman, Jarrod Labasco, Mike Mirto, Joe Rohan, Eric Sonnabend, Mike Tonetti <m0>and <m0>David Vizcaino.<m0><ep>
   The Knights lose just four starters from this season's team.<ep>
   ``We should be dynamite next year,'' Adler said.<ql>
