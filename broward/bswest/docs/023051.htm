HORSE WITH NO NAME: Pembroke Pines officer Ed Klingman rides a former -- and as yet unrenamed -- racehorse. `The horse draws the niceness out of people,' Klingman says.<BR>
<BR>
`I think it's great because then you don't have to use a car. Horses go faster. Horses can go on the sidewalk and keep on running. Cars have to stop at the red light.'<BR>

icole Sarver, 10, thinks horses can be great partners for police officers.<P>

<BR>
  ``They can still get places, and they don't have to pay for gas,'' she said.<P>

  Nicole, a fourth-grader from Silver Palms Elementary School, has an idea about a perfect name for a police horse -- Chase.<P>

  Thousands of youngsters from Silver Palms, temporarily in Cooper City, and other elementary schools in Pembroke Pines have suggested names for the city's second police horse.<P>

   The horses, which are used for patrols and special events, enjoy people and sometimes bow their heads for youngsters to pet them.<P>

  Ty, a friendly, chestnut-color horse, has been on patrol with officer Terry Burns for about eight years.<P>

  The second horse, a former racehorse, originally had the name Wanna Do It Again.<P>

  But that wasn't a simple police-horse name, Burns said.<P>

  So the officers agreed to let children help decide on a replacement. After the playful brown-and-white horse toured the elementary schools, the youngsters colored drawings and jotted down name ideas.<P>

  The winning name will be chosen by a panel of police officers and officials, and the child who submitted it will be honored May 18 at the Public Safety Department.<P>

  ``They came up with some names that look like they put thought into it,'' Burns said.<P>

  Among the entries were Brownie, Lightning, Cinnamon and Crime Stopper.<P>

  Michael Zambrano, a fourth-grader at Pines Lakes Elementary, suggested Walter because he thinks the name is funny for a horse.<P>

  He said he's glad the department uses horses because they can sneak up on criminals.<P>

  ``They're a better way of transportation and less noisy,'' he said.<P>

  Andi Caban, 7, of Palm Cove Elementary, suggested Michael -- her cousin's name. Her friend, Ashley Perdomo, a kindergartner, suggested Jonathan.<P>

  Andi said she likes the idea of police officers on horseback.<P>

   ``I think it's great because then you don't have to use a car. Horses go faster,'' she said. ``Horses can go on the sidewalk and keep on running. Cars have to stop at the red light.''<P>

   Miriam Eichenbaum, 8, of Pembroke Lakes Elementary School, suggested Brownie because the horse reminded her of a brownie with sugar.<P>

  The advantages of the police horse, Burns said, include a broad field of vision for the officers. Also, a horse can maneuver in certain places -- such as between cars -- that automobiles can't.<P>

  And horses serve as a way for children and others to meet police officers on a friendly, personal level.<P>

  ``The horse draws the niceness out of people,'' said officer Ed Klingman, who patrols with the unnamed horse.<P>

  Burns agreed.<P>

  ``They come up and talk to me so they can pet the horse,'' she said.
