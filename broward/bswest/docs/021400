<m0>roward Community College is garnering its share of awards as the school year nears its end.<ep>
 <m0>Mary Jo Henderson, <m0>adviser for the school's Phi Theta Kappa chapters, was named one of the top 10 advisers by the academic fraternity during its international convention April 20 in Washington, D.C.<ep>
 Henderson supervises the Phi Theta Kappa chapters at BCC's Pembroke Pines, Davie and Coconut Creek campuses.<ep>
 The three chapters received a five-star rating for excellence in scholarship, leadership, service and fellowship, Henderson said.<ep>
 This was the second year the South Campus chapter in Pembroke Pines received a five-star rating. The chapter has approximately 200 members.<ep>
 Henderson said the students were recognized for their work with high school students at risk of quitting school.<ep>
 BCC students mentor the high-schoolers by taking them horseback riding every other weekend.<ep>
 ``It gives the high school students a good experience and raises their self-esteem,'' Henderson said.<ep>
 The Central Campus chapter in Davie was named the top Phi Theta Kappa chapter in the state and was listed as one of the top eight chapters in the world for service during the fraternity's international convention in April, Henderson said.<ep>
    Students in the Central Campus chapter organized a program in which BCC students in Phi Theta Kappa take children from Kids in Distress in Wilton Manors on outings, such as picnics or canoeing, two weekends a month.<ep>
 Other honors from this year:<ep>
 (box) The Brain Bowl team won second place in the state Brain Bowl competition March 15 in Ocala.<ep>
 (box) The Varsity Math team won second place in the Southeast Regional mathematics competition in April at the BCC Central Campus.<ep>

<m1>Cyclists raise money for charity<ep>
<m0>   The Pembroke Pines community helped raise $50,000 for the American Diabetes Association during the fifth annual Tour de Cure benefit bikeathon April 14 at C.B. Smith Park in Pembroke Pines.<ep>
 Some 358 bicyclists rode one of three routes to raise money from pledges for the association.<ep>
 The bicyclists rode either 15 miles, 32 miles or 62 miles in the fund-raiser, said <m0>Bob Callahan, <m0>the association's regional director.<ep>
 This year's event was chaired by <m0>Frank Sacco, <m0>head of Memorial Healthcare System, which includes Memorial Hospital West and Memorial Hospital Pembroke in Pembroke Pines.<ep>
 About 100 volunteers helped organize the bikeathon, which took riders from C.B. Smith Park to routes through Southwest Broward and back to the park.<ep>
 ``We raised almost $10,000 more this year than in past years,'' Callahan said.<ep>
 The event also drew riders from as far away as Naples, he said.<ql>
<m1>Cub Scouts win racing honors<ep>
<m0>   Two Cub Scouts from Pembroke Pines took honors in this year's Miccosukee District Pinewood Derby.<ep>
 Cub Scouts from throughout West Broward competed by racing the wooden cars they made themselves.<ep>
 In the Webelos 1 Division for fourth-graders, <m0>Patrick Vicens<m0> of Cub Scout Pack 460 in Pembroke Pines won first place, and <m0>Erick Ruskin <m0>of Cub Scout Pack 492 in Pembroke Pines took third.<ep>
