<m0>lready frustrated by slow business, shopkeepers on University Drive in Pembroke Pines face another roadblock to building a thriving clientele (--) road construction.<ep>
   Last week, state transportation officials unveiled plans to add turn lanes on both the north and south lanes of University Drive at Taft Street. The plan will give more drivers turn access to Taft Street.<ep>
   Merchants are viewing with caution this final version of the $300,000 project planned for 1997-98. They fear the construction work and its final result will further drive away business.<ep>
   The plan calls for closing the median on University Drive north of Taft Street across from Freddie's Plaza and prohibiting northbound turns from the median south of Taft on University.<ep>
   Merchants worry that drivers heading north on the road won't be able to easily turn into the shops on the west side of University Drive.<ep>
   ``The median cuts will cut off customers on the east side of University going to the west,'' said Art Goldsmith, owner of Renee's Golden Touch, a jewelry store on the west side of University Drive just north of Northwest 15th Court.<ep>
   Even city officials worried the plans would harm businesses already struggling to stay open.<ep>
   ``Those people are suffering already,'' said City Engineer Taj Siddiqui. ``DOT thinks they are gods.''<ep>
   Both the city and the store owners propose leaving the median cuts open and building the additional lanes by using some of the land along the canal on the east side of University Drive.<ep>
   Goldsmith says this scenario leaves the medians open to drivers heading north who want to go to his and dozens of other businesses on the west side of University.<ep>
   But what works for shopkeepers won't necessarily be the best way to make the road safe, said Freddie Vargas, assistant district traffic operations engineer for the Florida Department of Transportation.<ep>
   Vargas says the intersection of Taft and University is on the list of the most dangerous in the county. From 1990-92, the state shows 103 accidents.<ep>
   ``We want to explain what we are doing and how the movements can occur,'' he said. ``We want to provide a safer location. I don't think anyone can argue against safety.''<ep>
   Vargas said the state will be willing to hold more public meetings to discuss construction plans.<ql>
