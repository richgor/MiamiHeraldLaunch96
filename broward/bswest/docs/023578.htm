<B><FONT SIZE=+3>P</FONT></B>embroke Pines' anniversary celebration wouldn't have been complete without a Hometown Bakeoff contest. Last Sunday, the sixth annual event was held as part of the city's two-day 36th birthday party at the Pines Recreation Center.<P>

   Twenty-six people entered the competition, and 10 of them came away winners. Their homemade cookies, pies, candies and cakes were judged by Phil Chimento, of Austin's Steakhouse in Pembroke Pines, and Gisela Turrentine, the 1995 best of show winner. Turrentine is now the owner of her own local baking business, the Classic Cheesecake.<P>

   The winners include: Debbie Crum, first place, and Lillan Auricchio, second place, for homemade cookies; Cynthia Hoban, first place, Tammie Cooper, second place and Robin Simon, third place, for homemade pies; Ashley Schwartz, 10, first place, for homemade candy; Donna Reuth, first place, Fran Hunt, second place and Donna Baldwin, third place, for homemade cakes; and Lourdes Schatzberg for best of show.<P>

   Here's Schatzberg's Mocha Birthday Cake recipe, as well as two of the other winning recipes:<BR>
 BEST OF SHOW <BR>
<BR>

Lourdes Schatzberg's<BR>
Mocha Birthday Cake<BR>
Cake<BR>
     2 1/3 cups sugar<P>

   2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour<P>

   1 2/3 cup cocoa powder<P>

   2 teaspoons baking powder<P>

   1 teaspoon baking soda<P>

   1/2 teaspoon salt<P>

   3 large eggs, separated<P>

   2 1/4 cups water<P>

   2/3 cup vegetable oil<P>

   2 teaspoons vanilla<P>

   1/4 cup sour cream<BR>
Frosting<BR>
     2 pounds 10x powdered sugar<P>

   4 cups Crisco All-Vegetable Shortening<P>

   4 teaspoons Taster's Choice Blend instant freeze<P>

     Dried Coffee, diluted in half a cup of regular milk.<P>

   4 ounces brewed espresso coffee -- save for later<BR>
   Grease three nine-inch pans with Crisco shortening, line the bottoms with wax paper and dust lightly with flour. Separate eggs and beat egg whites at high speed while adding 1/3 cup of sugar until meringue forms; save for later. In another mixing bowl sift all dry ingredients, add egg yolks, water, sour cream and vanilla. Mix slowly, scraping the sides of the bowl. After all ingredients are incorporated, mix at high speed for five minutes. Fold in egg whites by hand gently until well mixed. Place in greased pans and bake for 25 to 30 minutes at 325 degrees. Let cake cool for five minutes before removing from pans. Cakes must cool completely before frosting.<P>

   In a separate mixing bowl, place all the frosting ingredients and mix at high speed for five minutes, being sure all shortening is well mixed. Refrigerate until needed.<P>

   Assemble cake by placing one layer on a serving platter, moisten with espresso coffee and spread frosting on top, continue with remaining layers. Frost all around the outside of cake.<BR>
 PIES <BR>
<BR>

Cynthia Hoban's<BR>
Grandma's Apple Pie<BR>
Crust<BR>
   2 cups all-purpose flour<P>

   1 teaspoon salt<P>

   2/3 cup Crisco<P>

   4 tablespoons water<BR>
   Mix well and roll out on floured pastry board. Fold and put in 9-inch greased pie plate.<BR>
Pie filling<BR>
3 lbs. apples<P>

   1 cup of sugar<P>

   2 tablespoons cinnamon<P>

   1 stick butter<BR>
   Pare and slice apples into pie plate. Sprinkle sugar over apples. Sprinkle cinnamon over sugar. Put butter on top. Put top crust on pie and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.<BR>
<BR>
 COOKIES <BR>
<BR>

Debbie Crum's<BR>
Peanut Butter Surprise Cookies<BR>
<BR>
   Ritz Crackers<P>

     Borden vanilla candy coating<P>

     Peanut butter<P>

     Hershey's mini chocolate chips<BR>
<BR>
   Spread 1 teaspoon peanut butter on each of 50 Ritz crackers. Top each with a second cracker. Melt Borden candy coating over lowest possible heat, stirring constantly. When melted, remove from heat. Dip each cracker/peanut butter sandwich into candy coating. (This is most easily done by holding it on a toothpick.) Allow excess coating to drip back into pan. Place on wax paper-lined cookie sheets to cool. When cool, place mini chocolate chips onto center of cookie.
