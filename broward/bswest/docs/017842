<m0>fter hearing from angry residents who don't want a used-car lot in their neighborhood, Miramar city commissioners last week postponed a vote to rezone 37 acres in the Huntington area.<ep>
   Vice Mayor Marjorie Conlan directed AutoNation USA to come to the May 15 City Commission meeting with studies showing how traffic in the entire area would be affected by the business.<ep>
   ``I really do feel this affects the health, safety and welfare of the residents,'' Conlan said.<ep>
   AutoNation USA, a chain of mega-used-car lots being started by H. Wayne Huizenga, wants to open a 27-acre lot north of Miramar Parkway and east of Interstate 75. In addition to land rezoning, the company must also receive a conditional use from the City Commission.<ep>
   Jaye Epstein, city community development director, recommended the commission approve the rezoning, saying it falls into an approved use for the city's new land development code. The rezoning would allow ``light industrial'' (--) a mix of industrial and commercial businesses.<ep>
   But residents said they were told when they bought their homes that stores and office buildings (--) not industrial businesses (--) would be built on the site.<ep>
   ``We have brochures that show `commercial and office buildings' would be built on that site,'' said Sandy Enos, who has organized the protests.<ep>
   Said Epstein: ``The city is not liable for presentations made by private parties.''<ep>
   More than a dozen residents showed up at the meeting to protest the rezoning (--) far fewer than the 200 who showed up at a planning and zoning board meeting on the issue. Enos said more will show up if the City Commission votes on the final step, the conditional use.<ep>
   Huntington resident Nora Jacome presented commissioners with a list of what residents want at the location: a supermarket, pharmacies, restaurants, a doctor's office or bank, to name a few.<ep>
   Residents also said they were fearful of excessive traffic on Miramar Parkway, which is already congested, and 18-wheel trucks barreling down local roads.<ep>
   ``This is irrational, to think they will test drive on I-75,'' Jacome said. ``Where are they going to go? Our neighborhood.''<ep>
   The May 15 commission meeting will begin at 7 p.m. and will be at City Hall, 6700 Miramar Pkwy.<ep>
   In Pembroke Pines, a plan to rezone property for two auto dealerships met with no objections from residents Wednesday.<ep>
   City commissioners there approved a proposal to rezone 6.5 acres on the southeast corner of Pines Boulevard and Douglas Road for an auto dealership. Mike Maroone plans to open a new dealership next to his current auto plaza at 8600 Pines Blvd. They also approved plans for a Driver's Mart, a large used-car dealership planned by Maroone and other auto dealers, at Pines Boulevard and Northwest 136th Avenue.<ql>
