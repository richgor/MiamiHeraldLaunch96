he squeal of brakes and the screech of rubber on asphalt jolted Jo Ann Marino.<P>

   ``That's what I'm talking about!'' she sputtered as two cars narrowly avoided slamming into each other on Sunrise Boulevard and Northwest 118th Avenue in Plantation.<P>

   The near-collision was a frightening illustration of why Marino is fighting for a traffic light at that intersection. Her crusade began Oct. 19, when a car speeding east on Sunrise Boulevard hit Nicola Fraser's car as she headed north across the main road. Fraser, 30, and her son Matthew, 9, died.<P>

   Fraser, of Sunrise, was driving home from church in Plantation Acres when she was killed. Marino was there. ``I ran right over there and tried to talk to her and she was dead,'' Marino said, still haunted by the deaths of a woman and boy she never knew. That's when she began her crusade for the traffic signal.<P>

   In the past six months, Marino has dealt with more government officials than in her entire life. She has written letters, garnered the support of her City Council and preached about the need for that signal to anyone who will listen.<P>

   The county has said there's not enough traffic at the intersection to warrant a signal, said Gary Clough, Plantation's city engineer. In addition, the city must first build right turn lanes on Northwest 118th Avenue so that turning cars wouldn't have to wait for a green light.<P>

   The city is negotiating to buy land for the turn lanes. When the sale is complete, it should take three to four months to finish those lanes. Then the city will ask the county for another traffic study, Clough said.<P>

   In the meantime, Marino tries to avoid the intersection and hopes there are no more accidents there. <P>

   ``I feel like I haven't done enough, but I just don't know what to do,'' she said.<P>

   Northwest 118th Avenue is the main north-south artery in Plantation Acres. It will get even busier when Hiatus Road closes to through-traffic in that area. The county plans to make that change within the next five years as part of a plan to build a wider Hiatus Road farther east.<P>

   And the new Panthers arena is planned just a few miles away, ensuring even more traffic. The intersection now is regulated only by stop signs on Northwest 118th Avenue.<P>

    ``Why wait until you've only added to the problem before you start to address the solution?'' asked Plantation City Council member Rae Carole Armstrong. ``Now's the time to do this and not wait until some mystical numbers in the future say OK.''<P>

   The numbers aren't mysterious, said Dick Smith, assistant director of the Broward County Department of Traffic Engineering.<P>

   Pressure-sensitive hoses across the road tally the daily number of cars. Armed with that information, staffers go out to the intersection and count how many cars turn there. Then officials look at accident reports and figure in those numbers.<P>

   If traffic is too light to warrant a signal, but there have been a lot of accidents at the intersection, officials may decide to install one anyway, Smith said.<P>

   Requests to the Florida Department of Transportation have slowed a bit in the past few years, because most state roads tend to be in the eastern part of the county, where there is less new development.<P>

   ``There aren't a lot of major developments going in at this point in time,'' said Mark Plass, DOT assistant district traffic operations engineer.<P>

   Plass gets about 10 to 20 requests a year. Many of those come from residents along Pines Boulevard, which is a state road all the way out to U.S. 27. As development moves westward, more lights are needed.<P>

   Even in the east, residents can get lights on state roads, though.<P>

   The tiny town of Pembroke Park had the help of some elected state officials in its drive to get a light outside a mobile home park on Hallandale Beach Boulevard.<P>

   The light will be installed this year at the entrance to the Lone Pine West Mobile Home Park at Country Club Lane and Hallandale Beach Boulevard. And the DOT is studying traffic outside a second mobile home park at nearby Green Acres Road.<P>

   Between 10 and 15 new signals are placed on county roads each year. Smith's department studies 30 to 40 intersections in that time.<P>

   ``Usually what happens is that people will start asking for traffic signals at a particular location two to three years before it actually becomes warranted,'' Smith said. When the light doesn't go in, he often gets angry phone calls.<P>

   ``They say, `How many people have to die before you idiots put in a traffic signal?' '' Smith said. ``That's a pretty standard line we get from people.''<P>

   It's a real concern for parents at Seacastle Elementary School in Miramar.<P>

   Practically since the school opened in 1990, they've been trying to get a light installed at the entrance of the school at Miramar Boulevard and Fairmont Avenue. The intersection contains the entrance to the employee parking lot and drop-off area for students. Many pupils also cross at that intersection.<P>

   But the county said there isn't enough traffic outside of the peak arrival and departure times to warrant a light, said Diane Shaviano, a former school advisory chairwoman.<P>

   Shaviano said she sent letters to the county and appeared before the City Commission, pleading for a light during her two-year tenure.<P>

   ``There have been a lot of fender-benders there, but no one has been hurt, and unfortunately, everyone says that's what it takes to get a light,'' Shaviano said.<P>
