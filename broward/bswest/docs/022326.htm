he Hollybrook Men's Golf Club presented a check for $39,718 to Memorial Hospital West during a recent cocktail party at its facility in Pembroke Pines.<P>

   The men's golf club has raised $90,000 over three years through charity golf tournaments. The money will be used for a state-of-the-art cardiac monitoring system.<P>

   Carl Shechter, chairman of the club's charity golf tournament committee, and Henry Seigel, president of the club, handed the check to Zeff Ross, director of Memorial Hospital West.<P>

   The golf tournament, held March 9 at Hollybrook Golf Club, attracted 144 participants, including community business professionals and golf club members.<P>

   ``Hard work by the members of Hollybrook Men's Golf Club makes this work,'' Shechter said. ``It's become one of our major charitable projects of the year. We work on it for five months, beginning in October. There are 24 men on the committee, and our ladies' golf association helps out on the day of the tournament. They're all beautiful, wonderful people.''<P>

   He added: ``Next year, we're looking forward to doing even better.''<BR>

  Century Village of Pembroke Pines men's tennis team tied for second in the 75-and-older group of the Senior Men's Tennis League of Broward County.<P>

   The players received their awards last month during a luncheon at Pine Island Ridge Country Club.<P>

   Members of the team are Al Blocker, Gene Dallo, Barney Goldberg, Alex Greene, co-captain Sam Kassel, Sam Nebesky, captain Hy Marder, Sam Schneider, Dave Singer, Harold Sternberg and Sol Stolber. Kassel and Marder spent a lot of time playing No. 1 doubles.<P>

   ``We love playing,'' Kassel said. ``Most of us are out playing every single day. It gives me a high. I'm not tired. I'm up.''<P>

   He added: ``We're getting better as we get older.''<P>

   Kassel, 77, played for Golden Isles Tennis Club in Hallandale about 10 years ago. He helped lead that team to a second-place finish in the Senior Men's Tennis League, a doubles-only league.<BR>

  Bill Fanizzi, 32, of Fort Lauderdale is taking what he knows and using that to develop young baseball players.<P>

   Fanizzi, a former professional player, is a hitting instructor in Broward County, teaching players age 7 to 23 the proper mechanics and techniques of hitting. He is already instructing 40 youths throughout Broward.<P>

   ``The students are getting such good results,'' Fanizzi said. ``Literally, the parents call me at 10 and 11 at night after games about the progress their kids are making. That's what's most satisfying. I enjoy working with the youngsters.''<P>

   A 1981 Fort Lauderdale High School graduate, Fanizzi played collegiate baseball at the College of Boca Raton -- now named Lynn University -- leading the team in hitting in 1985. This former Herald All-County first-team selection later played for the Miami Marlins, an independent minor league team, and the Brainerd Bears, another independent team in Minnesota.<P>

   Fanizzi, an outfielder, spent two seasons in the Italian League. Last season, he competed for the Omaha Royals, the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals.<P>
