<m1> <m0>capacity audience cheered and applauded as <m0>Chuck Zink <m0>introduced <m0>Minna Boren Collos <m0>at the start of her seventh annual fashion show and luncheon April 27.<ep>
   Moments later they were shocked into silence when Collos announced she was retiring as head of the event, but would continue all her sewing classes. ``It's time for someone else to take over,'' she said. ``Seven years is quite enough.'' The applause started again as she walked down the runway modeling a beautifully tailored pantsuit.<ep>
   Zink, who was commentator for the show, took over introducing each model as she made her appearance, describing in detail the style, fabric and trim of the garment she had designed and sewn.<ep>
   Zink kept the show going smoothly as each model appeared two or three times in different fashions.<ep>
   In between showings, the audience was entertained by soloists <m0>Jerry Gingold, Donna Bopp, Carmen Priven <m0>and <m0>Al Callendar.<m0><ep>
   The models appearing were <m0>Janice Adler, Lillian Baker, Temy Barbach, Evelyn Bienstock, <m0>Collos, <m0>Isabel Cooke, Lee Demerski, Muriel Gelband, Mary Greenburg, Rhoda Jacobs <m0>and <m0>Roslyn Lieberman.<m0><ep>
   Also, <m0>Lorraine Matly, Rita Okun, Sydell Roden, Gilda Sadow, Bert Saltzburg, Libby Suasner, Renee Schneider, Esther Schwartz <m0>and <m0>Shirley Zeisel.<m0><ep>
   <m0>Stan Cooke <m0>did a whole show video, <m0>Marvin Zelaznik <m0>played the music, <m0>Steve Bilbao <m0>handled the spotlight and <m0>Len Cartor <m0>and <m0>Sy Solow <m0>were the photographers. Producer and director of the show was <m0>Ken Collos. <m0>Wardrobe assistants were <m0>Dorothy Goldin, Rita Okun, Fran Nonkin, Judy Straus <m0>and <m0>Dorothy Greene.<m0> <m0>Jeanette Feinstein <m0>and <m0>Helen Silverstein <m0>assisted the models. <m0>Bert Saltzburg <m0>helped the models with their hair and <m0>Lee Eichler <m0>helped with their makeup.<ep>
   After the show, a box lunch was served, followed by dessert.<ep>
   The show was deemed to be one of the finest yet and Collos thanked clubhouse director <m0>Toni Gleeson <m0>and staffers <m0>Linda Harrell <m0>and <m0>Dave McGarvey <m0>for their cooperation.<ep>
   Attendance was limited to 600 people and was sold out for the seventh consecutive year.<ql>
