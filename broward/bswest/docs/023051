  Nicole, a fourth-grader from Silver Palms Elementary School, has an idea about a perfect name for a police horse (--) Chase.<ep>
  Thousands of youngsters from Silver Palms, temporarily in Cooper City, and other elementary schools in Pembroke Pines have suggested names for the city's second police horse.<ep>
   The horses, which are used for patrols and special events, enjoy people and sometimes bow their heads for youngsters to pet them.<ep>
  Ty, a friendly, chestnut-color horse, has been on patrol with officer Terry Burns for about eight years.<ep>
  The second horse, a former racehorse, originally had the name Wanna Do It Again.<ep>
  But that wasn't a simple police-horse name, Burns said.<ep>
  So the officers agreed to let children help decide on a replacement. After the playful brown-and-white horse toured the elementary schools, the youngsters colored drawings and jotted down name ideas.<ep>
  The winning name will be chosen by a panel of police officers and officials, and the child who submitted it will be honored May 18 at the Public Safety Department.<ep>
  ``They came up with some names that look like they put thought into it,'' Burns said.<ep>
  Among the entries were Brownie, Lightning, Cinnamon and Crime Stopper.<ep>
  Michael Zambrano, a fourth-grader at Pines Lakes Elementary, suggested Walter because he thinks the name is funny for a horse.<ep>
  He said he's glad the department uses horses because they can sneak up on criminals.<ep>
  ``They're a better way of transportation and less noisy,'' he said.<ep>
  Andi Caban, 7, of Palm Cove Elementary, suggested Michael (--) her cousin's name. Her friend, Ashley Perdomo, a kindergartner, suggested Jonathan.<ep>
  Andi said she likes the idea of police officers on horseback.<ep>
   ``I think it's great because then you don't have to use a car. Horses go faster,'' she said. ``Horses can go on the sidewalk and keep on running. Cars have to stop at the red light.''<ep>
   Miriam Eichenbaum, 8, of Pembroke Lakes Elementary School, suggested Brownie because the horse reminded her of a brownie with sugar.<ep>
  The advantages of the police horse, Burns said, include a broad field of vision for the officers. Also, a horse can maneuver in certain places (--) such as between cars (--) that automobiles can't.<ep>
  And horses serve as a way for children and others to meet police officers on a friendly, personal level.<ep>
  ``The horse draws the niceness out of people,'' said officer Ed Klingman, who patrols with the unnamed horse.<ep>
  Burns agreed.<ep>
  ``They come up and talk to me so they can pet the horse,'' she said.<ql>
