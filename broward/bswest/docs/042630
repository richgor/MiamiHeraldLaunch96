<m0>obin Jackson had a dream years ago. She wanted to open a retirement center with a twist (--) she wanted to include pets and call the place Robin's Nest. But instead, life has carried her through a nursing career, a job assisting a veterinarian and now she volunteers three days a week with seniors.<ep>
 Even though she didn't put it all together, she feels as though she's been able to make her dream come true. <ep>
 ``I did my nursing thing, I did my animal thing, now it's like I have my Robin's Nest,'' said Jackson. ``This is my niche.''<ep>
  Jackson, 39, drives 35 minutes from her home near the northern end of Fort Lauderdale beach every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday to the Southwest Focal Point Senior Center in Pembroke Pines to help out and have fun with neighborhood seniors. <ep>
 ``No matter how you need her, she's always there,'' said activities director Sue Robinson. ``We let her have two days off.''<ep>
 Jackson helps with a cooking class, leads singing and dancing and serves as chaperone on outings for shopping, dinner (--) even cruises. She quietly slips cash into the pot when an activity (--) or a senior's participation in it (--) is threatened.<ep>
 ``Anything having to do with food (--) I'm there,'' Jackson laughs. Then she gets serious. ``There's always folks that need help.''<ep>
 Jackson credits her husband, Colin Jackson, owner of Polar Motor Co. in Fort Lauderdale, for making it possible for her to retire in pursuit of helping others. <ep>
 ``My husband knows how much this means to me and he's all for it,'' said Jackson. ``He thinks this is the best thing that ever happened to me.''<ep>
 When Jackson joined the volunteer corps in 1992, she said the center served 240 seniors at a time, but since moving into a new facility last fall, more than 2,000 have registered for services. The center provides day programs for elderly, including Alzheimer patients, as well as the drop-in social program that Jackson helps with. Staff have recognized Jackson's dedication by appointing her to the center's board of directors.<ep>
 ``Being appointed to the board has been a thrill,'' Jackson said. ``I hope to make a difference. I have a lot of fun doing it, believe me.''<ep>
  Jackson and her ``Sunshine Singers'' travel around to nursing homes to provide entertainment. ``We like to visit people who are not as fortunate as we are,'' she said.<ep>
 On Wednesdays a band comes in and Jackson and the seniors line-dance together for some stimulating exercise. ``We dance up a storm,'' she says.<ep>
 Robinson, who recently nominated Jackson for a J.C. Penney Golden Rule Award for volunteering, said it's Jackson's infectious enthusiasm that makes her so special. Her nomination letter reads: ``She not only brings sunshine to our Sunshine Singers, she brings sunshine to everyone around her.'' <ep>
  Robinson adds, ``She's been such a dynamic person to my program.'' <ep>
  But it's not just three days of fun and games to Jackson. ``I want a chance to improve their lives,'' she said. ``You just sit and talk to these seniors and they can change your life in five minutes. They have so much wisdom to tell you.''<ql>
