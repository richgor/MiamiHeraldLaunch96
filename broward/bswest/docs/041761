<m0>nstead of a movie theater, homeowners in western Pembroke Pines may get more neighbors.<ep>
   The developer of a shopping center on the northeast corner of Pines Boulevard and Dykes Road plans to sell 24 acres of the property to Minto Builders, the developer of TownGate.<ep>
   The city's Planning and Zoning Board will review a proposal today to rezone the acreage to allow 72 homes. Part of the plan includes lowering the density of a portion of TownGate from five units per acre to three.<ep>
   The board will meet at 7:30 p.m. at the Pines Conference Center, 10211 Taft St.<ep>
   Michael Swerdlow Co. owns the land now zoned for a shopping mall and proposes to build a strip shopping center. Part of the plan included an 18-screen theater.<ep>
  Swerdlow withdrew the theater from the plans after encountering stiff resistance from residents and city officials.<ep>
  Resident Jeffrey Mutnik said he would rather have more people than a multiscreen theater.<ep>
   ``I think that's much better. We are not talking about bringing people from outside of the city at night,'' said Mutnik, a resident of Spring Valley. ``The only thing I would rather see is a school or playground.''<ep>
   Mutnik's objections to the theater mirrored his neighbors' concerns. Homeowners west of Interstate 75 said the theater would attract people from other parts of Broward and even Dade County.<ep>
   Crime and traffic would bleed onto their neighborhood streets, they said. Residents gathered signatures in opposition to the 18-screen theater and a 24-screen theater once planned for the southeast corner of Pines and 184th Avenue.<ep>
   Swerdlow still plans to build a shopping center, although not the 1.3-million-square-foot mall originally planned. The center would include a Winn-Dixie supermarket, a bank and restaurants.<ep>
   But plans for the center are far from being approved. The City Commission last week tabled approval of Swerdlow's decision to build a smaller shopping center.<ql>
