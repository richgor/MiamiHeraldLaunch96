ach school finds unique ways to honor the parents and community members who volunteer their time to help students. At Pines Lakes Elementary School in Pembroke Pines, all the students and teachers worked together to treat volunteers to a special brunch on Monday.<P>

 Students made all the decorations, from place mats to spring flowers and banners hung across the cafeteria, and gifts of refrigerator magnets and lapel pins. They also prepared a tribute program, Three Cheers for Volunteers, with a flag salute by Safety Patrol members and a parade featuring majorettes from the after-school baton-twirling club.<P>

 Third-grader Kaylee Dunford sang Colors of the Wind  from the movie Pocahontas, and Denise Orlin's fourth-grade class recited in unison the Robert Fulghum poem All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.<P>

 Serving as masters of ceremony were three Student Council members: President Jeffrey Fraser, a fifth-grader; Vice President Jonathan Shapiro, also a fifth-grader; and fourth-grade Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Zambrano, whose grandmother, Doris Barnett was selected as the school's Intergenerational Volunteer of the Year.<P>

  ``Mrs. Barnett has been coming here since Michael was in kindergarten,'' said school curriculum specialist Maria DeRosa.<P>

 Barnett works individually with students on mathematics and reading, bringing along a bag of treats when she visits twice each week.<P>

   ``At the beginning of the year, teachers ask `Who's got Michael?' because they know they'll get her, too,'' DeRosa said.<BR>
   Kindergartners at Miramar Elementary School had a special opportunity to work with Miami storyteller Linda Spitzer, courtesy of a Broward County School Board Learn and Serve grant that has provided an artist-in-residence at each of the schools in the Miramar Innovation Zone.<P>

 Spitzer visited the school four times in April, sharing stories about her own past, as well as cultural fables such as Anansi the Spider. She brought her stories to life with three-dimensional props, including a doll the size of students.<P>

 She told the children about growing up in Central Florida and of the many hours she spent with her grandmother, often making things out of fabric. She called the story The Quilt, each incident making up a square.<P>

  Students illustrated each of the nine vignettes on paper, making their own quilt picture. That night, teacher Marcia Gomulka encouraged them to take the paper home to use in sharing the stories with their families. Spitzer impressed on the kids how important it is to remember things and pass them on, explaining that many years ago, before books and television, everything was related by storytelling.<P>

 ``The children are finding that children all over the world -- even though they live differently -- have a lot in common,'' Gomulka said. ``This helps the children have a better understanding of what's going on in the world and learn how they can relate to others.''<BR>
   Students from Pembroke Pines and Chapel Trail elementary school helped the Pembroke Pines Landscape Advisory Board celebrate Arbor Day by participating in an art contest. Students made posters about the importance of trees to the environment.<P>

 Winning entries were displayed at Pembroke Pines Recreation Center during the city's birthday celebration April 27-28. Some students, like Brook Weber, a Chapel Trail fourth-grader whose entry took a first-place prize, took advantage of the display for a photo opportunity. Brook stood proudly in front of her picture long enough for dad to take a snapshot for her album.<P>

  Other first-place winners were: Jordan Krigg, kindergartner, and Benjamin Babcock, a fifth-grader at Chapel Trail. From Pembroke Pines Elementary: first-grader Ricky Holder, second-grader Andres Fernandez and third-grader Cara Riccitelli.<P>

 Second-place winners were Ashley Schwartz, a fourth-grader at Pembroke Pines Elementary, and Chapel Trail second-grader Ashley Craig, and third-grader Jean Maranto.<BR>
