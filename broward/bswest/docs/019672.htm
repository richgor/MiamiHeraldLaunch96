andi Gicobbe scored two runs and made a force play at first as the Delta Blue Angels defeated Ray's Rug Rats, 13-7, in Pembroke Pines Softball Midgets (ages 8 to 10) April 18 at Fletcher Park.<P>

   Each time at bat, Rachel Baltz, Sarah Barlow, Heather Clark, Jaclyn Iacino and Ashley Padgett reached base. Corinne Melton pitched one shutout inning of relief. An injured Keli Perez provided moral support.   Gary Hannon made a spectacular diving catch in left center field as the Rangers (13-0-1) defeated the Marlins, 37-20, in Coach Pitch (ages 6 to 8) baseball April 22 at Maxwell Park.<P>

   Bennie Lombardo, Mark McNicholas and Chris Sacconi caught several pop ups, and Sacconi and first baseman Chad Rose combined on a double play. McNicholas and Sacconi hit home runs, and Anthony DeSimone was five for six.<P>

   Earlier in the week, the Rangers derailed the Yankees, 20-3. Second baseman Preston Nevins started an exciting double play, throwing to Rose for a force out at first base. Rose threw the ball to McNicholas at third base who threw to catcher J.L. Carranza who tagged the runner.<P>

   <LI> James DelEtoile and Brian Downer each hit a home run as the Yankees defeated the Red Sox, 19-7, April 19. Pitcher Anthony Varrell caught a pop-up, and catcher Spencer Zawacki made a good play at the plate.<P>

   <LI> In Senior League (ages 13 to 15), Joey Cancio-Bello went two for four with a double, a triple, two runs, and three RBI to lift the Ireco Yankees over the West Pembroke Pines Marlins, 13-4, April 17. Winning pitcher Danny Zambrano struck out four in three innings, and reliever Daveon Carbajal closed the game striking out nine in three innings.<P>

   Zambrano also batted two for three with three RBIs.<P>

   <LI> The Marlins improved to 10-0 with an 18-15 victory over a tough Mets team in T-ball (ages 4 to 6) April 20. Dorian Graham played a strong all-around game, and Jared Dobbins and Vinny Milano also performed well. Jason Reddy added solid hitting.<BR>
   Winning pitcher Joseph Livolsi struck out seven in four innings to lead the Orioles over the Rockies, 13-8, April 26 in Majors (ages 11 and 12). Reliever Jason Jarrell allowed two runs and one hit. <P>

   Jarrell also went two for four and scored three runs. Rafael Gaberias was three for five, and Pat O'Connell went two for three. The Orioles and Indians ended the first half tied for the division lead.<BR>
  David Garcia shone defensively, and Brian Rucker had a nice assist as the West Pembroke Pines Optimist 11 and younger team (4-3-1) defeated host Hollywood, 7-3, April 28 at Jefferson Park. Rucker also scored four goals. Chris Chapman and Scott Johnson had one goal apiece, and goalie Russell Pittman played well.<P>

   Earlier in the day, the West Pembroke Pines Optimist 9 and younger team derailed Hollywood, 9-2. Michael Benoit anchored a solid defense, and Mack Cummins scored four times. Christopher Stoll and Danny Garcia each scored twice, and Aaron Lee once. Goalie Jason Crook allowed just one goal in two periods.<BR>
