eeping lawns green in Southwest Broward can sure take a lot of green out of homeowners' wallets.<P>

   Landscape company contracts, fertilizer, new flowers, more shrubs, tree treatments and sprinkler systems -- add it up and you've got big money coming out of quarterly maintenance fees to pay for spruced-up community common areas.<P>

   But isn't that the image you were looking for when you bought your home? A homeowner association board's commitment to keeping grass green can make or break a neighborhood's identity -- and may even boost property values.<P>

    Homeowners in larger developments such as SilverLakes and Chapel Trail spend a big chunk of their annual maintenance fees for landscaping. Chapel Trail's financial reports list the development's landscaping costs at $407,475 last year. Total operating expenses for 1995 were more than $1.2 million, all used to take care of the 15-neighborhood development west of Interstate 75.<P>

   East Lake Townhome residents, tired of renting and repairing lawn mowers, have recently spent $10,327 for two 18-horsepower John Deere lawn cutters. Townhome association board members shopped around and found buying the durable lawn cutters to be the most cost-effective way to maintain neighborhood common areas. Maintenance supervisor John DeSantis oversees landscaping projects in the 332-townhouse neighborhood on Taft Street between Douglas Road and Palm Avenue in Pembroke Pines.<P>

   Lawn mowers, landscaping and keeping their neighborhood looking pretty is on the agenda at the East Lake neighbors' annual spring meeting at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in the complex meeting room. Residents with questions should call the management office at 432-6888.<BR>
