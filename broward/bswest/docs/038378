<m0>ollywood officials are establishing a forum for Asian Americans and others to discuss matters of interest.<ep>
  The Asian-American Advisory Committee will have 11 volunteer members appointed by the City Commission.<ep>
  Two other commission-appointed groups, the African-American Advisory Council and the Hispanic Affairs Advisory Council, also address issues of interest to ethnic minorities. Those councils were established in 1992 and 1993.<ep>
  Commissioner Eleanor Sobel said she proposed an Asian-American Advisory Council after discussing the idea with Asian-American leaders.<ep>
  Kee Eng, the city's special events coordinator who participates in other Asian-American groups, said Asian-Americans represent about 1.5 percent of Hollywood's population.<ep>
  The city has a variety of Asian-owned businesses, he said, and the Hollywood Asian Film Festival was held recently.<ep>
  ``There is a vibrant Asian community willing to contribute to life in Hollywood,'' Eng said.<ep>
  He said he supported the establishment of the advisory council.<ep>
  ``It recognizes the contributions and the value of the Asian-American community,'' Eng said. <ep>
  The city is accepting resume(acu)s and statements of interest from those who want to be considered for a post on the advisory council. Eligible nominees include Asian Americans who have homes or jobs in the city, and others who have a special interest in or knowledge of the Asian-American community.<ep>
  The Asian-American community in South Florida includes ethnic groups from a geographic area that includes the Middle East, Eng said.<ep>
  The applications are available at the city clerk's office in City Hall, 2600 Hollywood Blvd., Room 211, or by calling 921-3211.<ql>
