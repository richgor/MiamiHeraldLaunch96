<m0>hen people came to <m0>Emilia Guzzardo <m0>at Broward Community College in Pembroke Pines for help with their home or work computers, she knew there was a need for a computer club in South Broward.<ep>
 ``Retired people just come in and ask for help,'' said Guzzardo, who is secretary for the Office Systems Technology Department at BCC's South Campus. ``We encourage them to take a class.''<ep>
 But classes aren't always enough.<ep>
 Retirees, BCC students and business people in the community all are looking for help in buying computers, training their staff, or selecting software, Guzzardo said.<ep>
 Last November, Guzzardo became coordinator for the Broward Computer Club, which is sponsored by BCC.<ep>
 About 200 people showed up for the first meeting, and 140 signed up for the group's mailing list.<ep>
 Most of the people were from South Broward, but the club also draws from Miami and Boca Raton.<ep>
 The next meeting will be at 6:15 p.m. Wednesday in the Mass Media Room of the South Regional Library, 7300 Pines Blvd., Pembroke Pines.<ep>
 Speakers will include <m0>Dan Keating, <m0>who writes a computer column for The Herald. He will give a hands-on demonstration on how to use the Freenet. Also, <m0>Jerrold<m0> <m0>Rosen, <m0>vice president of the Savings of America's Pembroke Pines Branch, will talk about using computers for online banking.<ep>
 Guzzardo hopes to recruit officers for the club, which will break for the summer and start meeting monthly again in September.<ep>
 Membership is free and open to the public.<ep>
 Guzzardo said the club's goal is to develop a resource list of members who can help others with computer problems and sharing information.<ep>
 For information about the Broward Computer Club, call Guzzardo at 963-8841.<ql>
<m0>Tiger Cubs take a Tumble<ep>
<m0>   Southwest Broward's youngest members of the Boy Scouts gathered at Robbins Lodge in Davie for a Tiger Tumble.<ep>
 More than 100 Tiger Cubs, who are 6 years old and in their first year of Boy Scouts, and their parents participated in the April 27 event.<ep>
 The boys made toolboxes, ran an obstacle course and created drums from tin cans, said <m0>Jim Border, <m0>chairman of the Boy Scouts' Miccosukee District, which includes Pembroke Pines and Miramar.<ep>
 <m0>Cindy Beasley <m0>of Pack 160 at Hawkes Bluff Elementary School in Davie coordinated the event.<ep>
 This was the first Tiger Tumble organized by the Miccosukee District, which was formed in January to accommodate the growth in Southwest Broward.<ep>
 Anyone interested in volunteering in Boy Scouts or registering their son in Scouts can call 584-4200.<ql>
<m0>Submarine training<ep>
<m0>   Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class <m0>Shawn Tobin <m0>has graduated from the basic enlisted submarine course at the Naval Submarine School in Groton, Conn.<ep>

 During the five-week course, Tobin learned about the operation of nuclear submarines.<ql>
