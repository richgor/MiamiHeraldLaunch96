<B><FONT SIZE=+3></FONT></B>eacher Appreciation Week at Pembroke Lakes Elementary School had an added flavor -- the students and PTA tied in their efforts to thank teachers with the school's 20th anniversary. Bell bottoms, polyester and disco records helped set the tone for Wednesday's special luncheon, featuring karaoke to the likes of Staying Alive  from Saturday Night Fever.<P>

  Teachers received special gifts each day, including '70s pop-culture icons -- pet rocks made by students, gold-wrapped chocolate nuggets with a note attached that said, ``You're worth your weight in gold,'' and a brass bell with an apple on top.<P>

 Each student made a poster telling why his or her teacher was the best. One student compared her teacher to an angel. Another decorated his poster with candy bars to describe his teacher: ``She's Nutrageous. She keeps me in mint condition and gives us hugs and kisses when we're in a crunch.''<P>

  PTA member Donna Mancinelli, who served as chairwoman for the week's activities, collected photographs and words of wisdom from each teacher for a special keepsake booklet of their years at Pembroke Lakes.<P>

 ``Everybody put their own ideas in, but Donna put everything together to make our Teacher Appreciation Week such a great success,'' said PTA President Karen Tandlich.<BR>
Phone Pioneers help out<P>

  The BellSouth Telephone Pioneers, a team of volunteers who reach out to many Broward schools, will visit their Partner in Education, The Quest Center, Wednesday night. The volunteers will serve refreshments and help out at an end-of-the-year dance for special-needs students, alumni, and residents of area group homes.<P>

 ``It provides an opportunity for the students to have a little more interaction and a chance to further develop their social skills,'' said Telephone Pioneer volunteer coordinator Pat Caruso. ``The most rewarding part is that some of these special-needs kids can't perform daily living tasks yet they can remember the songs and the dances. Seeing them having such a good time with their friends gives you that warm and fuzzy feeling.''<P>

 Caruso said that when the Pioneers first sponsored school dances with the PTO four years ago, about 50 kids participated. This week, they expect more than 130 kids to attend.<P>

   The dance will be from 7 to 8:45 p.m. Wednesday at the school, 6401 Charleston St., Hollywood.<BR>
A special arts festival<P>

   Sawgrass Mills mall was the site again this year for the Very Special Arts Festival. This fifth annual event showcased the artistic accomplishments of students with disabilities as they perform with their peers.<P>

 Each day was filled with dancing, singing and musical performances for the pleasure of family, friends and shoppers. Choruses from Annabel C. Perry, Nova Eisenhower and Fairway elementaries sang, Walter C. Young Middle School drama students performed, and Palm Cove Elementary's unique steel drum corps played.<P>

 ``It's their enthusiasm that makes it so great,'' said instructor Al Sewer, who works with the team of 16 fourth- and fifth-graders during the after-school program. Sewer, who learned to play and make steel drums as a child living in the U.S. Virgin Islands, brought his skills to the school because his wife, Anne Eggleston, is a teacher there.<P>

  ``They learn so quickly,'' Sewer said. ``It takes maybe four or five lessons and they're able to play a complete song. You couldn't do that on a piano.''<BR>
