<m0>wo building supply companies that opened in the early days of West Broward's building boom are pulling up stakes in the next several months.<ep>
   Builders Square will shut its Davie store at 8944 State Road 84 in late June. Scotty's is closing locations at 8333 Pines Blvd. in Pembroke Pines and at 6931 NW 88th Ave. in Tamarac.<ep>
   The closings will affect more than 50 workers at the stores, but company officials expect some employees to transfer to other sites in Broward. Builders Square is working with local employment agencies to help displaced workers.<ep>
   The stores are being shut because they did not fit into company reorganization plans. Scotty's officials also cited slack sales as reasons for closing their two stores in West Broward.<ep>
   Builders Square has been reorganizing its chain into a Builders Square II format, featuring 13 different departments in much larger facilities (--) about double the size of the Davie store, said Jeanne Janes, a spokeswoman for the chain.<ep>
   ``We couldn't expand it, and we couldn't locate a new property near it [for the planned expansion],'' Janes said. So the site was placed on a closure list, she said.<ep>
   Builders Square has tentatively set a June 29 departure date and liquidators began selling off merchandise April 25. The exact date when the facility is vacated will depend on sales, she said.<ep>
   No new plans have been announced for the 59,000-square-foot facility leased by the chain. Builders Square opened in January 1992. The chain operates four additional stores in Broward.<ep>
   Scotty's officials are vacating the 30,000-square-foot complex in Pembroke Pines within the next two to three months. Company officials aren't sure what is planned next for that facility.<ep>
   The hardware and building supply store opened in Pembroke Pines in 1987. Officials expect most of the staff to shift to other stores in Broward and elsewhere in South Florida.<ep>
   The Tamarac and Pembroke Pines stores are being closed because of slack sales and plans to target newer growth areas.<ql>
