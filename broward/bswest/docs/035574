<m0>eveloper Ron Bergeron has withdrawn for now his request to have 50 acres in unincorporated Broward annexed into Pembroke Pines.<ep>
   Instead, he wants the commission to vote sometime in the future on the annexation request along with a proposal to change the property from industrial to residential and commercial, said Don Hall, Bergeron's attorney.<ep>
   The commission approved the annexation on first reading in April and planned to vote on it again last week. But in a letter to city officials, Bergeron's attorney Hall said he planned to present a development agreement attached to the annexation request and land-use changes.<ep>
   Both requests must be presented to the city's Planning and Zoning Board before the commission takes a vote.<ep>
   Bergeron intends to include the land in a 286-acre residential and commercial development north of Stirling Road and west of 190th Avenue. The project calls for as many as 552 single-family homes.<ql>
