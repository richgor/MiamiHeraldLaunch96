<m0>he <m0>Pines Baptist Church <m0>is moving its office to a building that congregants bought last month.<ep>
  The 200-member congregation raised $90,000 in 10 weeks to put a down payment on the property and refurbish it. The office should be up and running by Friday, said the Rev. <m0>Steve Nerger, <m0>pastor at Pines Baptist.<ep>
  The site is slightly larger than the church's old office, which was a 2,000-square-foot rented space inside a shopping center at 9877 Pines Blvd. in Pembroke Pines.<ep>
  The recently acquired building, at 120 NW Douglas Rd., is really a 2,400-square-foot home that has been zoned as commercial property, Nerger said.<ep>
  Parishioners plan to enlarge the structure by another 1,000 square feet this summer, he said.<ep>
  ``We're actually getting more room for less money,'' he said. ``And in the future, we intend to use the property as an asset toward possibly constructing our own worship facility.''<ep>
  Until then, the church will continue holding services at 10:30 a.m. Sundays at Pines Middle School, 200 NW Douglas Rd.<ep>
  Call 435-8484 for more information. Office hours are 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday.<ql>

  Garza, 28, has been working with parishioners at St. Maximilian Kolbe for the past year.<ep>
  As a new priest, Garza will be assigned to St. Mary Star of the Sea Church in Key Biscayne. He will begin serving the parish on June 11.<ql>
