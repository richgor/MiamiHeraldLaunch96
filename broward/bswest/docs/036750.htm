t a new apartment complex in Hollywood run by the Salvation Army, a mother is making the transition from a world of drugs to one in which she and her 3-year-old son can lead a productive life.<P>

   The 38-year-old woman, who declined to give her name to protect her privacy, is now attending ministry school and volunteering at a church library.<P>

   She, her husband and son are one of the families living at Plymouth Colony, 1960 Sherman St., one of two neighboring 18-unit apartment buildings for formerly homeless families who are getting back on track.<P>

   The second Plymouth Colony building, at 1950 Sherman St., opened April 23 and should be filling up as families qualify, said Salvation Army Capt. Ward Matthews.<P>

   About 70 people or 18 families can live in each of the apartment buildings.<P>

  The program is aimed at providing affordable housing, child care, counseling and job training, Matthews said.<P>

   The cost of the buildings, renovations, staff and other services are being paid for through a $1 million anonymous donation, plus another $1 million in smaller donations and $2.8 million in federal housing grants, he said.<P>

  To qualify, families first are admitted to the Salvation Army's emergency shelter in Fort Lauderdale, which has eight rooms. Then they must meet certain guidelines and agree to various rules regarding such things as saving money, curfews, apartment inspection and a prohibition on alcoholic beverages in the building, he said. They can stay as long as two years.<P>

   Those are rules the former drug addict's family has accepted. Before receiving help from the Salvation Army, the woman who is trying to put her life back together was in jail for violating probation. Her husband, a trucker, and their son were living in a car after the landlord evicted them from a house in Fort Lauderdale.<P>

  She said Plymouth Colony is a chance to refocus.<P>

  ``We're building to where we can financially stand on our own,'' she said. ``They are retraining us how to live and not just exist.''<P>

  She described the 18-unit apartment building as friendly, with sharing, protective and cooperative neighbors.<P>

  She said she is relearning even simple aspects of life, such as spending quality time with her son, socializing, exercising and keeping a schedule.<P>

  She does not mind most of the Salvation Army's rules.<P>

  ``For the most part, the rules are for the benefit of being able to be mainstreamed back in,'' she said.
