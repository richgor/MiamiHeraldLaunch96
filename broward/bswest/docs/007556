<m0>he <m0>Grand Palms <m0>ladies who lunch often play a game of bring 'n' brag as an icebreaker.<ep>
   Doris Sobel organizes the community's luncheon club, a group that gathers about once a month to get a little culture lesson, to meet friends and to enjoy lunch. The club will meet at noon Friday at Fran's, the country club restaurant at 110 Grand Palms Dr. in Pembroke Pines.<ep>
   ``This meeting provides a good opportunity to get to know each other in a more meaningful and personal way,'' Sobel said.<ep>
   Those attending are asked to bring a homemade handicraft or tell an interesting story or a good joke.<ep>
   Grand Palms is a collection of 800 homes off Pines Boulevard just west of Interstate 75.<ep>
   Newcomers and Grand Palms residents interested in joining the group can call Sobel at 433-3099.<ql>
