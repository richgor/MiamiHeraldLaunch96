<m0>into Builders, the developer of TownGate, will build 72 homes on part of the property once slated for a 1.3 million square foot shopping mall at the northeast corner of Dykes Road and Pines Boulevard. <ep>
  The Pembroke Pines Planning and Zoning Board approved a rezoning request Thursday that will allow the 72 homes and a lowering of the density on a portion of the land from five units per acre to three. Michael Swerdlow Co., which planned the mall, will sell 24 acres to Minto Homes and build a shopping center instead on the remaining land. <ep>
   Once Pembroke Lakes Mall opened, the company decided to build a smaller center with an 18-screen theater. Swerdlow, however, withdrew plans for a movie theater after neighbors complained and the planning and zoning board rejected the proposal. <ep>
  Thursday night, the planning and zoning board also approved plans for 65 storage units at Chapel Trail Industrial Park at 209th Avenue and Nineth Street, site plans for renovation of Red Lobster, 296 N. University Dr. and for a store at Pembroke Crossing, on the southeast corner of Pines Boulevard and Flamingo Road.<ql>
