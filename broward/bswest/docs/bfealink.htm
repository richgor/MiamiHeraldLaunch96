Businesses link clients<BR>
with homes overseas</H2><BR><BR>


<B>By FRANK FERNANDEZ</B><BR>
Herald Staff Writer<BR>



    <P>  Guerrero Multiservices, a small yellow Miramar storefront,
 serves as one of dozens of Broward's gateways joining families
 separated by the sea and the chase for a better life in America.</P>

    <P>  Broward immigrants take a break from their pursuit of the
 American dream to visit Guerrero and similar businesses that dot
 the county's landscape to wire money to families in the
 Caribbean or Central and South America.</P>

     <P> Jose and Altagracia Guerrero opened the store about a year
 ago at 6314 Pembroke Rd. in part because of a demand to meet the
 needs of the area's growing population of Hispanics and West
 Indians who have relatives remaining in the old countries.</P>

<P>      "There are a lot of Hispanics in the area," Altagracia
 Guerrero said.
  
  <P>  Besides wiring money overseas, customers can call home from
 four private phone closets behind glass doors.

<P>      On this day, Erville Cunningham of Hollywood stepped out of
 a phone booth after calling his native Jamaica to let a daughter
 know that he had just wired money to her.

<P>      "Most immigrants have family back home, wife and children,
 mother, father," said Cunningham, who grew up in Kingston. "They
 try to help the ones back home."

<P>      The approximately 200,000 foreign-born Broward residents
 appear to be the most important market for the approximately 75
 "niche" businesses in the county that offer services ranging
 from money wiring to filing income taxes.
c <P>   "If you do not diversify, that will create a big hole in
 your business," said Casimir, who owns another store at 2543 N.
 State Road 7. "In order to keep up, a small business must really
 do more than one thing."

  <P>    About 1,000 of the stores, called transmitting services,
 exist throughout the state. Dade boasts the most of any county
 -- about 300, said Doug Johnson, assistant director of the state
 Division of Banking, the agency that regulates the businesses.

<P>     They compete with traditional companies, like Western
 Union, which is now aggressively expanding throughout South
 America, a market the money-transfer giant entered only in 1992.

  <P>    In addition to wiring money to Colombia, Alberto Quinones
 sends packages overseas and offers financial consultant services
 from his Pronto Envios (fast shipment) business at the Baby
 Superstore plaza in Pembroke Pines. Quinones is an agent of
 Gloria Envia, a popular Colombian money-wiring company.

 <P>     Luis Carlos Castillo of Cooper City likes the personal
 service he gets whenever he stops in.

 <P>     "Don Alberto knows who I am," Castillo said. "If I go to
 the post office, who do I complain to if something goes wrong?
 And Gloria Envia is well-known in Colombia."

  <P>    Gloria Envia has opened five outlets in Broward in the past
 year, said company treasurer Mauricio Puche, based in Miami.

     <P> Castillo is shipping down a package of catalogs to his
 business partners in Bogota. The charge is $13. As Quinones does
 the paperwork, the two discuss the state of their native
 country. They also talk about business opportunities in the
 United States and Latin America.

    <P> That familiarity with Colombia is one of the reasons
 Castillo said he continues to do business with Pronto Envios.

    <P>  Regulators have had no problems with the businesses,
 Johnson said. It could be because customers may not know what
 state agency to complain to. Or it could be that operators
 realize the quickest way for their business to fail is if they
 fail to deliver. Customer satisfaction -- or dissatisfaction
 -- in such businesses travels quickly by word of mouth, Johnson
 said.

    <P>  "It's a niche business," he said. "If the transmitter
 doesn't get the money to the destination, then word travels fast
 in the community."

    <P>  Broward County also has received no complaints about the
 businesses, said Larry Kaplan, acting director of Broward's
 Consumer Affairs Division. The places are popular with
 immigrants because of a shared cultural background, Kaplan said.

 <P>     "They have the contacts in the various places they are
 shipping to, whether it's the islands or South America," Kaplan
 said.

   <P>   "They speak the language of the people who need their
 services."

     <p ALIGN=CENTER> TIPS FOR CONSUMERS<P>

     <P> Dozens of small "niche" businesses dot the landscape to
 give Broward's growing immigrant population a link to the
 homeland. Services range from money transfers to shipments to
 filing income taxes.

    <P>  Business owners and a state regulatory agency offer the
 following tips to consumers who use such companies:</P>

      * Each location should clearly display a license from the
 Florida Division of Banking.<BR>
      * Each location also should have an occupational license
 from the city or county.<BR>
      * Always save your receipt. That receipt should have the
 name of the registrant, like Gloria Envia, clearly imprinted on
 it. If there's a problem, clients should return to the store
 first to try to clear it up.<BR>
      * Compare prices. Also, ask how long it will take for the
 money to be available to the receiver.<BR>
      * Ask whether the exchange rate will be calculated at the
 time you send the money or at the time the receiver picks it up.<BR>
      * Each store should provide customers with a toll-free
 number for consumer complaints or information. The number to the
 state comptroller's consumer hotline is (800) 848-3792.<BR>
