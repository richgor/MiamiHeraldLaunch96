 Let's Talk Cellular, a Miami company that sells cellular phones, pagers and related paraphernalia in mall kiosks, Thursday won the 1996 Cutting Edge Award from the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce.<P>

  The company won from among 13 finalists, deemed by judges as stand-outs because of their innovation, niche marketing, growth, employee empowerment and customer service. The firms were recognized at a luncheon at the Biltmore Hotel Country Club in Coral Gables.<P>

  The winner impressed the judges ``with the overall niche strategy they were creating,'' said Larry Harris, chairman of last year's winner, Pollo Tropical, and one of this year's judges. ``It's a very competitive market they're in, but they've focused on the mall niche, which they've done very well, and they've improved from the year before.''<P>

  Let's Talk Cellular was a finalist last year, when the chamber introduced the award to recognize and encourage entrepreneurial excellence.<P>

  Founded by two college friends in the back of a van in 1989, Let's Talk Cellular now runs 27 mall kiosks that sign up cellular phone users and sell phones, pagers and other wireless devices. Its revenues increased from $1.5 million in 1993 to about $8.3 million in 1995.<P>

  ``Last year was great just to be honored,'' said Nick Molina, the company's 28-year-old president and chief executive. ``And this year it shows that we improved. We're proud.''<P>

  ``It makes you want to live up to the standards that got you here,'' said Chairman Brett Beveridge, 31.<P>

  The chamber also recognized two runners-up: The Vincam Group, based in Coral Gables, and the PMG Pharmed Group of Miami.<P>

  Vincam provides human resources management services, such as training, employee manuals and administrative help, to employers in Florida, Georgia and Michigan. Its revenues have increased from $138.1 million in 1993 to about $239 million in 1995.<P>

  PMG Pharmed distributes medical and pharmaceutical products in Florida and Central America. Its 1995 revenues were about $44 million, compared with $31 million in 1993.<BR>
