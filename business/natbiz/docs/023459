<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) The most lucrative federal auction in history closed Monday, reaping $10.2 billion for the Treasury and setting the stage for unprecedented competition in the wireless phone service market.<ep>
   Starting about a year from now, prices for basic mobile phone service as well as for souped-up services like wireless voice mail, paging, and text messaging are sure to come down as these new companies enter the market, analysts say.<ep>
   NextWave Personal Communications Inc., an obscure Korean-backed company based in San Diego, will be one of the biggest new entrants. It's paying $4.2 billion for advanced cellular licenses known as personal communications services, or PCS, in 56 markets including New York, Washington and Los Angeles.<ep>
   The licenses went for ``far more than everybody anticipated,'' said Mark Lowenstein, vice-president of wireless research with the Yankee Group.<ep>
   Other big winners, also with Korean and other Asian companies' backing, are DCR Communications Inc. of Washington, D.C., the No. 2 bidder with licenses for 43 markets including Chicago, Dallas and Detroit, at $1.4 billion; GWI PCS Inc. of Dallas, with 14 licenses including ones in Miami, San Francisco and Atlanta, for $1.1 billion; and BDPCS Inc. of Portola Valley, California, with 17 licenses at $870 million.<ep>
``The race is on to build a network,'' Lowenstein said.<ep>
