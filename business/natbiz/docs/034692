<m0>  Federal regulators put AT&T on equal footing with other long-distance rivals Thursday by lifting restrictions on what it can charge customers for international calls and services.<ep>
   AT&T may now charge whatever the market will bear for its international services (--) the same rule that applies to competitors such as MCI and Sprint.<ep>
   Residential customers, however, won't notice any immediate changes in AT&T international bills.<ep>
   ``We're committed to keeping per minute rates at 1995 levels for the next three years,'' said Julie Spechler, an AT&T spokeswoman.<ep>
   Last October, the Federal Communications Commission freed AT&T from rate caps on its domestic service for<ju>
its residential and small business customers.<ep>
   The restrictions were a remnant of the mid-1980s, just after the break-up of the AT&T monopoly when the FCC still deemed AT&T the dominant long-distance carrier. To promote competition, upstart long-distance companies such as MCI were not subject to the same rate caps and regulations.<ep>
   ``Now the FCC recognizes there are a lot of players out there,'' Spechler said. ``We'll be able to go to market quickly with new prices and services just as our competitors do. It's much less burdensome for us now, and consumers will receive the greatest benefit now that all the carriers are able to compete on the same footing.''<ql>
