   A federal appeals court in Philadelphia Friday threw out a $1.3 billion legal settlement that would have brought to a close tens of thousands of future asbestos personal-injury cases.<ep>
   The decision could end the possibility of a global resolution for asbestos injury cases, which have clogged federal courts for a decade. The ruling says it is inherently unfair to force people who are not yet sick to accept the same settlement terms as those who already have developed asbestos-related disease.<ep>
   The decision could have a much broader impact if it is applied to plaintiffs in a range of cases, including those involving the tobacco industry, silicone breast implants, heart valves, pacemakers and other products that allegedly cause debilitating illnesses, according to legal experts.<ep>
   ``The ramifications of this decision go well beyond the asbestos conflict,'' said William R. Hanlon, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys in the case.<ep>
   Harvard law Professor Lawrence Tribe, who argued against the settlement, called the decision ``momentous. This puts a real cap on how far class actions can go. . . . It says it's inconceivable that people who haven't been hurt yet can be represented by the same people as those who are already hurt.''<ep>
   U.S. Circuit Court Judge Edward R. Becker, who authored the decision of the three-judge panel, was clearly aware of its import, writing: ``Every decade presents a few great cases that force the judicial system to choose between forging a solution to a major social problem on the one hand, and preserving its institutional values on the other. This is one of them.''<ep>
   Becker's decision said that the problem of asbestos litigation cannot be solved in the courts and should be acted on by Congress.<ep>
   Lawyers said it was too soon to tell what impact the case might have on other class actions, but noted that courts around the country are grappling with the question in different ways and Becker's decision might bring the issue to a head.<ep>
   ``I think this is the death knell of cases that attempt to use the courts to set up an alternative dispute resolution,'' said Alan Morrison, an attorney for Public Citizen and one of the lawyers who argued against the settlement. He noted, however, he was sure the case would be argued up to the Supreme Court.<ep>
   The Philadelphia case, known as the ``Georgine'' case after Robert A. Georgine, the lead settlement plaintiff, involved the claims of potentially millions of persons who have been exposed to asbestos on the job.<ep>
   Although asbestos was banned in the late 1970s, people could continue to become sick because of a latency period of up to 40 years. Their ailments could range from minor respiratory problems to deadly mesothelioma, a type of lung cancer.<ep>
   Federal judges, who had long worried about the logjam caused by thousands of new asbestos cases being filed around the country, had encouraged a nationwide resolution of the cases.<ep>
   In early 1993, a number of plaintiffs' lawyers who have been involved in asbestos litigation for years filed the Georgine case. On the same day in Philadelphia they filed three things: the class-action suit, the response of the 20 former asbestos makers that are still solvent, and the proposed settlement.<ep>
   The legal package made it clear that the 20 defendant companies would not settle the whole case unless they could settle those cases that would arise in the next 40 to 50 years.<ep>
   Part of the problem with such a settlement, argued lawyers who opposed it, is that the people who will be affected by it have no way of knowing who they are. Becker agreed.<ep>
   In the asbestos settlement, Becker ruled, the class of all people somehow exposed to injurious amounts of asbestos over a lifetime did not contain enough common elements to meet the federal requirements for a certified class. Thus, lawyers could not offer adequate representation to those who may become sick in the future.<ep>
