<m0>   DALLAS (--) (AP) (--) Tissues are getting very complicated.<ep>
   The makers of Kleenex plan to take on moisturizer-laden Procter & Gamble's Puffs Plus with new tissues loaded with all kinds of concoctions intended to make blowing your nose a little less irritating.<ep>
   Starting in July, Kimberly-Clark will sell two new tissues, one implanted with Vitamin E and aloe, and another with menthol, eucalyptus and silicone.<ep>
   And here's something a hanky could never do: Each time one of the ``high-performance facial tissues'' is pulled from the box, tiny microcapsules release its aroma. <m1> <m0>The tissues are stronger and softer than the low-performance variety.<ep>
    But allergy sufferers might find some problems with the new, scented product.<ep>
   ``None of our patients can use anything like that,'' said Debbie Ansley, office manager of the Allergy & Asthma Center of Duncanville, a Dallas suburb. ``We can't even wear cologne in our office,'' she said.<ep>
   Wendi Strong, a spokeswoman for Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark, agrees that there may be some people who can't use the menthol and eucalyptus product. <m1> <m0>``It's also meant for people with colds,'' she said.<ep>
      The new large-sized Kleenex should be handy for people who have gale-sized sneezes, she said. The product is three-ply, which makes it one-and-a-half times larger than regular tissue.<ep>
   ``We've always sold extra-large tissues,'' said Strong, explaining that the tissue is now becoming part of the Coldcare line. ``They used to be called `man-sized.'''<ep>
