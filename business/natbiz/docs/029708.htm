  WASHINGTON -- Phone companies nationwide are proposing that local phone bills rise by about $10 a month over the next several years.<P>

   The companies say that the local rate increases would be more than offset by declining long-distance bills and lower rates for add-on services such as call waiting and caller identification. But consumer groups dispute that claim, saying that the net effect would be higher phone bills for Americans.<P>

   Bigger phone bills are just what lawmakers and the industry said would not result from a telecommunications law that was enacted in February. Supporters of the deregulatory bill trumpeted a new era in which brisk competition would mean lower rates and more choices for consumers.<P>

   The proposals for higher local rates have engendered some initial opposition at the Federal Communications Commission, which would have to approve the plan. ``I'm totally focused on the need to keep the local phone bill affordable,'' said FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt.<P>

   The phone companies' rate proposals are part of a debate mandated by the telecommunications bill over how to continue a decades-old program in which certain phone services are deliberately overpriced in order to generate about $18 billion a year in subsidies to local phone companies.<P>

   Much of these subsidies goes to provide service in rural areas, where it can cost up to four times as much to wire up a home as in a city, and to give rate breaks to low-income households. The rest of the money is used to pay off the phone companies' past investments in network equipment.<P>

   The crux of the phone companies' plan is to generate much of the subsidy pool by raising local rates. ``Right now the average local rate is about $18. Over the next four or five years, it's reasonable to think of a $28 basic rate,'' said Mary McDermott, vice president of regulatory policy for the United States Telephone Association, which represents phone companies.<P>

   Her figure roughly coincides with the findings of a study of the FCC filings released Tuesday by a coalition of consumer advocacy groups.<P>

   The groups say that of 13 telephone companies that sent proposals to the FCC, most suggested that local rates would have to rise to pay for universal service subsidies. Only two -- Nynex and MCI -- were against any local rate increases.<P>

   About $13 billion of the $18 billion in subsidies comes from inflated ``access fees'' that long-distance companies pay to local companies to begin and complete long-distance calls, and other artificially high charges for such services as caller ID and business phone use.<P>

   The consensus approach among the phone companies is to price those services according to what they cost to provide. That would cut the phone companies' revenues by about $13 billion, according to the study by the consumer groups.<P>

   The local companies say they would need to make it up somewhere else. The main source would be local telephone rates. These increases, they suggest, could be accomplished through federally mandated fees tacked onto local phone bills, as well as through higher rates approved at the state level.
