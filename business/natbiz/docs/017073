<m0>   At Bayfront Park on Thursday, the world's top fast-food chain that has successfully snagged millions of loyal burger-eating, playground-loving kids courted a different market: downtown Miami's yuppie lunch crowd.<ep>
 <m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<m0>  Here and across the United States and Canada, in the most elaborate product introduction in its history, McDonald's debuted its Arch Deluxe sandwich, a fat-rich, premium-priced bacon cheeseburger ``with a grown-up taste'' that the fast-food giant hopes will boost sales among the nation's 78 million baby boomers.<ep>
   ``We've always appealed to families and children,'' said Larry DeVries, McDonald's Boca Raton-based vice president who oversaw Thursday's festive giveaway of more than 1,000 Arch Deluxes and canned sodas. ``We felt we needed to do a little more for adult consumers.''<ep>
   And what better cultural icon to seduce the adult consumer with a discriminating palate and pocketbook than . . . a red-nosed, floppy-shoed clown?<ep>
   As part of the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company's marketing scheme, Ronald McDonald has suddenly matured (--) in behavior, if not fashion sense. In recent TV commercials, Ronald plays golf with the guys, shoots billiards in a pool hall, dances at a nightclub.<ep>
   Thursday, Ronald McDonald donned a hamburger-patterned tie and black-suit jacket to push the Arch Deluxe. ``Ronald's been around for so long he can appeal to people who used to love him when they were small,'' DeVries said.<ep>
   Consider this another battle in the Burger Wars. One that recognizes an aging population and a saturated kiddie market, say restaurant analysts.<ep>
   The fast-food market is ardently competitive, increasingly crowded and, at $50 billion, so massive that even tiny sales victories can translate <m2><ql>

<m0>into big bucks. McDonald's domestic share of that market rose 0.6 percent last year to 42.3 percent, said Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a food industry research and consulting firm in Chicago.<ep>
   But most of that growth came from new stores rather than increased business at existing stores.<ep>
   Miami-based Burger King, McDonald's closest competitor, also gained a 0.6 percent market share last year, up to 18.2 percent.<ep>
   But sales at Burger King's existing stores are way up (--) 12.9 percent in the past two years, company spokeswoman Kim Miller said Thursday.<ep>
   ``McDonald's has got to get current customers to come back more frequently or attract some of their competitors' customers if this is going to work,'' said Paul. ``I think they have all pretty well mined the children's market.''<ep>
   Miller called McDonald's Arch Deluxe marketing campaign ``a reaction to our success.'' About a month ago, Burger King launched a new series of commercials touting specific menu items. ``The idea is to bring customers back into the restaurant,'' she said.<ep>
   In the end, of course, it will be fast-food consumers, a tough lot, who decide whether the Arch Deluxe will succeed or go the way of McDonald's defunct, low-fat McLean Deluxe, which did not catch on despite a health-conscious public and intense marketing.<ep>
   In Bayfront Park, people lined up in the midday sun to try out the Arch Deluxe. They had in common perhaps only one thing: the appetite for a free lunch.<ep>
   ``I don't really understand the concept of this `grown-up taste,' '' said Jairo Arzt, a 22-year-old student at Miami-Dade Community College's Wolfson Campus. He said the Arch Deluxe reminded him of Wendy's hamburgers. ``If it's more than $2, it's not worth it.''<ep>
   Sorry, Jairo, but the Arch Deluxe may cost up to $3 in some markets.<ep>
   And he doesn't buy a grown-up Ronald McDonald. ``It's confusing the public,'' Arzt said. ``They want to cater to all markets but the children will feel neglected and the adults won't get it. It's a mistake.''<ep>
   Other adults like Greg Stewart remember Ronald from their childhood and said they still identify with him and find the new TV commercials fun and effective.<ep>
   Jacob Dorn, 51, who works for Metro-Dade County's real estate office, said ``a free lunch will usually draw me in,'' but hey, it's still just a hamburger.<ep>
   ``We're not talking asparagus and hollandaise here,'' he said. ``Without a significant menu change, I don't see how they're going to capture an additional large percentage of the market.''<ep>
   Nick DeBellis, 22, considers himself a burger connoisseur and really liked the Arch Deluxe. But one thing is still missing, he said.<ep>
   ``Now all McDonald's needs to do is serve beer.''<ep>
