<m0>   Billionaire investor Warren Buffett won shareholder approval for his ``Baby Berkshires'' on Monday (--) and immediately warned people not to expect quick profits from his first new stock in three decades.<ep>
   ``We do not want people to come in and think it's a hot stock and it will be a lot higher in a year,'' said Buffett, who built his reputation (--) and his fortune (--) with a conservative, long-term investment strategy.<ep>
   The new, cheaper class of stock in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. will become Wall Street's second-most expensive issue (--) behind regular Class A Berkshire stock, which sells for $33,800.<ep>
   The so-called Baby Berkshires should be issued Wednesday and are expected to trade a day later on the New York Stock Exchange at about $1,000 a share, Buffett said at Berkshire's annual meeting. That would put it well ahead of what has been the second priciest stock, shares in The Washington Post Co., which were trading Monday at $291.50 each.<ep>
   While hardly bargain-basement priced, the new stock will allow more people to have a chance to own a piece of the legendary investment company, whose stock has quintupled from $6,675 a share so far this decade.<ep>
   Berkshire will offer 350,000 shares of its new stock, and more if there is a greater demand. <m1> <m0>Each class B share will have one-two-hundredth of the vote of a class A share.<ep>

<m0>   Highlighting the tough competition ahead for cable news providers, News Corp. has offered to pay cable system operators about $10 a subscriber for carrying its 24-hour news network.<ep>
   The payment is part of a one-time offer by Rupert Murdoch's media company ahead of the network's launch this fall, a source knowledgeable about the deal said Monday. The proposal is noteworthy because cable operators usually pay program providers, not the other way around.<ep>
   The size of the payments can total hundreds of millions of dollars. For example, Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's biggest cable company, has about 13 million subscribers and No. 2 Time Warner Inc. has more than 11 million.<ep>
   The payment represents one part of a contract the cable operators would sign with News Corp., said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. After the payment, cable operators would begin paying News Corp. according to a standard fee structure.<ep>
   News Corp. declined to confirm the proposal had been made.<ep>

<m0>   May Department Stores Co. completed its spinoff of the Payless ShoeSource Inc. unit by distributing about 40 million Payless shares to its stockholders, the company said Monday.<ep>
   Further terms were not disclosed.<ep>
   In April, St. Louis-based May said it would give its shareholders 16 Payless shares for each 100 May shares held. <m1> <m0>Payless is a Topeka, Kan.-based discount footwear retailer. The company has about 4,500 stores and had sales of about $2.1 billion in 1994.<ep>

<m0>   Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in a month. <m1> <m0>The Treasury Department sold $13.7 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.02 percent, up from 5 percent last week. Another $13.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.14 percent, up from 5.08 percent.<ep>
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said that the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 5.63 percent last week from 5.52 percent the previous week.<ep>

<m0>   Late bargain-hunting helped stocks recover part of their losses Monday, but the broad market ended mostly lower as underlying concerns deepened about rising interest rates and inflation.<ep>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 13.72 points to 5,464.31, rebounding from a loss of 55 earlier in the afternoon. <m1> <m0>The blue-chip index (--) which lost about 90 points last week as new signs of strong economic growth aggravated concerns about inflation and sent long-term interest rates above 7 percent (--) has now fallen 4 percent from its all-time high set just over a month ago.<ep>
   Most broader blue-chip measures were lower too. But in keeping with the recent trend, those indexes dominated by more speculative issues managed some small gains after a late rebound. The Nasdaq composite index gained 1.71 to 1,186.31 and the Russell 2000 list of smaller companies rose 0.02 to 346.87.<ep>
