<H2>Labor Board files complaint vs. nursing home chain</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   Beverly Enterprises Inc. unfairly changed worker health benefits and illegally refused to rehire 350 workers following a three-day strike at 15 Pennsylvania nursing homes, federal labor enforcement authorities charged Friday.<P>

   The National Labor Relations Board made the accusations in an administrative complaint issued against Beverly, the nation's biggest nursing home chain. The complaint seeks to correct the alleged labor law violations and force the company to rehire the workers.<P>

   The complaint is the board's fourth since 1988 and also seeks an order preventing similar unfair labor practices at all 838 of Beverly's homes nationwide.<P>

   A Beverly spokesman accused the labor board of bias in favor of the Service Employees International Union, which has been at odds with the company for months.<P>

<H2>WMX will replace chief</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

      Amid pressure from some unhappy shareholders and Wall Street investors, WMX Technologies Inc. announced Friday that founder Dean Buntrock will be replaced as chief executive.<P>

   Buntrock will remain chairman of the environmental services company, formerly known as Waste Management.<P>

   He will be succeeded June 7 by WMX's president and chief operating officer Phillip R. Rooney. Rooney, 51, will remain president, but will drop the chief operating officer's title.<P>

   Reached after the company's annual shareholder meeting, Rooney said Buntrock was not pressured to retire as the day-to-day leader of the 25-year-old company.<P>

   ``Dean has been thinking about this for several years,'' Rooney said. ``He's turning 65 on June 6 and thought that was a good time to do it.''<P>

   Rumors have circulated on Wall Street for weeks that Buntrock would be replaced after New York financier George Soros took a major stake in the $10 billion international company.<P>

<H2>PepsiCo to give out beepers</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

   PepsiCo is taking an expensive approach to keeping tabs on the teen market: It's offering 500,000 of them beepers.<P>

   The campaign to promote Mountain Dew soft drinks comes at a time when the use of beepers by children is a hot-button issue in school systems nationwide and as consumer activists rail against commercial intrusions into private lives.<P>

   PepsiCo company plans to link teens in a network, beeping teens weekly with discount offers and prize drawings.<P>

   Those who call back on a toll-free number will hear a recording from sports and entertainment celebrities -- including Ken Griffey Jr., Richard Petty and Evel Kneivel. Prizes include personal snowboarding lessons, a trip to MTV's Beach House and recording sessions at Sony studios.<P>

   The offer will cost PepsiCo, Sony, Motorola, MobileComm, MTV and other partners between $40 million and $50 million, according to sources close to the company, who spoke on condition of anonymity.<P>

<H2>PSINet to narrow focus</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

      Underscoring the pressure from big-name companies like AT&T on the Internet business, access provider PSINet Inc. said Friday it will narrow its focus to experienced computer users rather than the mass market.<P>

   In doing so, the company eliminated 85 jobs, about 15 percent of its workforce. Many of the cuts were at the Pipeline Network, a New York-based Internet service it acquired in February 1995.<P>

   The company said it was no longer feasible to target consumers who are virtually unfamiliar with the global data network -- and who often need costly technical support.<P>
