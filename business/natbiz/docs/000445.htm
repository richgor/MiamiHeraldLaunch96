   Highlighting the tough competition ahead for cable news providers, News Corp. has offered to pay cable system operators about $10 a subscriber for carrying its 24-hour news network.<P>

   The payment is part of a one-time offer by Rupert Murdoch's media company ahead of the network's launch this fall, a source knowledgeable about the deal said Monday. The proposal is noteworthy because cable operators usually pay program providers, not the other way around.<P>

   The size of the payments can total hundreds of millions of dollars. For example, Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's biggest cable company, has about 13 million subscribers and No. 2 Time Warner Inc. has more than 11 million.<P>

   The payment represents one part of a contract the cable operators would sign with News Corp., said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. After the payment, cable operators would begin paying News Corp. according to a standard fee structure.<P>

   News Corp. declined to confirm the proposal had been made.<P>

<H2>Spinoff of Payless complete</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

   May Department Stores Co. completed its spinoff of the Payless ShoeSource Inc. unit by distributing about 40 million Payless shares to its stockholders, the company said Monday.<P>

   Further terms were not disclosed.<P>

   In April, St. Louis-based May said it would give its shareholders 16 Payless shares for each 100 May shares held. Payless is a Topeka, Kan.-based discount footwear retailer. The company has about 4,500 stores and had sales of about $2.1 billion in 1994.<P>

<H2>Short-term T-bill rates rise</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in a month. The Treasury Department sold $13.7 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.02 percent, up from 5 percent last week. Another $13.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.14 percent, up from 5.08 percent.<P>

   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said that the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 5.63 percent last week from 5.52 percent the previous week.<P>

THE STOCK MARKET
<!-- start headlines -->
<H2>Dow ends session lower</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

   Late bargain-hunting helped stocks recover part of their losses Monday, but the broad market ended mostly lower as underlying concerns deepened about rising interest rates and inflation.<P>

   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 13.72 points to 5,464.31, rebounding from a loss of 55 earlier in the afternoon. The blue-chip index -- which lost about 90 points last week as new signs of strong economic growth aggravated concerns about inflation and sent long-term interest rates above 7 percent -- has now fallen 4 percent from its all-time high set just over a month ago.<P>

   Most broader blue-chip measures were lower too. But in keeping with the recent trend, those indexes dominated by more speculative issues managed some small gains after a late rebound. The Nasdaq composite index gained 1.71 to 1,186.31 and the Russell 2000 list of smaller companies rose 0.02 to 346.87.<P>
