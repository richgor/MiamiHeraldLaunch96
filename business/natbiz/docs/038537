<m0>   OMAHA, Neb. (--) (AP) (--) Billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., at $33,800 a share Wall Street's most expensive stock, on Monday authorized a new, ``cheaper'' class of stock (--) which will become the second most expensive issue.<ep>
   The so-called Baby Berkshires should be issued Wednesday and are expected to trade a day later on the New York Stock Exchange at about $1,000 a share, Buffett said at Berkshire's annual meeting.<ep>
   That would put it well ahead of what is now the second priciest stock, shares in The Washington Post Co., which were trading Monday at $291.50 each.<ep>
   While hardly bargain-basement priced, the new class B Berkshire stock will allow more investors a chance to own a piece of a legendary conglomerate that has large investments in companies including The Washington Post, Coca-Cola Co., Gillette Co. and Wells Fargo Bank.<ep>
   It also will be the first sale of new shares to the public since Buffett took control of the Omaha-based Berkshire in 1964. He has repeatedly declined to split Berkshire Hathaway shares, something that would lower the price, arguing that cheapening it would encourage speculators who don't share Buffett's strategy of investing for the long term.<ep>
   Stock in Berkshire Hathaway has quintupled so far this decade, which it began at $6,675 a share.<ep>
   Berkshire will offer 350,000 shares of its new stock, and more if there is a greater demand. There is no limit on the number of shares that may be issued.<ep>
Buyers of the new stock won't be in the same boat as the holders of the class A shares, however.<ep>
   Each class B share will have only one-two-hundredth of the vote of a class A share.<ep>
   Also, while each class A share can be converted into 30 class B shares, class B holders won't be able to convert their shares into class A shares.<ep>
