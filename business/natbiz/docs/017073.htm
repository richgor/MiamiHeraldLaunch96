   At Bayfront Park on Thursday, the world's top fast-food chain that has successfully snagged millions of loyal burger-eating, playground-loving kids courted a different market: downtown Miami's yuppie lunch crowd.<P>

 <BR>
  Here and across the United States and Canada, in the most elaborate product introduction in its history, McDonald's debuted its Arch Deluxe sandwich, a fat-rich, premium-priced bacon cheeseburger ``with a grown-up taste'' that the fast-food giant hopes will boost sales among the nation's 78 million baby boomers.<P>

   ``We've always appealed to families and children,'' said Larry DeVries, McDonald's Boca Raton-based vice president who oversaw Thursday's festive giveaway of more than 1,000 Arch Deluxes and canned sodas. ``We felt we needed to do a little more for adult consumers.''<P>

   And what better cultural icon to seduce the adult consumer with a discriminating palate and pocketbook than . . . a red-nosed, floppy-shoed clown?<P>

   As part of the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company's marketing scheme, Ronald McDonald has suddenly matured -- in behavior, if not fashion sense. In recent TV commercials, Ronald plays golf with the guys, shoots billiards in a pool hall, dances at a nightclub.<P>

   Thursday, Ronald McDonald donned a hamburger-patterned tie and black-suit jacket to push the Arch Deluxe. ``Ronald's been around for so long he can appeal to people who used to love him when they were small,'' DeVries said.<P>

   Consider this another battle in the Burger Wars. One that recognizes an aging population and a saturated kiddie market, say restaurant analysts.<P>

   The fast-food market is ardently competitive, increasingly crowded and, at $50 billion, so massive that even tiny sales victories can translate into big bucks. McDonald's domestic share of that market rose 0.6 percent last year to 42.3 percent, said Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a food industry research and consulting firm in Chicago.<P>

   But most of that growth came from new stores rather than increased business at existing stores.<P>

   Miami-based Burger King, McDonald's closest competitor, also gained a 0.6 percent market share last year, up to 18.2 percent.<P>

   But sales at Burger King's existing stores are way up -- 12.9 percent in the past two years, company spokeswoman Kim Miller said Thursday.<P>

   ``McDonald's has got to get current customers to come back more frequently or attract some of their competitors' customers if this is going to work,'' said Paul. ``I think they have all pretty well mined the children's market.''<P>

   Miller called McDonald's Arch Deluxe marketing campaign ``a reaction to our success.'' About a month ago, Burger King launched a new series of commercials touting specific menu items. ``The idea is to bring customers back into the restaurant,'' she said.<P>

   In the end, of course, it will be fast-food consumers, a tough lot, who decide whether the Arch Deluxe will succeed or go the way of McDonald's defunct, low-fat McLean Deluxe, which did not catch on despite a health-conscious public and intense marketing.<P>

   In Bayfront Park, people lined up in the midday sun to try out the Arch Deluxe. They had in common perhaps only one thing: the appetite for a free lunch.<P>

   ``I don't really understand the concept of this `grown-up taste,' '' said Jairo Arzt, a 22-year-old student at Miami-Dade Community College's Wolfson Campus. He said the Arch Deluxe reminded him of Wendy's hamburgers. ``If it's more than $2, it's not worth it.''<P>

   Sorry, Jairo, but the Arch Deluxe may cost up to $3 in some markets.<P>

   And he doesn't buy a grown-up Ronald McDonald. ``It's confusing the public,'' Arzt said. ``They want to cater to all markets but the children will feel neglected and the adults won't get it. It's a mistake.''<P>

   Other adults like Greg Stewart remember Ronald from their childhood and said they still identify with him and find the new TV commercials fun and effective.<P>

   Jacob Dorn, 51, who works for Metro-Dade County's real estate office, said ``a free lunch will usually draw me in,'' but hey, it's still just a hamburger.<P>

   ``We're not talking asparagus and hollandaise here,'' he said. ``Without a significant menu change, I don't see how they're going to capture an additional large percentage of the market.''<P>

   Nick DeBellis, 22, considers himself a burger connoisseur and really liked the Arch Deluxe. But one thing is still missing, he said.<P>

   ``Now all McDonald's needs to do is serve beer.''
