  NEW YORK -- Some investors in Triarc Cos. say they are about to be rewarded for their patience.<P>

   After years trying to stitch together unrelated businesses, Triarc has found its focus: the consumer. It's selling off propane and textiles operations so that it can concentrate on building up its Arby's restaurant and RC Cola businesses, both based in Fort Lauderdale.<P>

   And the story could get better. With the recent upheaval in the soft-drink industry, RC might end up in a major alliance with -- or be sold -- to Cadbury Schweppes.<P>

   On Monday, New York-based Triarc completed the sale of its Graniteville textile business for $255 million in cash. Later this month, it expects to sell about half its National Propane unit in an initial public offering, clearing more than $100 million.<P>

   Those steps will simplify the company for investors and give it money to reinvest in restaurants and beverages, including the recently purchased Mistic line, said Triarc President Peter May.<P>

   ``Our objective is to build the remaining businesses,'' he said.<P>

   If that comes to pass, its lagging shares should benefit handsomely. They've fallen from a high of $33 in late 1993 to close at $13 Friday.<P>

   Part of the problem has been the company's losses in five of the last seven quarters, which grew to $1.30 a share in the fourth quarter after a charge.<P>

   But that could change; on Thursday, it reported profits from operations of 6 cents a share in the first quarter, exceeding the 3-cent average estimate of three analysts surveyed by IBES International.<P>

   ``People want to see the operating numbers,'' said William Ehrman of EGS Partners, owner of more than 600,000 Triarc shares. ``And the first quarter will show terrific improvement in Arby's and RC Cola.''<P>

   And going ahead, the balance sheet will be far stronger with the asset sales, which could continue if Triarc disposes of its dye business.<P>

   ``Every quarter this year will be above consensus'' profit estimates, said Ehrman, one of Triarc's largest outside holders.<P>

   Investors have waited a long time for May and Chairman and Chief Executive Nelson Peltz to unload some of the businesses cobbled together by Miami corporate raider Victor Posner. Peltz and May took majority control in April 1993.<P>

   With so many businesses, something was frequently wrong at one of them. Last year, for example, RC Cola suffered when sales of concentrate to Cott Corp., king of the private-label soda business, fell off.<P>

   But the company regrouped with the introduction of Royal Crown Draft, an expensive cola, and by purchasing Mistic and relaunching its ``new age'' line of beverages.<P>

   Triarc also has a plan for Arby's, where it will spend heavily to convert some of the fast-food chain's stores to Roast Towns, a family-style restaurant that features food to be eaten at home.<P>

   ``For a while, there was little product development,'' said Dennis Lombardi at Technomic, a restaurant consulting firm. ``Now, they seem more in tune.''<P>

   Dual branding partnerships with ZuZu, a Mexican restaurant chain, and P.T. Noodle, a pasta chain, will help fill up the stores, May figures. Arby's has about 3,000 restaurants worldwide, about 2,600 of which are franchised.<P>

   That should drive sales per store to better than $1 million yearly from $700,000, he said.<P>

   ``That is going to be the thrust of our capital spending over the next couple of years,'' May said. ``We like the restaurant business, we think we have a sensational management team, and we are leveraging the existing assets.''<P>

   Triarc could also reap a windfall, analysts say, from the chaos in U.S. soft-drink bottling.<P>

   After British candy and soda maker Cadbury Schweppes bought Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo began pressing their bottlers to stop producing beverages for Cadbury, now the No. 3 U.S. soft-drink company.<P>

   Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world's largest Coke bottler, in March dropped Cadbury's A&W Root Beer, Welch's and Sunkist brands, and industry experts think Cadbury could soon lose the right to distribute Coke in the United Kingdom.<P>

   If that happens, Cadbury might want RC Cola to take Coke's place in its lineup -- either through a licensing agreement or a straight purchase.<P>

   ``Cola is a major percentage of total beverage sales, and Triarc happens to own a very good brand,'' said Michael Bunyaner, who follows Triarc for Oppenheimer & Co. ``It makes sense. If you want to speculate, go ahead.''<P>

   Cadbury isn't exactly leaping to quash the speculation.<P>

   ``Our strategy is certainly one that focuses on the non-cola category,'' said U.S. spokeswoman Catherine Van Evans. ``At the present time, it's our intent to move forward with that strategy.''<P>

   Should that change, Triarc holders will be in position to lap up the rewards.
