<m0>   For Frank J. Biondi Jr., being fired as chief executive of Viacom Inc. might prove to be one of the most profitable events of his career.<ep>
   Not only did he get an undisclosed settlement for leaving Viacom, but Seagram Co., which hired him away to become chief executive of its MCA division, has given him a five-year contract that is valued at $76 million by Graef Crystal, an independent compensation consultant.<ep>
   Provisions of his employment contract were filed last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which requires such filings when executives are named to a company's board. Biondi was named to Seagram's <m4>Biondi<m2><ql>
<m0>board.<ep>
   According to the terms of his contract, Biondi will receive a salary of $1 million a year over five years. He will also receive deferred compensation of $300,000 a year in that period. By keeping his base salary at $1 million, the company is able to treat the salary as tax deductible; a base salary of more than $1 million is not tax deductible.<ep>
   Biondi will also receive a bonus of $4.5 million annually that could go as high as $9 million depending on inflation and the performance of MCA, which is the parent company of the studio Universal Pictures and Universal Television. That brings his salary and bonus total to $51.5 million.<ep>
   In addition, he will get a one-time grant of a million 10-year options that give him the right, but not the obligation, to buy Seagram stock at the market value as of April 23 (--) which was $33.75. Crystal valued those options at roughly $10.5 million.<ep>
   Biondi also will get an opportunity to buy 500,000 options at 140 percent of their fair market value as of last Friday. Seagram closed Friday at $32.875 a share, so the exercise price of the option is $46.025 a share. These options can be exercised over five years in equal installments. Crystal valued that provision at $3.5 million.<ep>
   In addition, Biondi will get another one-million 10-year option granted at the rate of $200,000 a year over the five-year period. Those Crystal also valued at $10.5 million, bringing Biondi's total compensation to $76 million.<ep>
   But, depending on Seagram's stock performance, the options could prove far more or far less valuable. ``Certainly the entertainment industry is environmentally correct,'' said Crystal. ``Executives are recycled regularly and generally at an increase in pay.''<ep>
   Indeed, Biondi earned an average of $12 million a year between 1992 and 1994. That payment included his salary, long-term compensation and stock options. His 1995 salary is not yet known because the company's proxy has not been filed.<ep>
   How does he compare to his colleagues? He did not do quite as well as Ted Turner, who is scheduled to become vice chairman of Time Warner Inc., if the company's acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System is approved. Turner will receive a package that Crystal valued at roughly $110 million in stock, bonus and option.<ep>
   As for Michael Ovitz, who is now president of Walt Disney Co., his pay package was valued at roughly $96 million, Crystal said. But Ovitz, unlike his two counterparts, will get a package based far more heavily on the performance of his company's stock.<ql>
