   Peppered with criticism for spurning buyout overtures from Hercules Inc., W.R. Grace Chairman Albert Costello told shareholders at the company's annual meeting Friday that Grace's board hasn't ruled out the possibility of merging with a company with ``product synergies.''<P>

   Several shareholders in the audience of 500 expressed disappointment that Grace didn't pursue a pitch from Hercules Chairman Thomas Gossage that Hercules acquire Grace. Gossage's proposal cost him his position as a Grace director in March. He has since reiterated that Hercules and Grace would make a good fit, while engaging in confidential talks with two other companies.<P>

   Costello, who joined Boca Raton-based Grace one year ago amid a front-office sex scandal and shareholder unrest, was rankled by the suggestion that he was negligent in representing shareholder interests.<P>

   ``We've had no discussions with him, and he's made no proposal,'' Costello said of Gossage. ``If Gossage makes an offer in the press, that's a hostile bid. I see no need to talk with Gossage about a merger with his company when we have no product synergies at all.''<P>

   Takeover speculation helped drive up the price of Grace shares to $83 in April. The stock has since cooled off, closing at $74.75 Friday, up 25 cents a share.<P>

   Nonetheless, investors and analysts still suspect Costello has an ace up his sleeve. ``One can theorize that ever since Gossage made a pass at him, Costello could be looking at other companies as a white knight,'' said Bear Stearns analyst Jeff Cianci.<P>

   Costello wouldn't say if he's talking with other companies. He emphasized that his main concern is leading Grace into high-growth businesses with good profit margins. He said the sale of three business units, including National Medical Care, will raise $3 billion to reduce debt, buy back stock and make capital investments.<P>

   ``If I can create value by staying in a <BR>
business, I'll do that. If I can't, I'll sell it,'' Costello told reporters after the meeting. ``I may be old, but I'm not old-fashioned and I never wanted to be a manager who was entrenched. If I can't make my contribution in four years, I'm not going to make it.''<P>

   National Medical Care, whose $2.1 billion in sales accounted for 36 percent of Grace's revenue last year, is being spun off to a new company controlled by Fresenius AG, a German maker of kidney dialysis equipment. Grace shareholders will own 45 percent of the new company and will receive their shares in the form of a tax-free dividend.
