<m0>   Having gotten their Easter shopping out of the way in March, many consumers took it a little easier during April, leaving retailers with mixed sales results for the month.<ep>
   Retail industry analysts, who consider March and April figures together before assessing how well the stores are doing, said sales indicated the overall retail climate is improving slowly after the disaster of Christmas 1995.<ep>
   The big storeowners had widely divergent numbers, with the nation's biggest merchant, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announcing same-store sales dipped slightly, down 0.6 percent, and No. 2 Sears, Roebuck and Co. posting a big gain (--) 10.9 percent.<ep>
   ``They're all over the fence,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.<ep>
   Feiner said unseasonably cold weather nipped into sales. But some apparel retailers, who are particularly vulnerable to the vagaries of the weather, had a good month. Gap Inc., in particular, had very strong sales (--) a 9 percent gain.<ep>
   But Feiner and analyst Terrence McEvoy of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. saw gradual improvement in the underlying tone of business. McEvoy labeled the numbers decent, with retailers selling merchandise for the home faring the best.<ep>
   The Salomon Brothers retail index, the investment firm's barometer of sales performance, rose 1.3 percent after a 5.4 percent gain in March. In April 1995, the index rose 7 percent.<ep>
   Kmart Corp. reported a 0.2 percent same-store gain. Federated Department Stores Inc. said same-store sales fell 1.1 percent. <m1>  <m0>Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's strength.<ep>

<m0>   Ford Motor Co. asked a judge Thursday to overturn a $62.4 million jury verdict against the automaker, charging that two auto safety experts rigged tests to support allegations its Bronco IIs were unsafe. Last October's verdict in Marion Superior Court held that Ford was negligent in the serious injury of two Indiana women hurt in a rollover of the Bronco II, a sport-utility vehicle discontinued in 1990.<ep>
   Ford on Thursday asked Marion Superior Court Judge David Rimstidt to order a new trial, citing allegedly misleading testimony from auto safety experts Dr. Michael Kaplan and Robert Hooker, spokesman Jon Harmon said. <m1>  <m0>Ford accused Kaplan and Hooker of deliberately steering the Bronco II in a way to ensure a rollover.<ep>
   Kaplan on Thursday denied Ford's allegations. <m1>  <m0>He said lawyers in the case used results from prior tests his company had conducted on four Bronco IIs (--) all of which tipped over during emergency maneuvers.<ep>

<m0>   Procter & Gamble Co. settled its lawsuit against Bankers Trust New York Corp. over $200 million in losses from derivatives, ending a two-year legal battle.<ep>
   P&G, in a statement, said the settlement includes an agreement to pay $35 million of $200 million it owed Bankers Trust. The bank will absorb the remaining losses, P&G said.<ep>
   ``We are pleased with this settlement and are glad to have this issue resolved,'' said John E. Pepper, P&G chairman and chief executive.<ep>
   Bankers Trust Chairman Frank Newman, in a statement, said the settlement eliminates the last remaining dispute with a client over losses on derivatives, ``and we have done so in a way that serves the interests of all the concerned parties.''<ep>

<m0>    Stocks managed slight gains Thursday as persistent concerns about interest rates and inflation wiped out any momentum from Wednesday's dramatic turnaround.<ep>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose just 1.08 points to 5,475.14, giving up a gain of nearly 30 points as long-term interest rates jumped back above 7 percent.<ep>
   Some analysts attributed Thursday's renewed weakness in bonds to concerns about a report due Friday on inflation in wholesale prices, as well as next week's economic reports, including Tuesday's figures on consumer prices.<ep>
   ``There's been some profit-taking and positioning in front of the next economic data. There's a fair amount of uncertainty,'' said Dean A. Gulis, director of research for Roney & Co. in Detroit.<ep>
  Broader market indexes also rose.<ql>

<m0>   Warren Buffett's new class of common shares changed hands on their first day of trading at a pace that was brisk by his company's standards.<ep>
   The new Class B shares of his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., also climbed as much as 9.9 percent from their offering price and traded at a premium of more than 7 percent above the old shares, now designated as Class A stock.<ep>
   While Buffett wasn't available to comment on the trading, statements he made at the company's annual meeting earlier this week suggested he couldn't have been happy about it.<ep>
   Buffett, Berkshire's chairman, said he would be ``very disappointed'' if the Class B shares were a ``hot stock'' on their first day, and if the trading was high relative to the amount sold.<ep>
   Berkshire's Class B closed Thursday at $1,160 a share, up $50, or 4.5 percent. Because each of the shares represents 1/30th of a Class A share, the closing price was equivalent to $34,950 per Class A share. The latter closed at $35,000, up $1,600.<ql>
