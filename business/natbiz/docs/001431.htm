  Alamo Rent-A-Car said Friday it reduced first-quarter losses from $29 million to $12 million, and executives predicted the company would show a profit for the year.<P>

  ``In a seasonally slow first quarter, we had a $17 million improvement and we operated ahead of plan,'' said Roger Ballou, Alamo chief operating officer. ``If we execute the plan from here on, we'll make a profit.''<P>

  Ballou said Fort Lauderdale-based Alamo's fleet size fell 2 percent in the first quarter to about 120,000 cars, reducing its carrying charges. In addition, the company has cut $10 million out of its annual marketing budget by moving from national TV advertising to spot TV, local newspapers and local radio. ``With newspapers and radio, we can be more rapid in response,'' Ballou said. ``TV takes lead time.''<P>

  Alamo publicly reported quarterly results for the first time Friday because the company raised $100 million in a public bond offering in February and must conform to Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements.<P>

  The company also disclosed Friday that it lost $49.6 million during 1995. Although it broke even on operations after the first quarter loss, Alamo took $20 million in one-time restructuring charges during the third and fourth quarters.<P>

   Alamo was not the only rental squeezed last year. The industry saw sharp increases in car costs, while intense competition prevented rate increases.    This year, the state of the rental car industry has improved substantially due to improved pricing, airline industry traffic growth, reduced increases in car prices and stability in industry fleet size.<P>

   Alamo is the fourth-largest rental car company, but the largest in the leisure market, which accounts for 70 percent of its business. Its growth strategy includes expansion into the local, non-airport market, where people rent cars for weekend getaways or because their cars are in the shop, and in Europe. Alamo is also seeking to improve service, including 25-second processing for repeat customers.<BR>

Mastec<BR>
<P>

  Mastec Inc., a telecommunications company headquartered in Miami, reported a 50 percent jump in income from continuing operations for the first quarter ending March 31. Earnings rose $2.5 million or 15 cents a share in the first quarter of 1995 to $3.7 million or 23 cents a share in the same period in 1996. Net income, including income from discontinued operations, fell 11.5 percent, from $4.2 million in the first quarter of 1995 to $3.6 million in 1996. Revenue for the period shot up 80 percent, from $34.6 million in last year's first quarter to $62.5 million this year. Mastec president and chief executive Jorge Mas said internal expansion and domestic acquisitions contributed to the first quarter results. The April 1 acquisition of Sistemas e Instalaciones de Telecomunicacion from Telefonica de Espana is expected to boost growth in the future.<BR>

Fresh Del Monte Produce<BR>
<P>

  Fresh Del Monte Produce, a producer and distributor of fresh fruits and vegetables headquartered in Coral Gables, reported earnings sank to $100,000 in its first quarter 1996, from $11.7 million in the same quarter last year. The fall in net income stemmed from problems plaguing the entire industry: lower prices in Pacific countries, higher fuel costs and flooding in Costa Rica. But Fresh Del Monte's earnings drop surpassed those experienced by competitors Chiquita Brands International and Dole Food. Fresh Del Monte is up for sale and a decision by a steering committee of Mexican financial authorities and company executives is expected by the end of the month.<BR>

Noven Pharmaceuticals<BR>
<P>

 Noven Pharmaceuticals of Miami saw its shares rise on Wall Street optimism that wider distribution of the company's estrogen replacement patch will dramatically improve future financial results.<P>

  Noven's shares rose 87 cents to close at $14.12, even though the Miami drug firm posted a greater-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter. Four analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted a loss of 2 cents per share.<P>

  The company may turn its first profit ever next quarter, some analysts predict. <P>

  Noven's shares are on the rise following news of product approvals in the Ukraine and Russia and its licensing agreement with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.<P>

  The stock price boost also reflects analysts' optimism because Noven recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its new manufacturing plant, after a long wait, some analysts said.<P>

  Ciba-Geigy AG holds U.S. rights to distribute the estrogen patches, designed to treat unpleasant side effects of menopause in women, including hot flashes and vaginal dryness.<BR>
