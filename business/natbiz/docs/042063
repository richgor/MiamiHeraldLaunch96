<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) Raising antitrust concerns, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission is recommending that the $7.5 billion proposed merger of Time Warner Inc. and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. be reworked.<ep>
   The regulators' staff is concerned that the deal, which would create the world's largest media and entertainment company, would hurt competition by giving the merged company too much control over cable programming, attorneys close to the matter said Tuesday.<ep>
   The objections are significant, ``more than just posturing,'' said one of the attorneys, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.<ep>
   Dow Jones News Service reported that the FTC staff was preparing a recommendation that the full commission block the deal. The Washington Post reported that the staff had reached a general consensus to either oppose the transaction or call for substantial changes.<ep>
   Attorneys close to the proposed merger could not confirm that. The FTC <m1><styl>cxon<ql>

   The agency's commissioners ultimately have the power to reject or approve the merger announced last September.<ep>
   Consumer groups, cable television competitors and telephone companies have asked the FTC to look closely at the cable programming issue. Opponents say the new Time Warner-Turner company could block rivals from carrying programs on cable, via satellite and over telephone lines.<ep>
   The FTC also is concerned about provisions in the deal related to Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable company, attorneys said.<ep>
   TCI now owns 21 percent of Turner. But the deal calls for TCI's stake to be reduced to about 9 percent and placed in a trust. Time Warner would get TCI's voting power.<ep>
   In return, TCI would get numerous concessions, including long-term agreements to carry Turner cable networks at favorable rates and the right to buy Turner's interest in SportsSouth, a regional sports cable network, for $60 million.<ep>
   The Consumer Federation of America says the deal would give the merged company access to cable TV systems covering 46 percent of all cable customers nationwide. That estimate includes TCI's cable systems.<ep>
   Time Warner owns HBO, the most popular pay-TV channel. Turner owns CNN, TBS, TNT and Headline News, all among the 15 most widely distributed cable networks.<ep>
   Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin said last week he is confident the merger will go through and be completed by September.<ep>
   TCI Senior Vice President Bob Thomson said TCI attorneys will have continuing conversations with the FTC in support of the deal.<ep>
   ``We do not believe that significant changes need to be made in the existing agreement,'' Thomson said. ``Having said that, we believe the agreement will ultimately be approved.''<ep>
   Phone calls to Time Warner and Turner were not immediately returned.<ep>
