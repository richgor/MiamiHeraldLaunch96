<m0>   The rush to stash cash into individual retirement accounts at the end of tax season made April a great month for equity mutual funds, according to an estimate from the Investment Company Institute, a Washington, D.C., mutual-fund association.<ep>
   The estimate, released Wednesday, said mutual funds in April probably took in a net $23 billion. That's up slightly from March's $22.3 billion, which included some help from bond and income funds, which the ICI estimates netted no new cash in April. If that estimate holds, equity inflows in April may beat March's $20.5 billion and may be second only to the record $28.9 billion equity inflow in January. <m1> <m0>Net inflows are total new sales minus redemptions, not including dividends.<ep>
   Global and international equity funds attracted most of the new cash in April, according to John Rea, the ICI's chief economist.<ep>
   The ICI estimates support claims from many fund companies in late April that the 1996 IRA season was the best ever. T. Rowe Price Associates had expected April inflows to beat $1 billion for only the third time. (The first two billion-dollar months were this January and February.) T. Rowe and other fund companies also support the ICI's report that international and global funds were the big draws and bond funds the big zero.<ep>

<m0>   Retail pharmacies could get discounts on prescription medicines just like HMOs under a revised settlement of a price-fixing lawsuit that received a judge's preliminary approval on Wednesday.<ep>
   While it is uncertain how the deal would affect consumers, one possible outcome is a system in which pharmacies mimic HMOs, banding together to provide discount drug benefits programs, some industry experts predicted.<ep>
   ``Here's where the new frontier is,'' said David Melnick, an attorney who represented pharmacies in the price-fixing lawsuit against drug manufacturers.<ep>
   Melnick predicted that pharmacies will offer benefits programs to insurance companies and major employers that insure themselves and want the convenience of a maximum number of retail outlets. <m1> <m0>That could qualify the druggists for discounts from the pharmaceutical manufacturers, as agreed to in the lawsuit settlement.<ep>
   Melnick helped broker the new deal with the drug manufacturers when U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras rejected a $408.9 million settlement last month because it didn't address discounting practices.<ep>
   The new deal would pay the druggists $351.3 million, the decrease due in part to the refusal of Ciby-Geigy Corp. and Abbott Laboratories to go along with 11 other defendants in the new deal. But more importantly from the pharmacies' perspective, manufacturers have agreed to offer the discounts they now grant to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and mail-order pharmaceutical concerns, based on the pharmacies' ability to convince their customers to shift brands of drugs.<ep>

<m0>   Yields on 10-year Treasury notes rose in Wednesday's auction to the highest level in 15 months as the government continued its quarterly refunding. <m1>  <m0>The average yield was 6.902 percent, up from 5.649 percent at the last auction on Feb. 7, 1996. It was the highest since 10-year notes sold for 7.54 percent on Feb. 8, 1995. <m1> <m0>The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 6 7/8 percent with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,980.70.<ep>

<m0>   America Online Inc. had a busy morning Wednesday: It announced a deal to create an on-line service in Japan, better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter, plus plans to slow down marketing for the summer and to introduce discounts for heavy users.<ep>
   Wall Street mulled the news, and by day's end knocked the company's stock down $7.25 to close at $62.75.<ep>
   Analysts were divided as to why. The stock ``had gone up a lot over the last couple days,'' noted Michael K. Parekh, an industry analyst with securities firm Goldman Sachs & Co. in New York, who said the stock was simply returning to a more-rational level. Other analysts saw the decline as driven by fears that the company, which has seen helter-skelter growth in the last year, is about to take a breather.<ep>

<m0>  Lawyers for the former head of Venezuela's Banco Latino, Gustavo Gomez Lopez, have filed a complaint against the Venezuelan government with the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights in Washington. The complaint charges the government of President Rafael Caldera with depriving Gomez Lopez of his rights to fair and humane treatment and freedom from arbitrary arrest.<ep>
   Venezuelan authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Gomez Lopez for his involvement in the 1994 failure of Banco Latino, then the country's second largest bank. Gomez Lopez's whereabouts are unknown.<ep>
   Gomez Lopez's complaint charges that he has been unfairly blamed for country's economic crisis and that his rights were violated by the arrest warrant issued for actions that were legal and generally accepted Venezuelan banking practices.<ql>
