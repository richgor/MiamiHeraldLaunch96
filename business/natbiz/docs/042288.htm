   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Computer Inc. on Monday licensed its Macintosh operating system to International Business Machines Corp., in an effort to prop up its shrinking market share.<P>

   Apple kept its system to itself until 1994, when it began awarding licenses to a few clone makers. Most other personal computer makers use Intel Corp. chips and Microsoft Corp.'s operating system, a standard set by IBM.<P>

   With a market share of less than 8 percent last year, Apple needs to get more Mac systems in use so software developers will continue to produce new applications.<P>

   ``This will help Apple expand the low end of the market, and that is where they have had problems,'' said analyst Vadim Zlotnikov of Sanford Bernstein & Co. Apple's high-end desktop publishing machines have been in higher demand, while it had more low-end PCs in stores than consumers wanted.<P>

   The agreement puts IBM's clout behind Apple. Many computer makers were reluctant to go against the world's largest computer maker, even though Apple's system was considered technically superior and easier to use.<P>

   It doesn't go as far as some people would have liked, though. IBM itself won't make any Mac clones. Instead, it will sublicense the system to other, small computer makers.<P>

   ``It's not IBM making a PC with the Mac OS,'' said analyst Barry Bosak of Smith Barney. ``It's not the plus it could be.''<P>

   Apple is driving for a turnaround this year, working to slim product lines, cut its workforce and return to profitability in the next 12 months. It has been pummeled by problems in the past year, including executive turmoil, declining demand and a $740 million loss in the fiscal second quarter, its largest ever.<P>

   Apple will receive a royalty on each license awarded through IBM, as if it were licensing the system itself each time.<P>

   Apple shares rose $1.75 to $25.62 1/2, while IBM shares fell $1.12 1/2 to $107.<P>

For IBM, the agreement means more sales of the PowerPC chip that it jointly developed with Apple and Motorola Inc. The chip, used in Macintoshes, is the equivalent of Intel's high-powered Pentium. IBM and Motorola both make the chips, which Apple buys from them.<P>

   For clone makers, the agreement means they can go to IBM for hardware, support and software, instead of dealing with separate suppliers.<P>

   ``It's one-stop shopping,'' said Michael Attardo, general manager of IBM Microelectronics, noting that he expects to be able to speed the growth of the PowerPC and Mac market.
