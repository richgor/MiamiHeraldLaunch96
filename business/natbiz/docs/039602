<m0>   NEW YORK (--) (AP) (--) Sales for the nation's top black-owned businesses rose 11.8 percent last year, outperforming both the Fortune 500 and Forbes 500 lists, Black Enterprise magazine reports in its annual ranking.<ep>
   Businesses listed in the magazine's June edition, which hits newsstands May 21, showed continued growth for the fourth straight year.<ep>
   Revenue for companies on Fortune's list grew only 9.9 percent, and Forbes tallied only 10 percent growth among its top 500 companies.<ep>
   The Black Enterprise listing reported total revenues for the 100 largest industrial and service companies and 100 auto dealerships of $13.1 billion, a nearly 12 percent increase over the $11.7 billion reported last year.<ep>
   That's about equal to sales for Dallas-based Texas Instruments, which ranks 89th on the Fortune 500 list.<ep>
   ``The key word for BE 100s companies was innovation (--) striving to meet their entrepreneurial mission in ways that they may not have considered or attempted in the past,'' Black Enterprise executive editor Alfred Edmond Jr. said in a statement.<ep>
   Revenues for top industrial and service companies ranged from $18.3 million for General Scientific Corp., an engineering company in Arlington, Va., to $2.1 billion for TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. The New York-based food processor and distributor maintained the top ranking it held last year.<ep>
      Michigan hosts the most businesses on the list with 23, followed by Illinois (17), New York (15), Texas (15), Virginia (14), California (13), Georgia (11), Maryland (11) and Ohio (10).<ep>
   Florida hosts only one company on the top 100 list. Solo Construction Corp. of North Miami Beach, <m1>   <m0>a general engineering and construction firm with $28.1 million in sales last year, ranked No. 71.<ep>
   As the national unemployment rate was slightly lower at the end of the year, annual payrolls at top black-owned businesses rose 6.6 percent to 42,386 industrial and service workers and 8,671 auto dealership employees.<ep>
   Al Smith Chevrolet-Oldsmobile of Brighton, Colo., usurped the top ranking among auto dealers, which are listed separately, that was held in 1994 by Warner Robins Oldsmobile-Cadillac-Pontiac-GMC Truck Inc. of Warner Robins, Ga.<ep>
   There were 26 new companies on the list in 1995, nine of them industrial and service firms and 17 auto dealerships.<ep>
