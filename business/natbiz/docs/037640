<styl>by <m0>By EDWIN McDOWELL<ql>
<m1><styl>crline <m0>New York Times Service<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  COLUMBIA, S.C. (--) After he was appointed regional manager for the McInnes Steel Co. in January, Daryl Boe planned on staying in a motel while he looked for an apartment.<ep>
   ``But I was driving by here and saw a sign on a new building saying $189 a week,'' the 29-year-old Boe said, ``so I stopped to check it out, and here I am.''<ep>
   ``Here'' is a 120-unit Extended Stay America, an economy hotel for people intending to bunk down not just for a few nights but for weeks or even months. And the guests aren't the usual mix of free-spending tourists and expense-account sales executives who populate pricier hotels.<ep>
   Rather, Extended Stay and a host of other new chains like it cater to the nation's rising number of penny-pinching corporate nomads (--) workers who are looking for jobs, workers who have been relocated, workers who are being retrained after their old jobs were abolished, and the legions of consultants who are advising them all.<ep>
   Extended-stay lodging has been around since at least the 1970s. But what differentiates the new wave of providers are the average lengths of stay, from weeks to months, and the lower room rates. By offering comfortable, homelike living conditions at bargain-basement rates, they have become the hottest sector in an industry that is just starting to emerge from the doldrums.<ep>
   Fort Lauderdale-based Extended Stay went public in December at $13 a share, raising $57.2 million for the company whose principal shareholders are Republic Industries Chairman and former Blockbuster chief H. Wayne Huizenga and former Blockbuster officer George Johnson Jr. Shares closed Tuesday at $26.37 1/2. The company's annual meeting is at 11 a.m. Thursday <m1> <m0>at the Parker Playhouse in Fort Lauderdale.<ep>
   Boe's setup helps explain the popularity of the extended-stay concept. With his laptop computer and printer, and his access to the hotel's fax machine, he has transformed his room into an office.<ep>
   And, until he finds an apartment, he is making it into a home away from home. Boe feels free to rearrange the furniture and even redecorate. And though Boe's culinary skills are nonexistent, he likes being able to save on restaurant bills by popping frozen dinners in the microwave and storing yogurt, orange juice and other perishables in the refrigerator.<ep>
   ``I'm on an expense account,'' he said, ``but I don't see the sense of costing my company $75 to $80 a night for <m2><ql>

<m0>a room when this is just fine for less than $30 a night.''<ep>
   The new extended-stay rooms are often bigger than standard hotel rooms and they typically offer separate working and sleeping areas, refrigerators, microwaves, dishwashers, sinks with garbage-disposal machines, dishes and kitchen utensils and coffee makers. They also have desks with multiple phone lines and voice mail.<ep>
<m0>Weekly housekeeping<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   But they eliminate minor luxuries like plastic wrappings on glasses. And instead of daily maid service, they offer weekly housekeeping with twice-weekly towel service, and coin laundromats on the premises.<ep>
   To hold down costs even more, front desks at Extended Stay America and another extended-stay property, Studio Plus, are unattended late at night. Mainstay Suites, the new extended-stay brand of Choice Hotels International, will substitute an automated check-in system for the traditional 24-hour front desk.<ep>
   Studio Plus properties are run with five employees, about one for every 15 rooms, and Extended Stay Americas with 10 or fewer mostly part-time workers, or one for every 12 rooms. In contrast, full-service hotels employ about two people for every three rooms.<ep>
   Choice plans to spend $100 million for 10 Mainstay Suites by the end of next year, with 25 planned by the year 2000. Marriott, Hilton, Holiday Inn, Doubletree, Summerfield and Wyndham are all trotting out their own versions, with plans for hundreds of such properties in the next few years. And Jack DeBoer, the founder of Residence Inns, one of the earliest extended-stay chains, which has since been acquired by Marriott, is joining with Doubletree to start a new low-priced chain called Candlewood.<ep>
   With seven properties in operation and 21 under construction, Extended Stay plans to open 300 more by the year 2000.<ep>
   Studio Plus has offered extended-stay properties since 1985, but still has only 25 in eight states, mostly in the South. But it raised almost $150 million in two recent stock offerings, and now plans to have 100 properties by the end of 1998.<ep>
<m0>Rapid growth<m2><ql>
<m1><ql>
<ep>
<m0>   The growth of extended stay in just the last couple of years has surprised the industry. Last year, travelers staying five or more nights at all hotels (other than for conventions) accounted for more than 30 percent of all room nights, compared with about 26 percent in 1993, according to D.K. Shifflet & Associates, a marketing group in McLean, Va.<ep>
   Marriott's Towneplace Suites, designed for stays of a month or longer, will have full kitchens, and the rates will range between $45 and $60 a day, well below the average $80 at its Residence Inns.<ep>
   Marriott also plans to develop and franchise as many as 100 Fairfield Suites, designed for budget business travelers staying up to four nights. The first of those properties is under construction in Plano, Tex., near Dallas' high-tech corporations, which by continuously moving and retraining their employees, are expected to keep occupancy rates high.<ep>
   Many of the newer extended-stay properties are being placed not along highways or in downtown business districts, but in cheaper locations near training centers, corporate headquarters or industrial parks. Studio Plus, whose guests stay an average of five weeks, largely looks for locations near residential areas.<ep>
   ``We have linoleum in the kitchen and bathroom, but carpet in the living room,'' said Michael Wilson, vice president of marketing for Extended Stay America, whose rooms average from $189 to $269 a week, or $27 to $38 a day. ``But the rooms are more than adequate for most of our guests, who include many construction engineers, white-and blue-collar workers and people who are moving.''<ep>
   Many guests seem happy with just the basics, including Bob Carroll, a retired electrical engineer from Gaffney, S.C. Now a consultant to rural electric cooperatives, he had been renting a house for three months while in Columbia before moving into the Extended Stay America.<ep>
   ``This gives me all the space I need,'' he said, ``and the price is so reasonable I don't have to check out when I go home on weekends. I just leave my clothes and computer in my room.''<ql>
