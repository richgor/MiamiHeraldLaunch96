   The nation's unemployment rate dipped to a 14-month low of 5.4 percent last month, giving President Clinton fresh election-year evidence of an improving economy. Republicans focused on big jobs losses in construction and manufacturing.<P>

   After racing ahead with increases of 178,000 in March and a 12-year high of 631,000 in February, nonfarm payrolls expanded by just 2,000 in April.<P>

   The White House noted that April marked the 20th straight month unemployment has been below 6 percent, but Republicans stressed the job losses and the big slowdown in payroll jobs.<P>

   Republicans argued that the unemployment report showed the economy is still struggling, especially in manufacturing, where April's loss of 17,000 jobs brought the total decline in factory workers to 319,000 over the past year.<P>

  The 5.4 percent unemployment rate for April was an improvement from 5.6 percent in March and was the lowest jobless rate since February of 1995.<P>

  In a second report Friday, the Commerce Department said that Americans enjoyed a brisk increase of 0.5 percent in their incomes in March but boosted spending at an even faster pace of 0.6 percent.<P>

   It was the big surge in consumer spending that propelled overall economic growth as measured by the gross domestic product to an advance of 2.8 percent in the first three months of the year.<P>

<H2>April car sales up 8%</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

   April's domestic car and truck sales were up a healthy 8 percent over a year ago, with Ford Motor Co. the only Big Three automaker to show a decrease, according to figures released Friday.<P>

   Ford, the last of the domestic automakers to report its April figures, said its sales fell 2 percent compared with the April 1995 rate, led by a 5.5 percent drop in car sales.<P>

  Pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles continued to drive the market in April. Sales of light trucks by all automakers were up nearly 10 percent, compared with the 6.7 percent rate for cars.<P>

   Chrysler Corp. led the way, reporting earlier this week that its light truck sales were up 40 percent over a year ago, when its sales were slowed by the changeover to its redesigned minivans.<P>

   The Big Three saw the biggest improvement in April sales, up 9 percent. Sales by Asian automakers increased 5.6 percent, while European automakers' sales were virtually unchanged.<P>

   Year to date, domestic and import vehicle sales are up 4 percent over the same period of 1995, with light truck sales up 7.7 percent and cars up 1.5 percent.<P>

THE STOCK MARKET
<!-- start headlines -->
<H2>Stocks end week with a loss</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

   Technology and speculative stocks rallied back Friday from Thursday's steep retreat. But a broader rebound in stocks quickly wilted as the bond market failed to hold on to early gains despite an employment report that calmed some inflation fears.<P>

   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 20.24 points to close at 5,478.03 after clinging to a modest gain most of the session. For the week, the gauge of blue-chip performance was down 89.96 points.<P>

   Bonds rallied early on the smaller-than-expected increase in jobs, lifting the stock market. But the market's underlying worries about inflation became obvious again by late Friday morning as Treasury bond prices started trailing lower. Long-term interest rates, which on Thursday closed above 7 percent for the first time in almost a year, rose even higher, undercutting the rebound in stocks.<P>

  The Nasdaq market -- one of Thursday's biggest losers as investors locked in profits on the recent rally in technology and smaller-company shares -- rose 6.27 to 1,184.60, trimming its loss for the week to 2.29. But blue-chip indicators followed the Dow lower. The New York Stock Exchange's composite index fell 0.81 to 345.40, down 5.42 on the week, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.75 to 641.63, down 11.83 on the week.<P>
