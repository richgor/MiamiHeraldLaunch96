  On the fourth anniversary of Take Our Daughters to Work Day Thursday there was a lot less talk about discrimination against girls and a lot more about the evils of excluding boys.<P>

   The Ms. Foundation for Women, which started the event in 1993, estimates that about 30 percent of participating employers marked the day this year by inviting both sexes to Take Our Children To Work, Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work or even, adding insult to injury, Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work.<P>

   The foundation started Take Our Daughters to Work Day after a wave of highly publicized research about how girls are shortchanged in school and lose self-confidence as they approach adolescence. The response was so overwhelming that what was planned as a program in New York City became a nationwide event involving a million girls at thousands of workplaces.<P>

   ``What created this day,'' said Marie Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation, ``is women, men, teachers, parents, everybody, saying `Right. This is true. I see what happened to my 11-year-old girl, how she used to be sure of herself and now she's not. She used to be interested in math and science, and now she just talks about her hair.' ''<P>

   But as the program grew -- some five million girls took part last year -- so did the controversy about sending girls off to exciting work programs, while their brothers were left in half-empty classrooms.<P>

   Meanwhile, the spirit of the times changed, as programs favoring one sex or race came under sharp attack from opponents of affirmative action. So it should be no surprise that this year, many companies are inviting boys and girls alike to visit.<P>

   Barnett Bank of South Florida, for example, converted to Bring a Child to Work Day, responding to requests from employees.<P>

   ``We extended it to sons, nephews, grandchildren, Big Brothers and Big Sisters,'' said Sandra Gonzalez-Levy, public relations director for the bank. ``We felt it was appropriate.''<P>

   Barnett's 1,200 bank employees in Dade County brought in about 160 kids Thursday, Gonzalez-Levy said. ``A lot of them came dressed up, especially the boys came with ties.''<P>

   At the Chevron Corp., in San Francisco, there was no program for girls this year. Last year, the company participated in the daughters' day in April, taking girls to refineries, glass-blowing demonstrations and discussion groups. Last August, it had a separate program for boys. But from now on, the company plans to alternate, starting this year with a boys' event on June 27.<P>

   Dr. Henry Fraind, assistant superintendent of Miami schools, said that while he understood that the program was designed to help girls and respected that goal, he was leaving it to the individual principals to decide whether to excuse boys from school for the day as well.<P>

   Billie Gimenev, principal of Claude Pepper Elementary School in Miami, said: ``I don't see it as a rigid program. If someone wanted to bring a son to work, they could.''<P>

   Many companies, including Sears, Chrysler and Ameritech, invite boys and girls together.<P>

   ``We want to be inclusive, consistent with everything else we do,'' said Jon Harmon, a spokesman for the Ford Motor Co. in Detroit, where sons and daughters are both welcome. ``We think boys and girls can benefit from seeing men and women working together as equals in the business world. We don't exclude by gender for other things, so why would we for this?''<P>

   That kind of statement, from a company where there is only one woman among the 34 vice presidents -- not an unusual situation -- drives officials of the Ms. Foundation crazy.<P>

   ``Executives with glass ceilings shouldn't throw stones,'' said Jill Savitt, a spokeswoman for Ms. Foundation. ``People are afraid to stand up for girls, or they think some affirmative-action bogeyman's going to get them.''<P>

   Some companies have remained true to the event as originally intended. At the American Express Service Center with close to 4,000 employees employees in Fort Lauderdale, about 225 girls showed up their parents. Boys were not invited, said Elaine Franck, the company's director of communications. <P>

   ``The day was established for very specific reasons,'' she said. ``To support girls who are confronted with things like low confidence and poor self-image during adolescence.''<P>

``It's very important for all children to see where their parents work,'' Franck said. ``But this is just for girls.''<P>
