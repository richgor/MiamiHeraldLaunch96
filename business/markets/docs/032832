<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) In summer of 1994, Intuit Inc.'s chief financial officer, William H. Lane III, shared some exciting news with his wife: The company was going to be bought out by Microsoft Corp. At the time, the $2 billion deal would have been the software industry's biggest merger.<ep>
   The problem was, Kathleen Lane shared the secret with her son and daughter. The children, together with three others, used the merger news to buy Intuit stock and options ahead of the Microsoft announcement. And then they bailed out a year later when Mrs. Lane warned them of the merger's imminent collapse, federal regulators said Thursday.<ep>
   Thus evolved one of the more unusual insider trading cases, in which a <m2><ql>

INTUIT,  FROM  1C<ql>
<m0>top executive's wife, a school teacher and four graphic artists paid $472,343 to settle federal securities fraud charges.<ep>
   The Californians named in the Securities and Exchange Commission case were Mrs. Lane, 53, of Los Altos; her children, James Propp, 33, and Julie Propp, 35, both of San Francisco; and three friends, Robert Guerin, 37; and Luther Knox, 35, both of San Francisco; and Paul Tsang, 37 of San Leandro. As part of the settlement, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, all six neither admitted nor denied charges in the SEC's 12-page complaint.<ep>
   William Lane and the Menlo Park, Calif.-based Intuit were not charged in the SEC's case.<ep>
   Asked why the Intuit executive wasn't charged, SEC attorney Daniel Nathan responded: ``He confided information to his wife and there's nothing wrong with that under securities laws, if it's not with any intention . . . to use the information to improperly trade securities.''<ep>
   The SEC's case said William Lane didn't know that his wife had leaked word of the merger, or that she loaned money to her daughter and a friend for purchase of Intuit shares.<ep>
   The case dates back to Aug. 3, 1994, when Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest maker of software for personal computers, and Intuit Inc., maker of the popular Quicken financial software program, began secret merger talks. William Lane, who was part of the discussions, confided in his wife, expecting she would keep the secret.<ep>
   According to the SEC, Mrs. Lane tipped off her son that Intuit faced a major takeover. He passed on the tip to two business partners, Tsang and Guerin, and suggested they buy Intuit stock through their graphic design company, which has since disbanded. <m1>  <m0>Mrs. Lane also told her daughter, a school teacher, of a major announcement at Intuit and that Mrs. Lane ``and her husband would be retiring early,'' the SEC said. Julie Propp shared this with a friend, Luther Knox. Later, Mrs. Lane wrote checks worth $56,000 so Knox and Julie Propp could buy Intuit stock before the Microsoft announcement, the SEC said.<ep>
   Intuit's stock soared $17.12 1/2 to $67.37 1/2 a share the day after the Oct. 13, 1994, announcement.<ep>
   The Microsoft-Intuit merger began to unravel on April 27, 1995, when the Justice Department sued to block the deal, arguing it would have reduced competition in the market for personal financial software. Mrs. Lane was charged with tipping her son and Tsang to the impending adverse news before Microsoft abandoned its takeover plans, which occurred on Saturday, May 20, 1995. James Propp, Tsang and Guerin in turn sold Intuit stock and purchased put options, which produce a profit on the stock's resulting fall.<ep>
