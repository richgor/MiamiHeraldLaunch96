   WASHINGTON -- (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew at a moderate pace in March and April, with stronger activity in retail sales, real estate and even manufacturing, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in its latest survey of regional economic conditions.<P>

   The Fed report found little sign of inflationary pressures, discounting recent spurts in gasoline and food prices as temporary.<P>

   That benign view on inflation was credited with helping to spark a big rally in financial markets on Wednesday as investors grew less worried that the central bank would raise interest rates at its next meeting on May 21.<P>

   ``The new report is confirmation that the Fed doesn't feel we are in a runaway growth period,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``They made it very clear that they are not concerned with inflation yet and what we have seen are isolated price increases they can live with.''<P>

Markets rally<BR>
<P>

   Financial markets, which have been battered in recent weeks because of inflation fears, rallied strongly in a wild trading day.<P>

   The Dow Jones industrial average, which at one time was down more than 78 points, staged an afternoon rally and closed up 53.11 points at 5,474.06.<P>

   Some of the big turnarounds among the Dow industrials included Merck, up $1.62 to $59.37; J.P. Morgan, up $1.62 to $84.37; Chevron, up $1.50 to $56.62; and Eastman Kodak, up $2 at $75.62.<P>

   The NYSE's composite index rose 2.65 to 345.98 after falling as much as 4 points earlier in the session. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.52 to 644.78, rebounding from a loss of more than 8 points.<P>

   The Nasdaq composite index, down almost 20 at one point, rose 0.76 to 1,183.43.<P>

  Bonds also had a good day with strong demand for Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond pushing the yield below 7 percent for the first time in a week.<P>

   ``Economic activity advanced at a moderate pace in March and April,'' the Fed said in its summary of reports from its 12 regional banks.<P>

   The survey showed all districts except New York reported a pickup in economic activity during the past two months with most reporting strength in retail sales and manufacturing, where an overhang of unsold inventories has been depressing production for much of the past year.<P>

Subdued price pressures<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   While the prices of gasoline and some food products have been surging in recent weeks, the central bank took the view that the spurt was likely to be temporary and not lead to an overall inflation spiral.<P>

   ``Price pressures remained generally subdued and there were only scattered reports of wage pressures despite continued tight labor markets and somewhat stronger economic growth,'' the central bank said. ``Most districts reported little upward pressure on prices other than sharply higher prices for grains and energy-related items,'' the Fed said.<P>

   The Fed survey, known as the Beige Book, is prepared eight times a year in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, the panel of Fed governors and regional bank presidents that meets eight times a year to set interest rate policies.<P>

   After the government reported last week a surprisingly rapid rebound in the overall economy, some forecasters began to worry that the Fed might begin raising rates at the May 21 meeting. But officials said the new Fed economic outlook should put those fears to rest.<P>

   Many economists predicted the central bank could well leave policy unchanged until after the November election.<P>

   The Fed reduced short-term interest rates three separate times in July, December and January in an effort to keep last year's sluggish growth from worsening into a recession.<P>

   While earlier this year, economists were predicting more rate reductions were ahead, various signs of an improving economy have convinced many of them that rate reductions are over and the Fed's next move late this year or early next year will be rate increases.
