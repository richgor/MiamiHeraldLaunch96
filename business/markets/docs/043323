<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) The U.S. economy cruised forward at a 2.8 percent growth rate in the first three months of this year, the Commerce Department reported Thursday, startling Wall Street.<ep>
   The gain, following anemic 0.5 percent growth in the last three months of 1995, came in the wake of government shutdowns, a major blizzard and the General Motors strike. It reflected unexpectedly brisk spending by consumers and business, much of it on computers.<ep>
   The news that the gross domestic product (--) a measure of all the goods and services produced in the national economy (--) had grown more than expected came as welcome news to the White House as President Clinton maps his re-election strategy.<ep>
   But at the same time, the news frightened many investors, and stock and bond prices plunged. The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 77 points, broader markets also tumbled, and the interest rate on a 30-year Treasury bond edged over 7 percent for the first time in nearly a year.<ep>
   ``The market is fearful that (Federal Reserve Chairman) Alan Greenspan is going to hike interest rates,'' explained Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.<ep>
   While a 2.8 percent growth rate would normally be viewed as moderate, <m2><ql>

ECONOMY,  FROM  1C<ql>
<m0>analysts said that the number understated the economy's actual strength, given the peculiar burdens the economy was working against earlier this year. Without the GM strike, for instance, growth would have reached a more ebullient 4 percent rate, the government reported.<ep>
   ``This is the best of all worlds (--) solid growth with low inflation,'' declared Edward E. Yardeni, chief economist with the Deutsche Morgan Grenfell investment firm in New York. ``You've got to be awfully impressed with the performance of the economy, given that we threw a blizzard at it and had the government shutdowns.''<ep>
   Yet Thursday's report offered little evidence of an inflation problem. One price measure, known as the GDP Price Index, rose at just a 2.5 percent annual rate.<ep>
   The growth report is just the latest in a recent series of statistics that suggest the national economy is heartier than many had thought. The Commerce Department also reported Thursday that U.S. factory orders rose 1.5 percent in March, the first gain of the year. Separately, claims for jobless benefits slipped last week to the lowest level in more than three months, hinting of strength in the labor market. <m1> <m0>And earlier his week, the Conference Board said that consumer confidence had surged dramatically in April.<ep>
