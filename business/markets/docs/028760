<m0>   NEW YORK (--) Asked Wednesday which way stock and bond prices were going, Wall Street traders responded like the confused posse in a slapstick Western, shouting ``Thataway!,'' and pointing in every direction at once.<ep>
   Thus began a day of unprecedented volatility on the New York Stock Exchange. Less than an hour after the start of trading, sharply falling stock prices triggered the Big Board's 50-point ``collar,'' which attempts to quell volatility by restricting certain types of computer-driven trading.<ep>
   Then, late in the day's session, the collar was triggered again by rising prices, as the Dow raced more than 50 points above Tuesday's close.<ep>
   It was the first time that the collars had been used in both directions on the same day since the so-called circuit-breakers were put into effect in the wake of the market crash of 1987.<ep>
   The sharp turns in stock prices followed a similar move in the bond market, where prices headed higher early Wednesday afternoon. Analysts cited a stronger-than-expected auction of 10-year U.S. government notes in the bond market's reversal. Some also mentioned the Federal Reserve Board's release of its ``beige book'' survey of the economy, which said the economy's continued strong growth last month brought with it only moderate signs of rising inflation.<ep>
   At the end of it all, the yield on the 30-year government bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell below 7 percent for the first time in four days, finishing at 6.96 percent.<ep>
   The Dow industrials, meanwhile, which were down more than 78 points at one juncture, ended the day with a gain of 53.11 points, at 5474.06.<ep>
   But if professional traders are uncertain about the markets' direction, individual investors appear steadfast, at least when it comes to stocks.<ep>

MARKETS,  FROM  1C<ql>
<m0>According to estimates released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, cash flow into equity mutual funds in April totaled $23 billion, up slightly from March and the second-highest total ever.<ep>
   Bond funds, meanwhile, recorded no net gain or loss in assets last month, the trade group estimated.<ep>
   Those cash flows, of course, reflect in part money committed to mutual funds before the April 15 tax deadline, and some companies that track mutual fund cash flows have reported that inflows slowed late last month and in early May. In the meantime, market gurus at some of Wall Street's biggest investment banks have grown increasingly cautious.<ep>
   For example, Byron Wien, a closely watched investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, recently penned a report titled ``The Coming 1,000 Point Decline,'' a prophecy that, if true, would result in a fall of nearly 20 percent in the Dow industrials.<ep>
   And Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's global strategist, startled Wall Street on Monday with his recommendation that investors take a smidgen of their international holdings and invest in gold, the traditional haven of inflation-hedging pessimists.<ep>
   Some market observers saw in Wednesday's trading activity a clear rejection of that bearishness, which appeared to be gaining speed after four straight declines in the Dow industrials.<ep>
   Ralph Acampora, a technical analyst at Prudential Securities, said that traders were closely watching the Dow as it moved below 5,400 Wednesday. The bellwether index last closed below that level on Feb. 2.<ep>
   As a technical analyst, Acampora tries to forecast the stock market's direction based on past levels of prices, volume and other market indicators. When the bond market started to move higher, he said, buyers quickly appeared for stocks that had been beaten down in recent sessions.<ep>
   ``That tempered the bearishness that has been building up for several days,'' Acampora said. ``I think this will serve as the bottom for more sustained advance in stock prices later on.''<ep>
