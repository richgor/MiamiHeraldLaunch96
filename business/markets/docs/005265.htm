 Steve Halpern regularly reviews more than 400 stock newsletters, choosing what he believes to be the most interesting or informed recommendations for inclusion in this column and his own newsletter, the Dick Davis Digest.<BR>
<P>

  Pharmaceutical companies are favorites among some of the advisers we follow. Here are a few of their latest recommendations.<BR>
Warner-Lambert<BR>
NYSE (Symbol: WLA)<BR>
52-week range: 77 7/8-115 1/2<BR>
Friday's close: 109 1/2<BR>
<P>

  ``Warner-Lambert has rallied to all-time highs, benefiting from takeover speculation and optimism regarding new drugs. Atorvastatin, a cholesterol reducer, and troglitazone, a diabetes treatment, could begin contributing to earnings in 1997. The firm has argued for years that its investment in drug research would pay dividends and that the firm should remain independent. Ironically, new products could allow it to merge on terms that are acceptable to management. The stock should be held.''<BR>
Richard Moroney,<BR>
Dow Theory Forecasts<BR>
Hammond, Ind.<BR>
<BR>
Merck<BR>
NYSE (Symbol: MRK)<BR>
52-week range: 41 1/4-71 3/8<BR>
Friday's close: 58 1/4<BR>
<P>

  ``One of the worst performing components in the Dow in the first quarter was Merck. The decline came largely due to concern over gastrointestinal side effects from Fosamax, Merck's new drug for osteoporosis. Despite the side effects, Fosamax should generate U.S. sales of $175 million in 1996. Further, earnings for 1996 are estimated at $3.15, up from $2.70; 1997's earnings are estimated at $3.65. Its $1.36 dividend returns a current yield of 2.2 percent. We recommend Merck and expect it to return to the low 70s in the next three months, with the chance of it reaching more than 90 over the next year.''<BR>
William LeFevre,<BR>
Monday Morning Market Memo<BR>
New York<BR>
<BR>
Amgen<BR>
Nasdaq (Symbol: AMGN)<BR>
52-week range: 34 13/16-66 1/2<BR>
Friday's close: 52 3/8<BR>
<P>

  ``Amgen is one of the kings of the biotech sector. It earns $1.8 billion with just two drugs. The first, epogen, enhances the lives of more than 320,000 kidney dialysis patients. The second, neupogen, enhances the lives of chemotherapy patients. The company is focusing its attention on additional blood-related drugs. MGDF is in clinical phase one and two. It improves production of blood platelets. Leptin, an anti-obesity drug, is now in the animal testing stage. It is hoped the drug will control the urge to eat. Parkinson's disease is the focus of another drug in testing. For the patient investor who is willing to ignore interim volatility, this company should see spectacular long-term growth.''<BR>
Peter Green,<BR>
Green on Money<BR>
Cinnaminson, N.J.<BR>
<BR>
Boston Scientific<BR>
Nasdaq (Symbol: BSX)<BR>
52-week range: 25 1/2-51 5/8<BR>
Friday's close: 42 3/8<BR>
<P>

  ``Boston Scientific recently held its annual analyst meeting; in a nutshell, it was a very upbeat meeting that shed a great deal of light on both the nature of and growth potential for all of the company's various businesses. We left the meeting feeling very comfortable about our outlook for the company over the course of 1996, which calls for a 24.1 percent increase in sales and a 31 percent increase in earnings per share to $1.60.''<BR>
Arch Smith,<BR>
Piper Jaffray<BR>
<BR>
Somatogen<BR>
Nasdaq (Symbol: SMTG)<BR>
52-week range: 9 1/4-26 1/8<BR>
Friday's close: 17 3/8<BR>
<P>

  ``Somatogen has been buffeted by negative comments on CNBC, quoting one of the short-sellers. It was not the first time we have heard comments of this sort, but the stock dropped nonetheless. We cannot control these irrationalities, but we can take advantage of the bargains they provide. Somatogen announced the addition of Bernadine Healy, immediate past director of the National Institutes of Health, to its board of directors. SMTG is a buy under 25.''<BR>
Jim McCamant,<BR>
The Medical Technology Stock Letter<BR>
Berkeley, Calif.<BR>
<BR>
IVAX<BR>
ASE (Symbol: IVX)<BR>
52-week range: 22-32 1/4<BR>
Friday's close: 29 1/4<BR>
<P>

  ``IVAX has a bright outlook, given its strong lineup of new generic products coupled with contributions from promising new proprietary drugs. We expect profits to climb 35 percent this year to $1.30 per share, following 1995's 25 percent advance. The company led the generic drug industry last year in regulatory approvals, with 18 new approvals from the FDA. IVAX currently has 20 generic filings pending. We rate the stock a buy for capital gains.''<BR>
