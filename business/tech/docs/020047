<m0>   Just like housework, no operating system is ever really finished. There's always something you can add, improve, clean up, protect, customize or automate.<ep>
   That's what ``utility'' programs are for. These don't tackle the big tasks (--) processing words or calculating numbers or drawing images (--) that so-called application programs handle. Utilities don't get the same respect as the applications, but they make your system work a lot better.<ep>
   Operating systems, in fact, are really a software foundation (--) to start the computer (--) surrounded by a bunch of utilities that keep it running smoothly. Some of these utilities are so closely integrated that you can't figure out where the foundation ends and the utilities start. Some utilities are so independent that it's clear the operating system maker just tossed them in to sweeten the pot.<ep>
   DOS and Windows 3.1 offer a bunch of independent utilities, for such jobs as disk compression (to give you more room on your disks), virus protection and backup automation. Windows 95 has utilities too, but a different bunch. Memory management is built in, so it's not as important as in Windows 3.1 and DOS. Disk compression and backup automation come with Windows 95 too, as they did with Windows 3.1.<ep>
   But all three of those built-in utilities can be improved upon by adding better independent tools. And Windows 95 leaves out some utilities that were free with DOS and Windows 3.1, such as virus protection.<ep>
   So what's worth adding to Windows 95? What is critical and what is just nice? Safety comes first for me, ahead of performance: brakes before turbo-charging.<ql>
<m0>Safety<ql>
<m1>   <m0>(box) Virus protection tops my list. You need it and Windows 95 doesn't have any. My favorite is VirusScan for Windows 95 (McAfee, 800-332-9966, $40). It's inexpensive, thorough, updatable (important with all the new viruses appearing), and doesn't take up much disk space. Norton Anti-Virus for Windows 95 (Symantec, 800-441-7234, $80) gets uniformly top-notch ratings in trade magazine reviews. Both get traditional viruses and those new, scary ``Word macro'' viruses. Other major anti-virus products include Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit for Windows 95 (S&S International, 800-701-9648, $90), F-Prot Professional (Command Software Systems, 800-423-9147, $170) and AntiVirus 2.4 (IBM, 800-426-2255, $50).<ep>
   (box) Backup comes next on my hit parade because I just hate it when an important file turns up missing, typically when I'm on deadline. There's a little, inadequate backup utility in Windows 95. To get serious about backup, don't look for software first, instead look for a good backup hardware device, such as an Iomega Zip drive, tape drive or optical disc, and see what backup utility comes free with it. You can't practically back up to floppy disks, so you'll need one of these devices. Only then should you consider moving beyond to other backup software, and then you'll have to ensure that the software you choose is compatible with your particular backup device.<ep>
    (box) Archivers are the ticket for software you don't use often but may want to get at occasionally. They store those files, and keep a catalog of them so you know what's in them and where to find them later. Many backup utilities have some archiving commands, but more serious archiving is in Norton Navigator for Windows 95 (Symantec, 800-441-7234, $100) or the shareware program WinZip 6.0 for Windows 95 (available online).<ep>
   (box) File-transfer utilities aren't vital for everyone, but I sure get a lot of use from them. In fact, instead of backing up to a tape or optical disc, I often just synchronize (copy back and forth until all files are the same) the files on my laptop and desktop PCs. There's some rudimentary file transfer built into Windows 95, but I prefer LapLink for Windows 95 (Traveling Software, 800-343-8080, $130) because it's so flexible. Anywhere32 (Symantec, 800-441-7234, $150) is good but less flexible.<ql>
<m0>Disk management<ep>
<m0>   (box) The more programs and drivers and files and documents I pile onto my computer, the sooner it will slow down, act finicky or even crash. Uninstallers are the first step in keeping your disk ``clean.'' From programs you only use once, such as tax software, to programs you're having trouble with (--) the new game that's crashing your other programs (--) it's nice to be able to throw the bums out, avoiding conflicts and saving disk space. If you only install a few programs and then use them regularly, Windows 95's uninstaller utility will probably be enough. But it only works with 32-bit Windows 95 programs. To get all that other debris, I prefer CleanSweep 95 (Quarterdeck, 800-683-6696, $30) followed closely by Remove-It 3.0 (Vertisoft, 800-466-5875, $35) and UnInstaller 3.0 (MicroHelp, 800-777-3322, $40). CleanSweep is the smartest, finding all the things you might not need while protecting you from overzealous deleting (--) so you don't throw out the necessary programming baby (such as software drivers related to both a program you don't want and to another you do want) with the obsolete file bathwater.<ep>
   (box) Disk compressors squeeze files down to take up less space and then, when you need the files, automatically reinflate them for use. I tend to avoid them. But if you have a Pentium (--) compression uses processor power (--) the DriveSpace 2 that comes on the original Windows 95 CD-ROM is just fine. If you really want the maximum compression, to as much as double how much you can fit on your hard drive, consider DriveSpace 3 that is on the Windows 95 Plus! Pak (Microsoft, 800-426-9400, $40). <m1><ql>
<m0>Performance<ep>
<m0>   (box) Windows 95 controls the various pieces of your computer (--) from the screen to disk drives to mouse and so on (--) with little pieces of software called drivers. Many come with Windows 95. But if you can get a newer, faster, perhaps even ``32-bit native'' driver from Microsoft or the company that makes the particular peripheral, it will probably be faster than the generic driver. Check online or call the companies.<ep>
   (box) A diagnostic utility can tell you what shape your PC is in, from its memory and disks to its ports and even some of its peripherals. Windows 95 comes with its own basic diagnostic and tuneup utilities. Nontechies who want more should consider First Aid 95 (CyberMedia, 800-721-7824, $40) (--) though both PC magazine and PC/Computing report some obsolete information and buggy operations inside it. Advanced users, even repair-shop technicians, can look to WinProbe 4 (Quarterdeck, 800-683-6696, $50) or WinCheckIt 4.0 (TouchStone, 800-531-0450, $50).<ep>
   (box) Only 32-bit Windows 95 programs get to use long file names. While 16-bit Windows 3.1 programs run under Windows 95, they don't do long file names unless you add Name-IT (Vertisoft, 800-380-2611, $30) which automatically updates Windows 3.1 programs to use the same long file names.<ql>
<m0>Customizing<ep>
<m0>   Desktop customizers put a new face on Windows and give you new ways to find files, start programs and view what's in files without having the programs that created those programs. I think all of these are candy to intermediate and advanced users, just more confusion and unneeded complexity to beginners.<ep>
   (box) If you're going to customize, start with PowerToys (Microsoft, 800-426-9400, free download at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/powertoy.htm. It lets you change screen resolution and color, print Internet HTML pages and change the way windows open and close. And it adds more options to the Explorer utility for organizing files.<ep>
   (box) Dashboard 95 (Starfish, 800-765-7839, $50) is a powerful Windows 3.1 tool that has less oomph in Windows 95. It adds a customizable graphic toolbar chock full of dials and meters telling you what Windows 95 is doing, plus menus and icons for launching programs in a hurry. Dashboard also lets you schedule events so you can set your PC to follow a timer. A new version called Internet Dashboard will add net browsing connections.<ep>
   (box) Norton Navigator for Windows 95 (Symantec, 800-441-7234, $100) lets you create multiple desktops that you can switch among right on the standard Windows 95 toolbar. You can create entire desktops (--) with their own collection of icons (--) for each project. <m1><ql>
<m0>And more ...<ep>
<m0>   We've only scratched the utility surface. There are font-management utilities, screen saver utilities, printer utilities and Internet utilities (--) topics we'll have to cover another time.<ep>
   The bottom line for this week: Start with more memory, free driver updates, the free PowerToys enhancer, and learning about the utilities that are built into Windows 95. Add virus protection and backup as soon as you can. Then, perhaps, add a general utility package such as the Norton Utilities for Windows 95 (Symantec, 800-441-7234, $120).<ep>
   In general, don't spend too much on utilities for Windows 95 unless you're a constant computer user and want to customize and upgrade every facet of your PC.<ep>
