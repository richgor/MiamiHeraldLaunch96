<m1>W<m0>ith the dizzying swirl of products introduced each week, sometimes it's worthwhile to step back and look at the big picture.<ep>
   Battelle, an Ohio consulting company, recently peered into its crystal ball for a long-range view. It singled out a couple of product trends that it predicts will be technology staples by the year 2006.<ep>
   What is striking about its list is that the top picks aren't far-out ideas that you'd only find at some of the nation's top computer labs. Instead, they are grounded in products you can buy today. Here's a sampling:<ep>
   <m0>(box) Personalized computers. <m0>Within a decade, Battelle says, computers will learn how you work and play. They will save you time by anticipating your needs and doing work before being asked.<ep>
   ``The personalized computer will be as mobile and versatile as its user, sending and receiving wireless data and accessing information from remote sites,'' Battelle's report says.<ep>
   At least one version of this technology is already a reality.<ep>
   Ex Machina, a New York company with an engineering staff in Newport Beach, Calif., recently announced a computer accessory card called AirMedia Live! that can do just that.<ep>
   It uses existing paging frequencies to serve as a wireless link between your computer and multiple sources of information either on commercial online services or the Internet.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Next generation TV. <m0>Someday our television sets will be as large and flat as paintings, Battelle says. These TVs won't be the large projection TVs you see today; they will be high definition models with clarity approaching that of a movie screen.<ep>
   That's not all.<ep>
   TVs of the next decade won't be just TVs. The screens will do double duty as computer monitors and will be capable of interacting with an entire network of PCs.<ep>
   They will be designed for video conferencing, the picture phones of tomorrow, and will make it possible to have a window on a variety of other PC networks from the Internet to the computers at your office.<ep>
   Computer companies also have a head start on this trend as well.<ep>
   Skinny TV exhibits were a big trend at November's Comdex trade show in Las Vegas. Sharp had a whole wall of skinny TVs that looked like the monitor half of a notebook computer. And these screens were smart (--) they could split in half to handle two video streams.<ep>
   Samsung Electronics, which owns a stake in AST Research, also was showing off the screens of tomorrow. It had a 22-inch liquid crystal display that it is now selling to companies.<ep>
   And Mitsubishi debuted its plasma screen technology, which can be built in large sizes because it's not as difficult or expensive to manufacture as the advanced color screens sold today.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Smart maps and tracking devices. <m0>Global positioning systems and ``smart'' maps will be merged into technologies that can show travelers, boaters and hikers their exact positions and then give them directions.<ep>
   Ultimately, Battelle predicts, these devices will be modified for use as anti-collision devices for cars and trucks.<ep>
   Tracking devices already have hit the marketplace in a big way. One software company in Arizona is using Rockwell International's GPS system to help golfers locate their balls on a course.<ep>
   And several car manufacturers are offering a GPS system in luxury automobiles to help drivers find their way.<ep>
   On the map side, Thomas Bros. in Irvine is busy selling electronic versions of its street guides which can be searched with a click or two of the mouse.<ep>
   If the technology gets cheap enough, the local Italian restaurant might start using GPS technology and electronic maps to deliver a hot pizza pie to your house not in 30 minutes, but 15.<ep>
   Battelle lists several other technologies.<ep>
   It predicts that weight control and anti-aging products will be big hits. And that companies will develop smart materials that can detect excessive stress. That way, the materials could alert people when a bridge or office building becomes unsafe.<ep>
   It also is keeping an eye on the potential for ``geneticeuticals,'' which would be used to cure or mitigate various diseases, and home health monitors to enable doctors to track a patient's health.<ep>
   No question, all of these advances are attainable. It's just a matter of time.<ep>
   What gives me pause, after this little venture to 2006, isn't what is possible, but what we still can't do.<ep>
   A personalized computer sounds great, but today I'd settle for one that could consistently handle the basics.<ep>
   Give me a PC that won't force me to know anything about a ``.dll'' file or an interrupt request. And rather than a large TV screen that looks like a painting, how about a decent-sized active matrix on my notebook computer that doesn't cost as much as my car?<ep>
   Now that would be progress.<ql>
