ith the dizzying swirl of products introduced each week, sometimes it's worthwhile to step back and look at the big picture.<P>

   Battelle, an Ohio consulting company, recently peered into its crystal ball for a long-range view. It singled out a couple of product trends that it predicts will be technology staples by the year 2006.<P>

   What is striking about its list is that the top picks aren't far-out ideas that you'd only find at some of the nation's top computer labs. Instead, they are grounded in products you can buy today. Here's a sampling:<P>

   <LI> Personalized computers. Within a decade, Battelle says, computers will learn how you work and play. They will save you time by anticipating your needs and doing work before being asked.<P>

   ``The personalized computer will be as mobile and versatile as its user, sending and receiving wireless data and accessing information from remote sites,'' Battelle's report says.<P>

   At least one version of this technology is already a reality.<P>

   Ex Machina, a New York company with an engineering staff in Newport Beach, Calif., recently announced a computer accessory card called AirMedia Live! that can do just that.<P>

   It uses existing paging frequencies to serve as a wireless link between your computer and multiple sources of information either on commercial online services or the Internet.<P>

   <LI> Next generation TV. Someday our television sets will be as large and flat as paintings, Battelle says. These TVs won't be the large projection TVs you see today; they will be high definition models with clarity approaching that of a movie screen.<P>

   That's not all.<P>

   TVs of the next decade won't be just TVs. The screens will do double duty as computer monitors and will be capable of interacting with an entire network of PCs.<P>

   They will be designed for video conferencing, the picture phones of tomorrow, and will make it possible to have a window on a variety of other PC networks from the Internet to the computers at your office.<P>

   Computer companies also have a head start on this trend as well.<P>

   Skinny TV exhibits were a big trend at November's Comdex trade show in Las Vegas. Sharp had a whole wall of skinny TVs that looked like the monitor half of a notebook computer. And these screens were smart -- they could split in half to handle two video streams.<P>

   Samsung Electronics, which owns a stake in AST Research, also was showing off the screens of tomorrow. It had a 22-inch liquid crystal display that it is now selling to companies.<P>

   And Mitsubishi debuted its plasma screen technology, which can be built in large sizes because it's not as difficult or expensive to manufacture as the advanced color screens sold today.<P>

   <LI> Smart maps and tracking devices. Global positioning systems and ``smart'' maps will be merged into technologies that can show travelers, boaters and hikers their exact positions and then give them directions.<P>

   Ultimately, Battelle predicts, these devices will be modified for use as anti-collision devices for cars and trucks.<P>

   Tracking devices already have hit the marketplace in a big way. One software company in Arizona is using Rockwell International's GPS system to help golfers locate their balls on a course.<P>

   And several car manufacturers are offering a GPS system in luxury automobiles to help drivers find their way.<P>

   On the map side, Thomas Bros. in Irvine is busy selling electronic versions of its street guides which can be searched with a click or two of the mouse.<P>

   If the technology gets cheap enough, the local Italian restaurant might start using GPS technology and electronic maps to deliver a hot pizza pie to your house not in 30 minutes, but 15.<P>

   Battelle lists several other technologies.<P>

   It predicts that weight control and anti-aging products will be big hits. And that companies will develop smart materials that can detect excessive stress. That way, the materials could alert people when a bridge or office building becomes unsafe.<P>

   It also is keeping an eye on the potential for ``geneticeuticals,'' which would be used to cure or mitigate various diseases, and home health monitors to enable doctors to track a patient's health.<P>

   No question, all of these advances are attainable. It's just a matter of time.<P>

   What gives me pause, after this little venture to 2006, isn't what is possible, but what we still can't do.<P>

   A personalized computer sounds great, but today I'd settle for one that could consistently handle the basics.<P>

   Give me a PC that won't force me to know anything about a ``.dll'' file or an interrupt request. And rather than a large TV screen that looks like a painting, how about a decent-sized active matrix on my notebook computer that doesn't cost as much as my car?<P>

   Now that would be progress.
