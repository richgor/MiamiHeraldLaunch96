  Affluent blacks, NationsBank wants you.<P>

   In the latest segment-marketing wrinkle, the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank is targeting black entrepreneurs and corporate executives with household incomes between $50,000 and $100,000, as well as black-owned businesses, for loans and other services.<P>

   It's a strategy aimed at gaining credit-worthy customers in the bank's nine-state area, while boosting its image in black communities. The plan also may help the bank gain favor with federal regulators the next time it wants to acquire another bank.<P>

   NationsBank's new Professional African-American Market Development unit plans to attract clients through marketing agreements with black professional associations, said Shedrick Barber, senior vice president and national coordinator of the unit.<P>

   The bank already has signed up Meharry Medical College in Nashville and Washington-based Progressive National Baptist Convention, with 2.5 million members. Through deals the bank makes with an organization, members can get special rates on loans and other services, Barber said.<P>

   NationsBank will announce its plans at the inaugural Black Enterprise Magazine Entrepreneurs Conference May 1-5 in Orlando.<P>

   With one million households, the affluent black market has been underserved by major banks, Barber said. Yet the market's attractiveness is hard to beat.<P>

   Nationwide, black purchasing power -- personal income after taxes -- reached $427.3 billion in 1996, a 41 percent increase since 1990, said Jeffrey M. Humphreys, director of economic forecasting at the University of Georgia. During the same period, total purchasing power increased 35 percent.<P>

   Florida is the eighth fastest-growing state in terms of black purchasing power -- hitting $22.9 million in 1996, up 51 percent since 1990, he said.<P>

   ``What the numbers show is the economic power of black consumers,'' Humphreys said. ``Not just the fact that this is a lot of cash, but this segment of the market is growing faster than the market as a whole.''<P>

   However, Ken Thomas, a Miami banking analyst and minority lending expert, said the downside of NationsBank's marketing strategy is that the bank risks alienating its other black customers. Thomas gives NationsBank good marks in meeting Community Redevelopment Act and fair lending criteria nationwide.<P>

   But Barber said the bank will not ignore its less affluent black customers.<P>

   ``We've already had aggressive marketing and product development in the low-to-moderate income census tract community,'' he said. ``And that will remain an ongoing focus of NationsBank.''<BR>
