   The Best Funds to Buy Now <m0>(unless you have a better idea)<m0><ep>
   81 Stock Funds That Will Double Your Money <m0>(just so long as you hang on long enough)<m0><ep>
<m0>   This isn't some interminable list of the 3,700 stock funds available. Instead, with the assistance of Chicago fund researchers Morningstar Inc., we took that list and slashed it down to 81 stock funds that might be worth buying.<ep>
   The idea was to put together a list of well-diversified funds that would be useful to folks who invest on their own, without the help of a broker. How did we do that? First, we eliminated all specialty funds, which may appeal to traders, but don't have much role in a long-term portfolio. We also threw out all funds with investment minimums above $5,000. <m1>  <m0>We eliminated funds that charge a sales commission, including low-load funds such as Fidelity Magellan Fund, and those with annual expenses above 1.5 percent. Finally, we ditched any fund that hadn't beaten the average for its category over the past five years, and we made sure that the manager responsible for the record was still around.<ep>
   A sophisticated selection process? Hardly. But with thousands of stock funds to choose from, you have to find some way of narrowing the choice.<ep>
  The 81 funds in the chart aren't some dazzling collection of hot prospects, and they don't come with any seal of approval. Moreover, there are lots of funds worth buying that aren't among the 81 funds. But the list does provide a good starting point for further research. Putting together a portfolio? Consider picking one or two funds from each of the four categories in the accompanying chart. Don't forget to ask for a company prospectus before investing.<ep>
