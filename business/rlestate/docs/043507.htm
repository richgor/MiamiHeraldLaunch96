  As South Miami's pink elephant, the Bakery Centre, begins crumbling in demolition, its owners are pursuing a dream team of potential tenants for its new life as an open-air shopping and entertainment complex.<P>

   A number of proposed tenants -- Niketown, Barnes & Noble, Wolfgang Puck, Disney Store, Warner Bros. Studio Store, Rainforest Cafe and Virgin Records -- figure in the developers' plan to transform the complex into the thriving spot it never was.<P>

   Considering the name behind the project, the Simon Property Group, the goal could be within reach, said retail observers and local project developers. They said Mel Simon, the company's founder and leader, wields the clout, reputation and know-how that turns non-deals into leases, hard-to-get stores into tenants.<P>

   ``The project will happen because Simon is doing it,'' said Arthur Weiner, a lease broker and retail consultant in Aventura. ``It's that simple.''<P>

   The Simon company itself is more cautious.<P>

   ``There have been leases signed,'' said Tom Schneider, vice president of development. He wouldn't disclose signed tenants nor the names of those proposed. ``We're out there marketing this project very heavily,'' he said.<P>

   Next week at a deal-making industry convention in Las Vegas, the Simon Group will circulate a package describing ``The Shops at Sunset Place,'' the name of the rebuilt Bakery Centre at Sunset Drive and Red Road: an open-air, three-story, multi-terraced complex, with stores, restaurants, theaters and apartments that the developers liken to Mizner Park in Boca Raton.<P>

   It will have 550,000 square feet of retail space -- more than three times the size of Cocowalk in Coconut Grove. Rents, which in the old Bakery Centre were about $18 a square foot, will start at $25 and go as high as $50.<P>

   But the key tenants in the leasing plan now circulating among lease brokers and retailers include players who claim their own retail pedigree. They rank as highly desirable tenants, who are considering other sites for South Florida stores, such as Mayfair in Coconut Grove, the Aventura Mall expansion, The Falls in Kendall and South Beach.<P>

   ``We don't want to buy us a space. We want the landlord to want us as much as we want them,'' said Steve Schussler, executive vice president of Rainforest Cafe, a 2-year-old restaurant-and-stores company in Hopkins, Minn., designed around rain forest theatricals.<P>

   Rainforest Cafe, which opened a restaurant in Disney World in Orlando and in Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, is deciding between Aventura Mall or Bakery Centre, Schussler said. Among negotiating points are a prominent spot and a high tenant allowance -- money the developer allocates for building the store or restaurant.<P>

   A high allowance also is a requirement for Wolfgang Puck, the restaurant company named after the California celebrity chef.<P>

   ``Usually landlords come to us with that,'' said Wolfgang Puck President Selwyn Joffe, who said the company is considering Bakery Centre, Coconut Grove, South Beach, Aventura and The Falls for its first South Florida restaurant. ``We're very selective of where we go; we're very picky with the space. But we're a good deal for the landlord. We do some of the top numbers in the industry.''<P>

   The hottest store name in the leasing plan is Niketown, a concept launched by the athletic shoe maker in 1990. The store would make a big splash because there are only four now open across the country, and Nike spares nothing on special effects and crowd-pleasing props.<P>

   The Niketown in Portland, Ore., for example, has a town square with life-size statues of superstar athletes like Michael Jordan and Andre Agassi. The Chicago store has a 900-gallon salt-water fish tank and an in-store basketball court.<P>

   ``It would be a huge coup,'' said Cynthia Cohen Turk, president of Marketplace 2000, a retail consulting firm in Miami and New York. ``They build stores that are tourist attractions.''<P>

   Niketown wouldn't say whether it's considering the Bakery Centre. <P>

   Still negotiating are Warner Bros. Studio Stores and Barnes & Noble. ``We have some discussions with them but no commitment,'' said Chuck Gervais, a lease broker who represents Warner Bros. With Barnes & Noble, ``the deal's being negotiated,'' a source close to the discussions said.<P>

   Virgin Records, a British chain of music superstores, has said it is considering Bakery Centre among other locations for its first South Florida store. And AMC Theaters, a former tenant at the Bakery Centre, has announced it will return with a 24-screen complex.<P>

   Developers are targeting fall 1997 as the opening date, touting the rebuilt complex as an exciting focal point for South Miami.<P>

   The question is whether the developers will get the tenants.<P>

   ``With people like Niketown, it depends on what the developer has to offer them,'' Turk said. ``One the things Mel Simon has to offer is a combo deal with other properties throughout the country.''<P>

   Indeed, Simon's retail empire is expanding as he completes the acquisition of former rival DeBartolo Realty Group -- which counts among its properties Miami International Mall, Cutler Ridge Mall and part ownership of Aventura Mall.<P>

   The new company will own or manage 183 retail centers around the country, including Mall of the Americas outside Minneapolis, the largest mall in the country, and The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, the mother of all entertainment-oriented shopping centers.<P>

   That clout is what the Comras Cos., based in Miami Beach and Simon's local partner, is counting on, as it signs other tenants.<P>

   ``We've had a fair amount of success at the Simon level, and we're beginning to go to the local market now,'' said J.B. Turbidy, an attorney with the Comras Cos. ``We wouldn't be demolishing if we didn't have the backup to put it together.''
