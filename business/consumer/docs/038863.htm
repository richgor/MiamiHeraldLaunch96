   In an effort to expand its credit and charge-card operations, American Express Co. announced Thursday that it would actively court banks to issue its cards.<P>

   The announcement -- made by American Express chairman Harvey Golub at a credit card conference in Atlanta -- took public a campaign the company has been quietly waging for about a year. It also raised interest in the banking community and riled Visa USA, an Amex competitor.<P>

   ``They got religion late and realized it was a product they needed to offer (through banks) in order to survive,'' said Susan Murdy, a spokeswoman for Visa. ``They're trying to catch up, but they don't have the distribution network'' that Visa does, she said.<P>

   If banks were to issue American Express charge cards and Optima credit cards, they would be competing with their own Visa and Mastercards. Moreover, the move would break a Visa rule that bans its member banks from offering American Express cards and Dean Witter, Discover & Co.'s Dean Witter Discover cards. Mastercard does not have a comparable rule.<P>

   ``Maybe not every bank will want to work with us,'' said American Express vice chairman Kenneth Chenault. ``But we have substantially increased our overall business in the past year. And we have a lot to offer the banks. We already have an incredibly successful travelers check business with the banks.''<P>

   The idea received mixed reviews from some large banks.<P>

  Charles Walsh, head of Chase Manhattan Corp.'s Cardmembers Service Group, said the nation's No. 1 bank was not interested. He said Chase's Visa and MasterCard programs, which together have $24 billion in outstanding billings, ``support all of the needs of our customers.''<P>

   But John B. McCoy, chairman and chief executive of Banc One, said his Columbus, Ohio-based company has tested an American Express preapproved credit line for small businesses and sold its credit-processing systems to American Express. ``I have a tendency to listen when they speak,'' McCoy said.<P>

   While Amex's play is controversial, it could help solve its problems. A spate of bank-issued cards would not only increase American Express' revenues, it would reverse a slide in market share. Since 1985, American Express' share of the charge and credit card market, measured in point-of-sale retail sales, has fallen from 28 percent to 18.4 percent.
