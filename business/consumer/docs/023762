<m0> An ambitious state plan to deregulate seven professions was introduced, amended, debated, then died in the Florida Legislature.<ep>
  The net effect: Business as usual for talent agents, yacht and ship brokers, auctioneers, interior designers, landscape architects, time-share solicitors and health-care service (temporary employment) pools.<ep>
  ``We knew going in it was going to be a tough sale,'' said Ed Towey, spokesman for the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation. ``One by one, the professions were picked out of the bill. It was finally pronounced dead on Saturday. Everything stays the same.''<ep>
  That means the department will continue to license the business trades and accept consumer complaints, and various professional boards will discipline violators.<ep>
  The deregulation proposal capped an eight-month study to streamline the department, targeting business trades that receive few complaints.<ep>
  State officials said the monitoring of 36 professions was costly and time-consuming, and it was not the state's responsibility to improve specific industries. The seven professions represented only 6,500 of the 1.1 million licensees statewide.<ep>
  But professionals, who mounted formidable campaigns against the proposal, said the two-year licensing fees (--) ranging from $50 to $500 (--) fund the cost of regulations. And those rules are needed to maintain standards and build a credible industry. It's also good for business; consumers often equate a license or regulations with quality service.<ep>
  ``We are ecstatic about the regulations staying in place. Ten years ago, our rules were sunsetted and it was a zoo, with people selling boats out of the back of their trunks,'' said Peter Grimm, legislative representative and former president of the Florida Yacht Brokers Association. ``If we had been deregulated, it would have gone back to Dodge City.''<ql>
