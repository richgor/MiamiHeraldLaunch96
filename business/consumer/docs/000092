<m0>ith the shipment of its first load of Unabomber paperbacks this week, it appears that Warner Books has triumphed in a literary 100-yard dash made fierce by its tantalizing prize: a quickie book with the shelf life of a head of lettuce.<ep>
   Warner Books managed to overtake the erstwhile front-runner, Pocket Books (--) the pioneer of quickie books (--) whose fuming lawyers and top executives were left to ponder whether to defy an FBI bureaucracy that has stalled their finished book.<ep>
   ``The whole thing is just kind of annoying,'' said Mark Olshaker, the co-author of the Pocket Books manuscript, which was completed 13 days after the capture of the Unabomber suspect, Theodore J. Kaczynski, on April 3. The book was then submitted for standard review by the Federal Bureau of Investigation because its co-author, John Douglas, is a retired agent. ``If this is the FBI's idea of expediency, then I can see why it took them 18 years to catch the Unabomber,'' Olshaker said.<ep>
   In the furious world of speed literature, where books do not linger longer than the baseball season, nice publishers finish last. To be first is critical because demand slackens for second- or third-place finishers by as much as 25 percent, according to Barnes & Noble, the nation's largest bookstore chain.<ep>
   Written and sold in less than four weeks, instant books may have fleeting life spans, but they do have a long, cherished history in the publishing industry. They have flourished in more primitive forms since Pocket Books published its first quickie, a 1945 memorial that appeared six days after Franklin D. Roosevelt died. These books, in turn, spawned a class of slower-moving cousins, ``crash books,'' which are turned out, on average, in about six weeks.<ep>
   Traditionally, publishers devoted instant books or ``extras'' to weighty matters, ranging from the Kennedy assassination to the Pentagon Papers, but more recently the best-selling instant books have <m2><ql>

<m0>plumbed celebrity and true crime (--) O.J. Simpson, <m0>Long Island Lolita<m0> and <m0>Selena! The Phenomenon, Life and Tragic Death of the Tejano Music Queen.<m0><ep>
   ``They've really become trivialized in the last few years,'' said Kenneth Davis, author of <m0>Two-Bit Culture,<m0> a history of the paperback industry.<ep>
   With the focus on the sensational, a few publishers have actually refined the production of instant books into a precision drill that has its own Hollywood-style rituals to bluff the competition, lock up sales orders and ultimately emerge first with a book.<ep>
   ``If you can get into the press that you are doing a book by a certain date, even if it's unrealistic, it can help to discourage the potential competition,'' said Charles Spicer, an editor at St. Martin's Press, who has presided over so many instant books that in the trade he has been labeled the quickie book kingpin.<ep>
   At St. Martin's Press (--) which has published a modern library of crime quickies about Amy Fisher, O.J. Simpson and Jeffrey Dahmer (--) books are typically churned out in three weeks. And when there is competition, a necessary part of the production process is spying.<ep>
   ``You get neck and neck,'' Spicer said. ``You are basically trying to find out from the booksellers how fast the competition is. You constantly have your ear to the ground.''<ep>
   Timing is critical because instant books are as perishable as yesterday's headlines. Pocket Books produced an instant best seller about the slain Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla-Perez, though many people on its own staff had never heard of the star.<ep>
   <m0>The Packwood Report,<m0> essentially the Senate report about accusations of sexual misconduct against former Sen. Bob Packwood, flopped when it appeared after the senator had resigned.<ep>
   Readers have also ignored some overexposed themes (--) a spate of books about the duel between the Olympic skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan failed to attract a large number of book buyers. Kensington Publishing, which also specializes in instant crime books, could not build readership for its tale of John Wayne Bobbitt, who received widespread publicity when his estranged wife severed his penis.<ep>
   The risks are perilous to publishers who must briefly divert all their resources from their standard books and pay overtime costs to produce a quickie book. Some publishers say that a failure is not worth the gamble.<ep>
   Those were the risks that Warner Books and Pocket Books faced hours after Kaczynski's arrest in Montana. Gina Centrello, Pocket's president, was the first to announce a book, trumpeting the signing of a former FBI agent, John Douglas, an expert on serial killers who had helped prepare the psychological profile of the Unabomber.<ep>
   Douglas and his co-writer, Olshaker, had already written a best-selling book about serial killers. Given their expertise, Pocket announced an April 25 publication date (--) an unrealistic <m1> <m0>deadline. The rapid turnaround scared off other publishers, like St. Martin's and Kensington.<ep>
   But it did not deter Laurence Kirshbaum, president of Warner Books, a unit of Time Warner, which has plans to create more instant books with the resources of its magazines like Time.<ep>
   Initially, it was Pocket Books that took the lead in rapidly writing, editing, and marshaling its sales force, which generally made it to the bookstores first. But after the two writers delivered six copies of their manuscript, <m0>Unabomber: On the Trail of America's Most-Wanted Serial Killer, <m0>to the FBI on April 16, the lead vanished. Pocket Books had assumed that Douglas, as an known agency veteran, would get quick approval.<ep>
   But Pat Solley, a unit chief with the FBI, said the agency had 30 working days to complete a review. ``We're grinding on,'' she said. ``I really couldn't say when it will come.''<ep>
   Lawyers for Pocket Books have met this week with FBI lawyers to press their case for completion of the review.<ep>
   Meanwhile, Warner sped up its book production with triple shifts at a printing plant near Buffalo to move up shipment of <m0>Mad Genius: The Odyssey, Pursuit and Capture of the Suspected Unabomber.<m0><ep>
   At a black tie dinner in New York this week, the rival publishers (--) Kirshbaum and Centrello (--) politely confronted each other. Kirshbaum related the conversation: ``She said, `How come your salespeople are saying nasty things about our book?' And I said, `Our salespeople are only telling the truth (--) we will be first.'
