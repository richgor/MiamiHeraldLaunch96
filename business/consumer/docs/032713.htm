 Big Brother may be coming to a bank near you.<P>

  In a pilot program to be launched next month in Dade County, noncustomers who want to cash checks at First Union or SunTrust will be asked to leave their thumbprints along with their signatures.<P>

  Geared to combat check fraud, the inkless thumbprints will help law enforcement agencies identify criminals who have passed bogus checks. Already in place in Nevada, Arizona and Texas, the program is meant as a deterrent.<P>

  Early results show some banks have had as much as a 40 percent drop in bad checks since implementing the thumbprinting, said John Milstead, executive vice president of the Florida Bankers Association, which is spearheading the program.<P>

  And thumbprints on checks may only be the beginning. Technology is being developed to place fingerprint identifiers on the magnetic stripes of credit and ATM cards, said John Hall, spokesman for the American Bankers Association.<P>

  ``It's for the cardholders' security,'' Hall said.<P>

  During the trial program, starting in early June, First Union will ask non-account holders to stamp their right thumbprints on the backs of checks they cash. The thumbprinting, which leaves no residue or ink stain, will be used at the bank's 56 Dade branches, said spokesman Ken Darby. After one month, the bank will decide whether to expand it to the rest of the state, he said.<P>

   Beginning July 1, SunTrust will require noncustomers to stamp their thumbprints on the front of checks at its 23 branches in Dade, said spokeswoman Melissa Gracey.<P>

  At both banks, noncustomers who refuse to give their thumbprints will not be allowed to cash checks.<P>

  Barnett Bank considered joining the pilot but declined, said spokeswoman Jerri Franz. ``We looked at what it would save us versus what it would cost us, and factored in the inconvenience to the consumer,'' Franz said.<P>

  Other banks may join in later, Milstead said.<P>

  ``If we get the same results in Florida as in other states like Texas, which we fully expect we will, I think you'll see a large percentage of the industry going to this,'' he said.<P>

  Check fraud is a mounting problem in the state, Milstead said, and it has been particularly heavy during the past year. Florida banks lose as much as $100 million each year because of fraudulent checks, he said.<P>

  Still unknown is how consumers will respond to the thumbprinting practice.<P>

  Janice Shields, coordinator of the Consumer Finance Project at Ralph Nader's Center for Study of Responsive Law, in Washington, D.C., said she opposes thumbprinting. She said bank industry figures show that fraud losses amount to one penny per check, of all checks cashed nationwide, or $1.36 per bounced check.<P>

  ``Is this invasion of privacy necessary when you look at check fraud on a per-check basis?'' Shields asked. ``And there's no control over what could happen to that fingerprint. What's next? DNA samples?''<P>

  But Milstead isn't worried about a backlash from consumers.<P>

  ``I think people will understand,'' he said. ``All you're trying to do is be sure you're not giving them real money for a bogus piece of paper.''
