<m0>  A group of Salem Corp. managers has countered Miami financier Victor Posner's bid to take over the company by offering to buy the maker of industrial furnaces for about $41 million, or $22 a share.<ep>
   The buyout offer comes a month after Posner, who owns about 49 percent of Salem's common shares, offered to buy the remaining shares for $20 each.<ep>
   Posner is trying to take the Pittsburgh-based company private to circumvent a federal court order in December 1993 that bars him from being an officer or director of a public firm.<ep>
   Salem stock rose 4 percent, or 87 1/2 cents, to close at $22.25 Thursday on the American Stock Exchange.<ep>
   The management group, led by A.A. Fornataro, president, and Donald Hoylman, vice president, said Salem's acceptance of its offer would end Posner's relationship with the company.<ep>

<m0>Salem said it welcomed the offer and will respond as soon as it concludes its study.<ep>
   In April, Salem said its board was not prepared to recommend Posner's roughly $36 million-bid for the company to its shareholders ``in its current form.''<ep>
   Donald Glazer, a representative for Posner, described the management buyout offer as ``very strange.''<ep>
   ``We'd like to see what the conditions of this offer are first and to see whether this is just more stalling on behalf of the company or if it's a serious offer,' Glazer said.<ql>
