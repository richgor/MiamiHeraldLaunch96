<m0>   Shareholders of Republic Industries Inc. cheered slick plans for AutoNation USA, H. Wayne Huizenga's bold foray into the $310 billion used-car market (--) even before Huizenga announced a two-for-one stock split at Republic's annual meeting Friday.<ep>
   Then the crowd at Parker Playhouse in Fort Lauderdale really went wild. A standing ovation left Huizenga wiping <m4>Huizenga<m2><ql>
<m0>tears from his eyes, and one shareholder rose to say: ``Elvis the king just rolled over to make room for the Wayne.''<ep>
   And why shouldn't shareholders celebrate? Republic Industries' stock value rose more than 850 percent in 1995, the year Huizenga bought control of Atlanta-based Republic Waste Industries and got back into the garbage business.<ep>

<m0>Republic stock, which Huizenga bought in August for $4.50 a share, closed Friday at $41, jumping $4.25 in the aftermath of the annual meeting.<ep>
   Since August, when Huizenga became Republic's chairman and CEO, the company has bought a dozen businesses, mostly garbage haulers and electronics security firms. And in six weeks, shareholders will vote on buying AutoNation, which has yet to open its first store, in a $250 million stock deal.<ep>
   Huizenga, who grew Waste Management of Chicago and Blockbuster Video into mega-companies, told shareholders he wants to build Republic into ``one of the world's premiere diversified companies.''<ep>
   Until Friday, AutoNation executives had remained tight-lipped about plans for their used-car superstores that will feature no-haggle pricing and ``sales guides'' paid a salary rather than commission.<ep>
   Republic wants to establish AutoNation as the top national brand in a market without one (--) just as Huizenga did with Blockbuster Video. Huizenga's protege, Steven R. Berrard, former president of Blockbuster Entertainment, is now AutoNation's chief executive and, pending shareholders' approval, president and COO of Republic.<ep>
   Berrard said AutoNation's first store will open in Coconut Creek in September and four more will follow this year in Texas. By 2000, 80 stores are planned.<ep>
   AutoNation's primary competition will be CarMax, Circuit City's superstore with four locations; and Driver's Mart Worldwide of Grand Rapids, Mich., featuring a group of car dealers with 118 dealerships nationwide including South Florida father-son auto moguls Albert and Michael Maroone.<ep>
   AutoNation's stores will feature an inventory of at least 1,000 ``reconditioned to-be-like new'' vehicles. Each 30,000 square-foot store will include a beverage bar, children's play area and an AutoNotion'sshop that sells vehicle accessories. <m1><ep>
<m0>   There will be a 99-day, 3,300-mile warranty, a seven-day money-back guarantee and free roadside service for a year. AutoNation will also service vehicles. The company plans ``heavy advertising,'' mostly on television. AutoNation's chief marketing officer Tom Gruber unveiled AutoNation's logo (--) it looks like a highway sign.<ep>
   Huizenga thanked Republic chief financial officer Gregory K. Fairbanks, who resigned Thursday, for his service. <ep>
   ``There are things in my personal life I need to devote more attention to,'' Fairbanks said, adding that he plans to remain a large Republic shareholder. <m1>  <m2><ep>
