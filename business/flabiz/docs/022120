<m0>   Greenwich Air Services said net income rose 76 percent in its second quarter, primarily because of higher sales and lower interest expense.<ep>
   Net sales rose 36 percent in the quarter, the company said. Meanwhile, about $13 million in 8 percent convertible debt was converted to stock in the first and second quarters, saving the company about $300,000 a quarter in interest expense.<ep>
   Greenwich said it expects its $250 million acquisition of Aviall's engine maintenance division to be completed by the end of June.<ep>
   Last week, the company declared a dividend of one share of Class B non-voting stock for each share of Class A common stock. A new issue of additional Class B stock is expected to raise about $75 million, to help finance the acquisition.<ql>

<m0>  Unite, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, said the licensed practical nurses at Hebrew Home for the Aged in North Miami Beach have voted to unionize.<ep>
   The vote count among the bargaining unit of 15 nurses was 12-0, the union said. The home's staff of about 60 nursing assistants, housekeepers and laundry and food workers voted in March to unionize, although the home has filed objections to the vote with the National Labor Relations Board.<ep>
   ``This will be an inspiration for other nurses in nursing homes across Florida,'' said Monica Russo, southern organizing director for Unite.<ep>

<m0>  Servico, a West Palm Beach-based hotel operator, said Friday it has refinanced debt on 20 of its 58 hotels and will put the $31.5 million in proceeds toward buying more hotels. The $123.2 million in new debt is on hotels in Florida and 12 other states.<ep>
   Chief executive David Buddemeyer said the net would be used to reach the company's goal of acquiring $100 million in hotel properties this year. He also said Lehman Brothers Holdings, the lender in the refinancing, ``has indicated a willingness to participate in the financing'' of the acquisitions.<ep>
   Servico has primarily full-service hotels affiliated with national chains in 20 states and Puerto Rico. With more than $350 million in assets, the company is one of the largest hotel owner/operators in the United States.<ql>
