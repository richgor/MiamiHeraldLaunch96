   A Dade jury has awarded $79,000 to a hotel sales manager who was fired because she did not return to work as quickly as her bosses wanted after her child was delivered stillborn. <P>

   Maria Chinea, 29, earned $30,000 a year coordinating U.S. sales from Miami for a Dominican hotel chain called Hotelero Naco Inc., which operates properties in Santo Domingo and Puerto Plata.<P>

   When she told her employer she was pregnant, Chinea requested and received eight weeks of maternity leave. But after she lost the baby in April 1993, the hoteliers ordered her to return before the leave expired.<P>

   ``You have to ask yourself, does this make sense?'' attorney Alice Warwick asked the jury.<P>

   Defense lawyer Scott McNary argued that it made eminent sense. Chinea, he said, was uncommunicative after she lost the baby, and company executives received anonymous reports that she had been spotted at shopping malls, appearing quite healthy.<P>

   During a trial before Circuit Judge Alan Postman this week, Chinea denied the allegations. She testified that she was an emotional wreck, in extreme pain and in no condition to resume duties that included transcontinental trips to trade shows.<P>

   ``Mainly, I spent the time in bed,'' she said. Her husband, Carlos, testified that his wife couldn't drive, let alone shop.<P>

   The company, though, was restless. Three weeks into her leave, an executive in Miami hand-delivered a letter that demanded her return to work. Fearful for her job, Chinea reported to her Miami office a week later. But it was too late. Johnny Bernal, a vice president and her immediate supervisor, terminated Chinea by fax from the Dominican Republic.<P>

   In a deposition, Bernal testified that sales were sliding and Chinea's services were urgently needed.<P>

   Chinea countered that at the very least, she was entitled to the entire eight weeks' leave to recuperate.<P>

   But executives insisted that since there was no baby, Chinea was obligated to return early. And McNary argued that Chinea had a more ``assertive'' and ``aggressive'' personality than she exhibited on the witness stand.<P>

   The jury disagreed. The panel awarded Chinea back pay, as well as money for mental anguish and loss of dignity.<P>

   McNary said he intends to appeal.
