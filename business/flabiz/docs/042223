<m0>   Merrett R. Stierheim, president of the Greater Miami Convention & Visitors Bureau, has been named Tourism Professional of the Year by the Dade County Academy of Travel and Tourism. The Academy is a partnership between the Dade County School Board, The National Academy Foundation and private industry tourism executives.<ep>
   The award is given annually to the person who has made the most sig<m4>Stierheim<m2><ql>
<m0>nificant contribution to the South Florida tourism community. Stierheim has been bureau president since 1990.<ep>
   In 1994, when tourism to Dade dropped dramatically after a series of tourist murders, Stierheim helped create a number of tourism safety initiatives. Since then, tourism <m1> <m0>to Dade has increased significantly. For the first three months of 1996, 2.7 million visitors came to Dade, an record for tourism in the first quarter.<ep>

<m0>   Capital Factors Holding Inc., a Fort Lauderdale-based subsidiary of Capital Bank, has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering of 2 million shares of Capital Factors Holding Inc. common stock, which will represent about 17 percent of the outstanding shares.<ep>
   Oppenheimer & Co. will manage the underwriting group. An over-allotment option could increase the size of the offering to 2.3 million shares of common stock, the company said. Net proceeds from the proposed offering are expected to be used to reduce outstanding debt.<ep>
   Capital Factors provides receivables-based commercial financing and related fee-based credit, collection and management information services. <m1><ql>

<m0>  The newest airplane model built by Brazilian manufacturer Embraer made its first U.S. appearance this week in Fort Lauderdale.<ep>
   The 50-seat, twin-engine Embraer EMB-145 began a 13-city tour in Fort Lauderdale at Embraer's U.S. headquarters, which houses marketing, training, parts and technical service offices and employs about 75 people.<ep>
   The plane sells for about $15 million. Embraer spokesman Idan Sims said the manufacturer has orders from BWIA as well as several Australian and Brazilian carriers.<ep>

<m1>   <m0>Mortgage rates should head downward this week, following activity in the stock and bond markets Friday, said Robert Heady, publisher of North Palm Beach-based Bank Rate Monitor.<ep>
   ``With today's rally and a drop in the bond yields, mortgage rates should move back down by about 1/8 of a percent,'' Heady said late Friday.<ep>
   As of Wednesday, 15 and 30-year fixed rates had hit their highest level in more than a year. The rates climbed 20 and 19 basis points, for 15 and 30-year mortgages, respectively, to national averages of 7.73 and 8.2 percent. Average rates in Miami were higher, at 7.9 and 8.36 percent, respectively, for 15 and 30-year fixed mortgages.<ep>
