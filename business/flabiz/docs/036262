<m0>  Sensormatic Electronics Corp. said Monday it laid off 280 workers last quarter and billed itself $42.5 million to restructure the company and return it to profitability.<ep>
  The Boca Raton-based maker of anti-theft and security systems had warned investors of the actions in February. But when the smoke cleared, the tab for cutting the work force and consolidating facilities came in 37 percent higher than originally predicted.<ep>
  ``We are six months into an aggressive restructuring program that will lower our expenses and asset levels, improve our processes and systems and result in quality growth,'' said Robert Vanourek, Sensormatic's president and chief operating officer.<ep>
  Ronald Assaf, the company's chairman and chief executive, blamed the downsizing for a meager 3.2 percent increase in revenue. Sensormatic reported $225 million in revenue for the three months ended March 31, giving it $737 million over nine months and putting it within reach of the $1 billion annual sales mark with one quarter to go.<ep>
  Sensormatic has laid off 800 employees, or 11 percent of its global work force, since Vanourek joined the company last October. It posted a $65.1 million net loss in the second quarter. In the latest quarter, the restructuring costs and a massive set-aside for inventory and receivables led to <m4>  Vanourek<m2><ql>
<m0>a $50 million net loss.<ep>
  Without the one-time charges against earnings, Sensormatic would have shown operating income of $1 million, <m2><ql>

<m0>compared with $22.9 million in the same quarter a year ago.<ep>
  The announcement of the hefty net loss was softened by other company news, and Sensormatic shares fell $1 to close at $19.62 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.<ep>
  Sensormatic said Big B Drug Stores of Bessemer, Ala., has agreed to install Sensormatic's Ultra-Max anti-theft system in 331 additional stores. Big B already uses Ultra-Max in 61 stores. It is the nation's 10th biggest drugstore chain, with stores in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee.<ep>
  The company also named two new vice presidents Monday. John D. Cronan, former vice president of finance and planning at Scott Paper Co., was named Sensormatic's vice president and controller. Richard C. DeCook, formerly chief financial officer at Wackenhut Corp., was named vice president and treasurer.<ql>
