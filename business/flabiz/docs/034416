   In the first collaboration between two of South Florida's most seasoned developers, Michael Swerdlow plans to build a retail and entertainment center at Armando Codina's giant planned industrial complex in West Dade.<ep>
   Swerdlow said Monday that he plans to buy a 90-acre parcel at the south end of Codina's proposed Beacon TradePort at the intersection of the turnpike and State Road 836, just west of Miami International Mall. Neither he nor Armando Codina, chief executive of the Codina Group, would disclose the purchase price, but Swerdlow is buying about one-fourth of a 373-acre parcel said to cost a total of more than $25 million.<ep>
   The deal is expected to close in about six to eight months, simultaneously with Codina's purchase of the entire property from a Chinese investment group. The land, under contract since November, is now in the permitting and planning stages. Zoned agricultural, it has been used for cattle grazing.<ep>
   Beacon TradePort will be Codina's largest and most ambitious project to date, with than 250 acres of high-end warehouses.<ep>
   The retail and entertainment component, called Dolphin Center at Beacon TradePort, will most likely take the form of an enclosed mall, said Swerdlow, chairman of the Michael Swerdlow Co. Expected to open in two years, the center will have 24 movie screens, stores and restaurants, with ``an entertainment area for families with small children and another area devoted to grown-ups,'' he said.<ep>
   ''We're hoping to make it a real regional draw,'' Swerdlow said, citing the complex's excellent location and access to major roads.<ep>
   ''I think there's no better location in South Florida than this one,'' he said. ``That's where the population is moving, and there's tremendous tourist potential from the airport and seaport. If they can get to Sawgrass Mills, they can certainly <m2><ql>

   Swerdlow is acquiring the land with long-term partners Nelson Peltz and Peter May. He said he expects Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based investment group that recently invested in Cypress Creek Station in Fort Lauderdale, to provide equity for the entertainment and retail center. Swerdlow said the total investment ``may be significantly more than $80 million.''<ep>
   The pairing of Swerdlow and Codina brings two of South Florida's development gurus to booming West Dade.<ep>
   In the past five years, Codina's company has developed 500 acres of industrial space in the area. Among projects either completed or in the works are Beacon Centre, Beacon Industrial Park, Beacon North and Beacon at 97th Avenue and Beacon West.<ep>
   Swerdlow adds years of retail development expertise. His company has built and leased more than 3 million square feet of retail space in South Florida in the past several years. The Hollywood-based firm is currently developing four other major projects with retail and entertainment components, including Brickell Station in downtown Fort Lauderdale and West Fork in western Pembroke Pines.<ep>
   W. Allen Morris, president and chief executive officer of The Allen Morris Company, said his firm listed the 373-acres site in August for $30 million. His father, L. Allen Morris, had recommended the purchase of the property to the Chinese group as a long-term hold. They purchased it in June 1965, for $625,500. Morris said he suggested the owners sell now because he feels the area is ready for development.<ep>
   Residential and industrial development in West Dade has mushroomed in recent years.<ep>
   Demand for land continues to be strong, and supply is limited, said both Morris and Lee Katsikos, sales manager for the Doran Jason Group of Miami.<ep>
   Because of the area's proximity to Miami International Airport and the Port of Miami, Katsikos said industrial space is running at a 95 percent occupancy level. He calls it ``the strongest industrial market in the country.''<ep>
   And Codina's projects have ``set the standard for West Dade that everyone has been trying to emulate,'' Katsikos said.<ep>
   The coupling of Codina and Swerdlow should add yet another dimension, he said.<ep>
   ''I think it's a major powerhouse,'' Katsikos said. ``And I consider it a major coup for the area.''<m2><ep>
