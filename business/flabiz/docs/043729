<m0>  Precision Response Corp., a Miami Lakes company that has grown into one of the country's top telemarketing firms, has decided to sell stock to the public to finance further growth.<ep>
   The company, which answers customer-service calls for large corporations, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering.<ep>
   The company wants to offer up to 3.45 million shares of stock to repay debt, make earnings distributions to its shareholders and fund expansion.<ep>
   Precision executives declined to comment on the offering, citing SEC regulations.<ep>
   Precision's revenues have increased from $16.2 million in 1991 to $30.2 million in 1995. Net income has fluctuated, from $1.8 million in 1991 to $1.5 million in 1995. The balance on a $15 million, three-year credit line and on vari<m2><ql>

   Founder and Chief Executive Mark Gordon and President David Epstein are the major shareholders.<ep>
   Gordon founded the company in 1982 as Florida Fulfillment, mailing brochures and other promotional information on behalf of corporate clients. It had only two telephones.<ep>
   Gordon bought out two of the company's partners and steered Florida Fulfillment into telephones and marketing. In 1991, Gordon and co-owner Epstein changed the firm's name to Precision Response.<ep>
   Today, the company ranks among the country's top 20 telemarketing firms. In its six telephone call centers, more than 2,000 employees answer customer-service calls for clients such as AT&T, Taco Bell, Anheuser-Busch and British Airways.<ep>
   The bulk of the business, 76.5 percent of 1995 revenues, came from its five largest clients.<ep>
   The share price of the public offering will be determined in late June, according to a spokeswoman for Dain Bosworth, the underwriter.<ql>
