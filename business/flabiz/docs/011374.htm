 Perfumania, a Miami perfume retailer, plans to buy the retail division and part of the wholesale operation of competitor Model Imperial in a deal that would give Perfumania 650 more retail outlets and bail out financially troubled Model Imperial.<P>

  The sale, announced Wednesday, involves two letters of intent. One is for Perfumania to buy all of Boca Raton-based Model Imperial's retail operations. The second is to buy 51 percent of what remains of Model Imperial.<P>

  The transactions are subject to approval by Model Imperial's lenders -- who had pressured the company to shrink and pay off a $50 million debt -- and to final review and audits of Model Imperial's 1995 financial statements, on which the company requested an extension.<P>

  Model Imperial, solely a wholesaler until 1993, expects losses of more than $20 million for 1995. The company blames its financial woes on the rapid expansion of its retail operation, which grew to 650 leased departments inside other retailers' stores in two years. Model Imperial has been operating under a forbearance agreement with its bank lenders. Its shares have fallen from $6.12 in March 1995 to 75 cents Wednesday.<P>

  Model Imperial is counting on proceeds from the Perfumania deal to wipe out its debt, now $42 million. After the deal, it would continue to operate as a wholesaler, with the infusion of capital from Perfumania's 51 percent stock purchase.<P>

  ``This deal will essentially take the bank out,'' said Leonard Silverstein, Model Imperial's chief financial officer. ``The company was profitable every year except 1995, and there's no reason to think it would go back to wholesale and not be profitable.''<P>

  The deal would give Perfumania, which has 196 stores, a rapid expansion of 650 perfume departments, an addition that Perfumania Chairman Simon Falic described as basically payroll-free, because the in-store gondolas are mostly self-serve. Perfumania would pay the stores a percentage of sales.<P>

  Model Imperial's two South Florida locations are inside Burlington Coat Factory stores in Hialeah and Sunrise.<P>

  ``We're set up to run this,'' Falic said. ``They weren't.''<P>

  Perfumania would pay the book value of Model Imperial retail inventory and assets. The price for the common stock of the remaining company would be determined when the final audits and reviews are conducted.<P>

  The revenue that could be generated from the retail inventory is estimated at $40 million to $50 million, said Richard W. Edelman, an analyst with Southwest Securities Group in Boca Raton.<P>

  ``I think it's great for Perfumania,'' Edelman said. ``This volume will be at that level or higher once Perfumania takes over and re-merchandises their shelves. In addition, Perfumania has an option to buy 51 percent of the business of Model, which will be stronger without the retail operation.''<P>

  Perfumania stock closed at $6.50 Wednesday, up 62 cents.
