<m0>  Single-family, existing-home sales rose 11 percent statewide during the first quarter of 1996 compared with the same period last year, the Florida Association of Realtors reported Thursday.<ep>
   Sales in both Miami and Fort Lauderdale increased 10 percent in the first quarter of 1996.<ep>
   The group attributed higher sales to lower interest rates. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 7.34 percent from an average of 8.79 percent during the first quarter of last year, the association said.<ql>

<m0>  The Metro-Dade Commission approved a zoning application Thursday that will allow AutoNation USA to build its first used-car superstore in Dade County. An attorney for the Fort Lauderdale company said AutoNation plans to invest $10 million to open a 32,000-square-foot showroom on 15 acres at South Dixie Highway and Southwest 174th Street.<ep>
   The company said it expects to employ 130 people at an average salary of $30,000. Community leaders said the project could spark other development in an area still suffering the aftershocks of Hurricane Andrew.<ep>
   ``If we get this project approved, we can truly start to redevelop this area,'' said Steve Cranman, executive director of the Perrine Cutler Ridge Council.<ql>

<m0>  CHS Electronics of Miami, a major exporter of computer equipment and software to Europe and Latin America, reported a 19 percent increase in first-quarter net earnings Thursday.<ep>
   The company also posted a 48 percent jump in sales, due mainly to acquisitions. Aside from the acquisitions, CHS said demand for microcomputer products remains strong in both Europe and Latin America. CHS is the largest distributor of Hewlett-Packard printers in South America, the third-largest in Europe.<ql>

<m0>  Parlux Fragrances said Haas Wheat & Partners Inc. agreed to invest $40 million in the fragrance and cosmetics company.<ep>
   The investment, which is expected to close by the end of the summer, will be structured as a 10 percent pay-in-kind bond, which pays interest in the form of additional bonds, Parlux said.<ep>
   Dallas-based Haas Wheat, a private investment firm, also will receive warrants to purchase up to 5 million Parlux common shares (--) or about 25 percent of the fully diluted equity ownership (--) at $11 a share, the company said.<ep>
   Proceeds from the investment will be used to retire long-term debt and for general corporate purposes, including small acquisitions, Ilia Lekach, Parlux's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.<ep>
   ``A partnership with the Haas Wheat firm will assist us in achieving the growth potential of Parlux Fragrances,'' Lekach said.<ep>
   The Fort Lauderdale-based fragrance and cosmetics company, with 1995 revenue of $38.2 million, holds licenses to distribute several designer brands, including Perry Ellis, Todd Oldham and Fred Hayman Beverly Hills.<ep>
