<m0>  Joseph S. Travers, a Dade real estate entrepreneur, made news this month when the Wall Street Journal described him as a confidence man who allegedly duped Floridians into giving up their houses, leaving them with only the debt.<ep>
   Now, Travers, 53, is in trouble with federal authorities. He was arraigned Thursday in U.S. District Court in Miami after federal housing agents arrested him at his Bay Harbor Islands home. They charged him with violating federal mail fraud laws.<ep>
   According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Travers, using the name Larry Thomas, fraudulently obtained deeds to two Orlando homes with mortgages guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. His dealings didn't end there, authorities said.<ep>
   In court papers, agents allege Travers controls 40 federally insured properties in Florida that do not belong to him. He is also alleged to have received rental payments on the properties while failing to make payment on the mortgages.<ep>
   ``Property owners across the state of Florida have been cheated,'' said U.S. Attorney Kendall Coffey. ``We intend to conduct a full investigation.''<ep>
   In a scheme called ``equity skimming'' by the government, Travers allegedly positioned himself as a buyer of properties, but arranged for the original owners to remain liable for the mortgages without knowing it. Some of the properties went into default.<ep>
   In a search of Travers' belongings, agents found more than $67,000 in cash, an $8,900 cashier's check, equipment for a notary public and aliases on legal documents. Among other papers: blank grand jury subpoenas, two passports and a valid visa to China.<ep>
   Travers' wife, who is from Taiwan, reportedly told agents the couple was preparing to move. In court, Travers called that a ``lie,'' adding that the couple had lived in Miami for 29 years.<ep>
