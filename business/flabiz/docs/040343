<m0>  Certified Vacations said chief executive Michael F. Stone has quit, and the Fort Lauderdale-based tour operator will be run by an Alamo Rent-A-Car executive until a replacement is found. Alamo Chairman Mike Egan owns the large travel company.<ep>
   After four years as president, Stone, 46, is leaving ``to pursue several new opportunities,'' according to a statement from Egan. Alamo's vice chairman and chief operating officer Roger Ballou, a travel industry veteran, will temporarily manage the company.<ep>
   Certified, which cut 42 people from its work force in January, employs more than 800 people in Fort Lauderdale and 90 in Salt Lake City.<ql>

<m0>  Royce Laboratories and its chairman reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with an investigation into possible violations of federal securities laws.<ep>
   Royce Labs is a Miami-based maker of generic drugs. The SEC investigation focused on disclosures made by the company between July 1991 and April 1992 regarding the status of its abbreviated new drug applications for Piroxicam and Minoxidil. The probe also concerned sales of Royce Labs' securities.<ep>
   Chairman Patrick J. McEnany agreed to pay a $25,000 administrative fine to defray some of the SEC's expenses for the investigation. McEnany and Royce also agreed to a civil injunction requiring them to comply with federal securities laws in the future, though they neither admitted nor denied a violation had occurred.<ql>

<m0>   All American Semiconductor of Miami said it has received a $100 million credit line from a bank group led by American National Bank & Trust of Chicago and Harris Trust & Savings Bank.<ep>
   The five-year secured credit line replaces both the company's $45 million credit line and its $15 million in subordinated bank debt. The distributor of electronic components said the availability of a larger amount of capital will enhance its ability to expand.<ep>

<m0>  French Fragrances, a Miami Lakes-based perfume distributor, plans to sell 4.75 million shares of stock, according to a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.<ep>
   The company plans to raise about $19 million through the sale of 3 million shares, said the statement filed Friday with the SEC. Existing investors including chief executive Rafael Kravec will sell another 1.75 million. Kravec will sell 475,000 shares, cutting his stake to 2.47 million shares, or 19.4 percent.<ep>
