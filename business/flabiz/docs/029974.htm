 Tom Culley, author of Beating the Odds in Small Business, is attempting to do just that.<P>

  His small business is his new book, an opus with an attitude.<P>

  He abandoned his consulting work to write it. He laid it out on a computer in the bedroom-office of his Coconut Grove apartment. He formed a company, Small Business Matters Inc., to print the book after contracts with two publishers could not survive his exacting style.<P>

  Now, he's marketing Beating the Odds with a feverish persistence, following his book's advice to put your new small business first.<P>

  In colorful, and sometimes off-color, language (Culley even manages to slip a four-letter word onto the cover), the 412-page text describes the ``realities of the business jungle.'' The book, like its author, is funny and irreverent, opinionated and pushy. He backs up his points with blurbs from newspapers and magazines.<P>

  ``The book is the result of a whole lot of things that happened to me and made me weird enough to write it,'' says Culley, 57, sitting in the apartment he shares with three Siamese cats. ``This book was written out of conviction. I'm also a businessman. I saw an opportunity.''<P>

  Culley aims his message at ``Middle America,'' including laid-off workers disillusioned with the corporate world. And the message to people starting their own business is: ``You have to be utterly cynical.''<P>

  ``The book is designed to prevent disaster, and if I need to be brutally frank to do it, so be it,'' he says. ``And if that offends some people, so be it.''<P>

  Culley concludes in Chapter Four (The Welcoming Committee: Watch Your Back . . . Hide Your Wallet) that established businesses intentionally rip off ``green and gullible'' newcomers to such an extent that it's the ``principal underlying cause of most small business failures'' in their first two years. Culley calls this ``The Cannibal Syndrome.''<P>

  He writes of lawyers as ``plagues,'' franchising as ``risky'' and overrated. He warns potential business owners to have the proper capital to stay alive: ``Profitable, well-managed, beautiful little businesses can and do die the dumbest of deaths. They die of thirst.''<P>

  Culley's direct manner has attracted fans like Phyllis Borenstein, who with her husband Richard, ``a frustrated accountant,'' opened The Big Tomato, a carry-out cafe in South Dade specializing in gourmet tomato pies and salads. The business is almost 2 years old and ``over the hump finan<BR>
<BR>

cially.''<P>

  Borenstein said Culley's Dear Reader letter brought tears to her eyes. She was so moved by his understanding of the small-business plight that she faxed Culley a letter. ``I wish I would have had this book two years ago. I would have been a lot more prepared,'' says Borenstein, a one-time Realtor.<P>

  Borenstein says she needed his advice on personnel -- Employees Make or Break Your Business -- before starting her cafe. ``I was so busy worrying about making a product somebody would love, I didn't even think about employees,'' she says. ``Employees are very stressful.''<P>

  Culley was born in Brazil to British parents. His father ran a flour mill. At 10, he was shipped off to boarding school in England, returning at 17 to work in a family insurance business.<P>

  At 24, he persuaded the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania to admit him into the MBA program even though he had never been to college. ``I studied terribly hard, and I graduated first in my class,'' he says. (Wharton doesn't keep class rankings but confirmed he graduated in 1965.) ``It was determination and fear that got me through.''<P>

  With a business partner who had capital, Culley returned to Brazil and started developing convenience stores. ``We were a huge success and then we went bankrupt. That taught me much more than anything I learned at Wharton. We were too cocky. We weren't watching the cash flow.''<P>

  Culley worked for management consultants McKinsey & Co. in Ohio and Portugal before returning to Brazil to work for, start and run a variety of small companies. He is divorced, with three grown children, and recently settled in Miami.<P>

  Mitchell Kaplan, owner of Books & Books in Coral Gables and Miami Beach, has helped Culley promote his book. Culley gave out Books & Books' phone number when he was on a talk radio show that aired in St. Louis. ``We got tons of calls and letters,'' Kaplan says, ``which tells me that people respond to him in some way. He translates some of his own dynamism into the book, and he's a pretty dynamic guy.''<P>

  Culley says he and three partners have invested $100,000 into his book venture. He published 5,000 copies. The book sells for $29.95; as a self-publisher, he nets $15 on each sale. His book recently was accepted by Barnes & Noble, the nation's biggest bookstore chain.<P>

  Marcella Smith, business director of small presses for Barnes & Noble, says ``it's too soon to say'' if Culley's work will stand out among other business books.<P>

  Culley says Beating the Odds will beat the odds if people want the cold truth instead of ``sentimental goo.''<P>

  ``Small business has become trendy; it's the object of hype. Nobody says: `It's rough, it's hard.' The question is,'' he says, ``do people want to read about reality or do they want to read about dreams?''
