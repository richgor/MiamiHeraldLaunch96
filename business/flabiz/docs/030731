<m0>  Benihana keeps cashing in on the sushi craze. The Miami company that has added sushi bars at 20 of the 46 Japanese restaurants it owns or licenses, recorded a 60 percent increase in profits for the year ended March 31.<ep>
   Benihana's annual revenues also increased 11 percent. Same store sales for the year (--) and the guest count (--) were up about 8 percent.<ep>
   Benihana President Joel Schwartz attributed the profitable year to the popularity of the sushi bars, seven of which were added last year, and the upgrading of existing restaurants, which cost $3 million.<ep>
   Last year, the company also introduced its first Benihana Grill in Sacramento, Calif., ``an intimate version of our traditional restaurant allowing penetration of markets that were not feasible for free-standing Benihana restaurants,'' Schwartz said in a statement.<ep>
   Two more Benihana Grills are planned for the current year.<ql>

<m0>  Despite a dip in sales, earnings increased 67 percent at Catalina Lighting, a Miami-based manufacturer and distributor of lighting products. Lower inventory levels, leading to lower interest expenses, led to the higher gross profits, the company said.<ql>

<m0>ADT Ltd.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  The adoption of an accounting rule pertaining to long-lived assets led to a $379.1 million first-quarter loss at ADT Ltd. of Boca Raton.<ep>
   The writedown of certain assets to their estimated fair values resulted in a $410.1 million non-cash charge against earnings during the three months ended March 31. Had it not been for the accounting rule, ADT would have posted a profit of $31 million, or 14 percent higher than the same quarter last year. First-quarter sales were 5 percent lower than a year ago, but only because ADT sold two European business units that accounted for $54.5 million in the first quarter of 1995.<ep>
   ADT is the largest supplier of electronic security services in North America and the second-largest provider of vehicle auction services in the United States.<ql>
