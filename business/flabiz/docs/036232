<m0>  When BellSouth cable splicers and technicians come calling in Central and North Dade neighborhoods, from now on they'll be in uniform.<ep>
   Eventually, all in-field workers in BellSouth's nine-state territory will wear uniforms.<ep>
   The switch to uniforms is designed to provide security for customers, who will be able to identify company employees, BellSouth officials said. It will also be good advertising for the company.<ep>
   The uniforms (--) red, white or blue shirts, and blue or khaki pants, skirts and shorts (--) made their debut this week.<ep>
   Later this month, they will be phased in for BellSouth technicians in Broward and South Dade. Some 4,000 Dade and Broward workers will sport the outfits, which also include jackets and caps.<ep>
   In an era where long-distance carriers, local phone companies, and cable television and wireless companies will be competing, analysts say the advantage goes to the company that keeps its name before customers.<ep>
   ``We want our customers to know, without a doubt, that when we come to your front door, you're dealing with BellSouth,'' said Spero Canton, a company spokesman.<ql>
