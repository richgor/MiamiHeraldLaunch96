   A florist by any other name is simply not the same.<ep>
   Just ask Exotic Gardens, a local chain where owners are facing Mother's Day, the biggest floral holiday of the year, without their name in the Greater Miami Yellow Pages.<ep>
   To make matters worse, a similar-sounding company <m1> <m0>(--) Boston-based Exotic Flowers <m1> <m0>(--) has a large ad and listing in the phone book. That name is drawing unsuspecting Exotic Gardens customers. Ironically, local orders placed with the out-of-town company are routed to Exotic Gardens. <m1> <ep>
<m0>   However, customers calling the Boston company to place orders for local deliveries may end up paying a wire transfer fee or higher arrangement prices.<ep>
   The result: A very thorny situation.<ep>
   ``Our business has definitely been impacted by this,'' said Bonnie Jones, owner of the four Exotic Gardens stores. ``One of the big problems is that Exotic Flowers is based in Massachusetts, but has a local number listed in the book. So people think they are calling us. It's certainly confusing.''<ep>
   Exotic Flowers officials did not return messages left by The Herald.<ep>
   Alan Krevis, a five-year Exotic Gardens customer, called Exotic Flowers to send an arrangement for Hanukkah.<ep>
   ``First, I asked for the person who I normally deal with,'' he recalled. ``They said he was not in. When they asked my name, they said there was no record of previous orders I had made. I thought that was strange since I had just ordered arrangements for my parents wedding anniversary in November,'' Krevis said. ``Once I realized they were not Exotic Gardens, I didn't bother to place the order.''<ep>
   Jones and BellSouth officials said an ``oversight'' resulted in Exotic Gardens' name and Miami phone number not being listed in the Yellow Pages, which is distributed each August. <m1><ep>
<m0>   BellSouth spokesman Spero Canton said Exotic Flowers is allowed to use a local number because it notes in the ad that it is based in Boston.<ep>
   Last April (--) before the ad ran (--) the local florist filled 11 Exotic Flowers orders. This April, that number jumped to 157, Jones said.<ep>
   Jones said not much can be done except to send a notice to the 30,000 customers on her mailing list. But that would be costly.<ep>
   ``This is a mess,'' she said. ``All I can do is wait for the next telephone book to come out.''<ep>
