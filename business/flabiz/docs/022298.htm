   A florist by any other name is simply not the same.<P>

   Just ask Exotic Gardens, a local chain where owners are facing Mother's Day, the biggest floral holiday of the year, without their name in the Greater Miami Yellow Pages.<P>

   To make matters worse, a similar-sounding company -- Boston-based Exotic Flowers -- has a large ad and listing in the phone book. That name is drawing unsuspecting Exotic Gardens customers. Ironically, local orders placed with the out-of-town company are routed to Exotic Gardens.    However, customers calling the Boston company to place orders for local deliveries may end up paying a wire transfer fee or higher arrangement prices.<P>

   The result: A very thorny situation.<P>

   ``Our business has definitely been impacted by this,'' said Bonnie Jones, owner of the four Exotic Gardens stores. ``One of the big problems is that Exotic Flowers is based in Massachusetts, but has a local number listed in the book. So people think they are calling us. It's certainly confusing.''<P>

   Exotic Flowers officials did not return messages left by The Herald.<P>

   Alan Krevis, a five-year Exotic Gardens customer, called Exotic Flowers to send an arrangement for Hanukkah.<P>

   ``First, I asked for the person who I normally deal with,'' he recalled. ``They said he was not in. When they asked my name, they said there was no record of previous orders I had made. I thought that was strange since I had just ordered arrangements for my parents wedding anniversary in November,'' Krevis said. ``Once I realized they were not Exotic Gardens, I didn't bother to place the order.''<P>

   Jones and BellSouth officials said an ``oversight'' resulted in Exotic Gardens' name and Miami phone number not being listed in the Yellow Pages, which is distributed each August. <P>

   BellSouth spokesman Spero Canton said Exotic Flowers is allowed to use a local number because it notes in the ad that it is based in Boston.<P>

   Last April -- before the ad ran -- the local florist filled 11 Exotic Flowers orders. This April, that number jumped to 157, Jones said.<P>

   Jones said not much can be done except to send a notice to the 30,000 customers on her mailing list. But that would be costly.<P>

   ``This is a mess,'' she said. ``All I can do is wait for the next telephone book to come out.''
