ther airports want to eat Miami's lunch.<P>

   For years, Miami has feasted on its historic dominance over traffic between the United States and Latin America. That dominance became even more pronounced in the 1990s, when Latin America's economies surged at the same time as American Airlines was focusing its massive resources on building a Latin American hub in Miami.<P>

   Now competitors, particularly Continental Airlines hubs in Houston and Newark, are challenging Miami. Though chances that they could succeed in toppling Miami International Airport are slim, the landscape and the players are certain to change.<P>

   But not immediately. Today, Miami's airport has 70 percent of all U.S. scheduled nonstop service to South America, and 56 percent of all service to Central America. It has four times as many flights to South America and three times as many flights to Central America as its closest competitors.<P>

   It is also South Florida's most important source of employment, with 30,000 workers onsite and another 176,000 in related jobs.<BR>
Envy's understandable<P>

   Competing airports can be excused if they are envious. They see that one relatively small, often congested, increasingly expensive facility (thanks to a $3.5 billion construction project) controls one of the most valuable markets in world aviation. And they wonder how they can get a bigger share of the pie.<P>

   In fact, aided by the U.S. Department of Transportation, they can. The agency's oft-stated policy, in Latin America as in Europe, is to expand the number of U.S. gateways with nonstop, foreign service.<P>

      Already, Continental plays up its ability to provide an alternative to Miami, in Houston. In various Latin American newspapers, it advertises daily flights to U.S. destinations via its hub at Houston Intercontinental Airport, which it calls ``the most convenient port of entry to North America.''<P>

   In Houston, the ad points out, ``Your process of entering the United States will be rapid and easy, permitting you to connect to your final destination in as little as 50 minutes, compared with 90 in Miami.''<BR>
Continental looks south<P>

  Continental continues to add Latin service. Last week, it was tentatively awarded a Houston-Lima route, complimenting the Newark-Lima route it began flying last month. The airline also plans to start service from Houston to Quito and Guayaquil in Ecuador in July and has applied to serve Sao Paulo, Brazil, from Newark, starting in December.<P>

  In addition, the Colombian government is considering bids from American to provide daily service from Bogota to Kennedy International Airport, and from Continental to provide daily Bogota-Newark service.<P>

   American will begin daily Dallas-to-Santiago, Chile, service in November, and daily New York-Rio de Janeiro service in June.<P>

   ``Generally, the policy is to expand the number of gateways,'' said a Transportation Department spokesman, Bill Mosley. ``The goal is to break down restrictions, create new opportunities and liberalize service across the map.''<P>

Similarity with JFK<BR>
   In a sense, what is happening with Latin America and Miami resembles what happened with with Europe and Kennedy International Airport in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<P>

   Historically, U.S. aviation gateways were established seaports, such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco and, for Latin American service, Miami.<P>

   But in the aftermath of airline deregulation in 1980, airlines began to build hubs throughout the United States. The industry and the regulators agreed that some of those hubs should have nonstop service to Europe, allowing passengers to bypass Kennedy, long this country's principal European gateway. They began awarding European routes to interior cities, such as Atlanta and Dallas.<P>

   The biggest casualty of the policy change was Pan Am, a historic international carrier focused on Kennedy. It failed to build a domestic system. JFK's importance also declined somewhat, though the airport was able to enlist foreign carriers to fill the gap left as domestic carriers declined.<BR>
Miami meltdown unlikely<P>

   Most experts don't expect a similar meltdown in Miami, largely because many Latin Americans actually want to come to Miami, while many Miamians travel to Latin America.<P>

   ``Nobody is going to bypass Miami,'' declared Peter Dolara, the senior vice president who oversees American's Latin operations. ``The commitment American has to Miami is unparalleled.''<P>

  Dolara conceded that American is adding a few flights to South America from Dallas, but explained: ``Continental is getting so big out of Houston that American has to have a reaction, as far as business that comes from the West Coast.''<P>

  Still, it is clear that Miami's share of the pie is unlikely to increase -- even if there are increases in service.<P>

   Just last week, airport director Gary Dellapa ordered a study to determine the impact of the increasing number of flights between Latin America and other airports.<P>

   ``Lots of places are getting flights to Central and South America, but does that erode Miami's market share?'' Dellapa asked. ``I don't know. Maybe it does in percentage terms, but not in terms of the absolute number of passengers, which has been increasing here by 8 percent to 10 percent annually.''<BR>
American could be key<P>

   Some say the real impact of increasing the number of gateways will be felt in the future, when American offers so much service to Miami that other airlines seeking niche business will locate elsewhere.<P>

   ``Right now, because we are in a period where airlines are profitable and expanding, you are seeing some route expansion at Miami,'' said Jim Laria, a veteran airport executive who is chief of cargo development at Orlando International Airport.<P>

   ``But at some point, American will reach a pinnacle there, stop its buildup and maybe even cut back a bit,'' Laria said. ``At that point, no one else will be able to grow there, because of American's dominance. The other airlines will all be going elsewhere.''<P>

   At the moment, the primary threat to Miami comes from Continental. The percentage of Continental revenues derived from Latin America has increased from 4 percent five years ago to 10 percent today.<P>

   About half of the airline's Latin revenues are generated by service to Mexico, which Continental's predecessor, Texas International, began serving from Houston 30 years ago. Today, Continental flies from Houston to 11 cities in Mexico, eight cities in Central America and three in South America. It also serves Lima from Newark.<P>

Recently, Continental has been recovering from years of poor labor relations, a reputation for shoddy service and an unsuccessful attempt to become a low-fare carrier. A key component of its growth strategy is additional service to Latin America -- which inevitably comes at Miami's expense.<P>

   ``Miami vs. Houston is something we've tried to play up,'' concedes Tom Anderson, Continental's vice president of marketing and sales.<P>

  ``The No. 1 destination for Latinos traveling to the U.S. is Miami, where many have bank accounts, insurance agents, friends and family,'' he said.<P>

   ``But since we don't have a hub in Miami, and we can't compete with American there, we feel as though we should try to develop our hubs in Houston and Newark and tell people that they can connect there as efficiently, or more efficiently, as they can in Miami.''<BR>
Houston touts advantages<P>

   Among Houston's advantages, he said, are its burgeoning Latin population -- the city is 25 percent Mexican American, with growing quantities of Central and South Americans -- and its many connections to the West Coast, Southwest and Midwest.<P>

   Continental is working feverishly to get more Latin traffic into its hubs. It is talking with carriers from Argentina, Brazil and Chile about moving their flights from Kennedy to Newark, in order to connect with Continental flights there. And it expects to one day fly from Newark and Houston to Cuba.<P>

   Houston's Intercontinental Airport is a big supporter of Continental's effort.<P>

   Central and South American traffic at Houston Intercontinental grew 6.7 percent in 1995 to about 670,000 passengers, up from 374,355 in 1990. ``Houston is now a proven gateway,'' said Hoyt Brown, deputy director of aviation. ``We just keep growing.''<P>

Cargo, too<BR>
   Houston is also in the forefront of the battle to move Latin American cargo shipments out of Miami. Continued growth, however, is expected to make Miami's airport, which handled 1.7 million tons of cargo last year, the world's largest cargo airport within two years.<P>

   In Houston, Latin American cargo carried in the bellies of passenger airplanes totaled about 5,000 tons in 1995, up from 2,200 tons in 1990. Several cargo carriers, including Miami-based Arrow, Challenge and Florida West, have expressed interest in Houston.<P>

   ``Miami has been a victim of its own success,'' said Luis Perez, Houston's chief of cargo marketing. ``They grew so fast and so much that people are looking for ways to get products through without congestion and mishaps.''<P>

   Houston looked on approvingly this spring when Dade County commissioners flirted with the idea of banning planes that use Miami International Airport from flying over Cuba, which requires that they pay a small fee to the Castro government.<P>

   ``If that were in place, Houston would look even more attractive,'' Perez said. ``If it happens to pass, Houston can use that. It would add costs for many of the carriers who use Miami.''<BR>
Flower war possible<P>

   Dave Rystrom, director of trade and development at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, points out that delivering flowers and other perishables to Texas instead of Miami knocks 60 to 72 hours off delivery times to the West and Midwest. After Rystrom presented his case at a flower wholesalers meeting in Dallas last year, ``They invited me to dinner to talk further,'' he said. Now he has a deal with Miami-based Tampa Airlines for twice-weekly, all-cargo flights to Bogota.<P>

   Dallas is also likely to increase its passenger business to Latin America, as American Airlines builds its Dallas hub.<P>

   Other Florida airports want more Latin service, too.<P>

   Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport thinks it can siphon off passengers headed for North Dade, Broward and Palm Beach.<P>

   In addition, Fort Lauderdale-based Carnival Airlines is working to set up a connecting complex in Fort Lauderdale, where its flights from the Northeast could connect with flights to Latin destinations.<BR>
Carnival adjusting schedules<P>

   Last month, Carnival offered a hint of its plans when it changed the departure of its daily Los Angeles-Fort Lauderdale flight to 11:30 p.m. so that the plane could connect with a Carnival flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and an Air Jamaica flight to Kingston and Montego Bay.<P>

   ``We all know that Broward is growing by leaps and bounds,'' said Carnival Chairman Reuven Wertheim. ``As time goes by, we expect to attract more international travelers to meet our flights in Fort Lauderdale.''<P>

   Orlando International Airport has argued for years that many Miami-bound passengers don't want to come here: They just rent a car and drive to Disney. Orlando officials say they are awaiting further loosening by the Transportation Department.<P>

   ``We would like to see the market open up,'' said Keith Phildius, the airport's director of marketing and international development. ``It's still a very restrictive environment.''<P>

   Orlando is patient, Phildius said. Only recently, Varig agreed to serve Orlando five times a week, with some nonstop flights and some service via Miami.<BR>
Fast-growing demand<P>

   Aviation consultant Bob Booth, who specializes in Latin America, said demand in the region is growing so fast that traffic will grow in both Miami and in competing cities.<P>

   ``No one is going to pull out of Miami -- it's too important,'' he said. ``But the growth continues to be staggering: You can expect the total market to more than double from 16 million passengers in 1990 to 36 million in 2000.<P>

   ``What this means is that in spite of Miami International's $3.5 million expansion program, the airport simply will not be able to handle all the demand,'' Booth said.
