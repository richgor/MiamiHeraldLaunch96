 Just as the dust was starting to settle, Jan Bell Marketing announced the resignation Monday of the president and chief executive brought in to take the Sunrise jeweler from wholesale to retail.<P>

  Joseph Pennacchio, 49, was two years into a five-year contract, and the company was in the midst of a turnaround. In releasing results in March, Jan Bell reported its first profitable quarter in nearly three years.<P>

  But there apparently were some simmering differences about the company's future and how to get more out of its major outlet, Sam's Club.<P>

  Through aggressive merchandising, Jan Bell wants to increase business at Sam's, where it has 437 leased jewelry departments that account for 91 percent of company sales.<P>

  ``It may largely be a personality conflict'' between Pennacchio and Isaac Arguetty, Jan Bell's chairman and co-founder, said Ed Tavlin, of Fahnestock & Co. in Hallandale. Tavlin said he didn't think the departure would affect the turnaround.<P>

  Noting that losses had decreased, Jan Bell spokeswoman Rosemary Trudeau also said the company needed ``to develop strategic plans to explore other opportunities.''<P>

  Trudeau called Pennacchio's exit an <BR>
<BR>

``amicable parting,'' and said ``the company hasn't quantified yet'' its financial arrangements with him. Pennacchio had a five-year contract with a base annual salary of $540,000 and a ``discretionary annual bonus of up to $216,000,'' according to the company's proxy statement.<P>

  Pennacchio, who was president of Jordan Marsh before joining Jan Bell in May 1994, said he would not comment.<P>

  Arguetty, 50, will be chief executive and hire a chief operating officer. In a prepared statement, he said Jan Bell was grateful to Pennacchio for ``helping the company through a difficult period.''<P>

  While losses dropped dramatically from $75 million in 1994 to $3.4 million for 1995, the stock price has been below $5. Shares, which once traded at almost $30, closed Monday at $3.12.<P>

  The resignation took analysts by surprise. Tavlin said he had no inkling of the departure.<P>

  ``I'm shocked,'' said Rick Berry, an analyst with Murphey, Marseilles, Smith in Atlanta. ``There's been a vast improvement since he arrived.''<P>

  Jan Bell has talked about being in five to 10 outlet malls by the end of the year and possibly going into another retail operation like Sam's, Berry said.<P>

  Part of Jan Bell's new strategy was the opening late last year of three of its own stores, one at an outlet mall in Vero Beach and two in Massachusetts.<P>

  Just before the Jewelry Depots opened, Pennacchio called the outlets ``a great way to do business'' and said Jan Bell was ``limited in how much we can promote at Sam's.''<P>

  Founded in 1983, Jan Bell enjoyed a decade of profits selling jewelry wholesale, but switched to retailing to control its inventory better and improve profits. The new retail setup and the devaluation of the Mexican peso contributed to the $75 million loss in 1994.<P>

  The two years of dramatic change included staff cuts and critical renegotiations of its debt.<P>

  Pennacchio's predecessor as president, Peter Hayes, lasted a year.
