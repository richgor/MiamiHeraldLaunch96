  Florida's tourism industry is starting a three-year fund-raising campaign to extract $20 million from its members for a new public/private partnership created to take on the state's tourism duties.<P>

  The partnership, created by newly passed legislation expected to be signed by Gov. Lawton Chiles, shifts the responsibilities of the state commerce department primarily to Enterprise Florida and the Florida Commission on Tourism.<P>

  One eagerly awaited outcome of this move would be a boost to the state's tourism advertising budget. A big chunk of the $20 million the partnership is seeking would be poured into advertising and marketing. Right now, spending by many other destinations far outstrips Florida's advertising efforts.<P>

  ``The private sector finally has what it wants -- control and no taxes,'' said Jack Painter, transition chief executive for the Florida Commission on Tourism. Now, it has a chance to run the tourism department like a business ``and pay their fair share,'' he said.<P>

  The tourism division has a $14.4 million budget, funded by part of the rental car fee the state collects. Half of the budget goes to advertising. The legislation gives the commission three years to reach the estimated $20 million annual goal, which the state will match.<P>

  Painter doesn't expect resistance. Not all the private commitment would be in direct cash. Some would come through cooperative advertising alliances.<P>

  The new setup is ``the first major breakthrough in creating a private business mentality for tourism marketing,'' he said. ``We're just not competitive for a state with as big a visitor industry as we have.''<P>

  Proposed guidelines call for payments of $500 per year for every $1 million in sales in Florida. Minimum contribution would be $100; maximum would be $400,000. But the formulas might be adjusted to fit the type of attraction.<P>

  ``We fully expect to be one of the largest, if not the largest'' contributors, Bill Warren, a spokesman for Walt Disney World Co. said Wednesday. He would not give precise figures but said Disney spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year to promote Walt Disney World resorts.<P>

  ``We have felt for some time there needs to be more advertising and promotion for the state as a destination as other destinations become more competitive,'' Warren said.<P>

  Acknowledging inherent regional rivalries, commission chairman Bill Sims said, ``We have to have parity in advertising.'' All regions have to be advertised, with promotions tailored to their targeted audiences.<P>

  ``We just can't advertise the state the way it's been advertised in the past,'' he said.<P>

  And Painter hopes to have an 800 number for the state's No. 1 industry.<P>

  The formal shift comes July 1 when the tourism division of the Department of Commerce starts operating as a not-for-profit corporation. Responsibility for the five visitors' centers would be shifted to the Department of Transportation.<P>

  The tourism commission will grow from 17 to 31 members, adding representatives from the rental car industry, tourism bureaus, airlines and cruise lines. Members also are divided by geographic regions, reflecting some concern over how much influence Orlando might have.<P>

  ``I think it will give us a much better opportunity to raise much-needed advertising funds to increase tourism to Florida,'' said Arthur Hertz, chairman of Wometco Enterprises, which owns the Miami Seaquarium, and a tourism commission member.<P>

  He also said the commission would try to convince the restaurant industry ``that it's in their best interest'' to participate in the program.<P>

  ``We're going to have an opportunity to do something very good,'' said Nicki Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention & Visitors Bureau.<P>

  She said she hoped Florida would keep its commitment to funding the industry, ``and I hope the state recognizes the long-term objectives.''
