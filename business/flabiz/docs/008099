   Cuban exile banker Orlando Castro Llanes, facing larceny charges in Manhattan, has dropped his fight against extradition to New York and intends to seek bail in a state court there next week, his attorney said Friday.<ep>
   Castro, his son Orlando Jr., and his grandson, Jorge, have been locked up in the Dade County Jail since their arrests April 3. Last week, Dade Circuit Judge Alex Ferrer approved their extradition. Castro attorney, Richard Sharpstein vowed to appeal.<ep>
   But the Miami lawyer abandoned the strategy after it became apparent that the Castros' chances of obtaining bail in Florida were next to nil. At a hearing last week, prosecutors argued that bail could not be granted because the governors of both states filed court papers to move the Castros to New York.<ep>
   Judge Ferrer agreed. He also concurred with their legal analysis that the appropriate place to mount challenges against charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau would be in New York, not Florida.<ep>
   Once the overseer of a 13,000-employee business empire that encompassed banks, insurance companies and radio stations in Venezuela, Castro fled to Miami after the government seized his holdings and accused him of fraud and embezzlement.<ep>
   Although Venezuela has not sought the Castros' extradition, it did help Morgenthau investigate the flow of money from a Castro-held bank in Puerto Rico through banks in New York. That money in turn flowed to Castro's Banco Progreso in Caracas in the early 1990s.<ep>
   Morgenthau charged that $55 million was stolen from the depositors in Puetro Rico. Sharpstein argues that no crime was committed, and that Manhattan had no authority bring any charges.<ep>
   He said the Castros are likely to be flown to New York next Wednesday for a court appearance the next day.<ep>
