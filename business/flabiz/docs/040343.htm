  Certified Vacations said chief executive Michael F. Stone has quit, and the Fort Lauderdale-based tour operator will be run by an Alamo Rent-A-Car executive until a replacement is found. Alamo Chairman Mike Egan owns the large travel company.<P>

   After four years as president, Stone, 46, is leaving ``to pursue several new opportunities,'' according to a statement from Egan. Alamo's vice chairman and chief operating officer Roger Ballou, a travel industry veteran, will temporarily manage the company.<P>

<H2>Royce settles with SEC over disclosures</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

  Royce Laboratories and its chairman reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with an investigation into possible violations of federal securities laws.<P>

   Royce Labs is a Miami-based maker of generic drugs. The SEC investigation focused on disclosures made by the company between July 1991 and April 1992 regarding the status of its abbreviated new drug applications for Piroxicam and Minoxidil. The probe also concerned sales of Royce Labs' securities.<P>

   Chairman Patrick J. McEnany agreed to pay a $25,000 administrative fine to defray some of the SEC's expenses for the investigation. McEnany and Royce also agreed to a civil injunction requiring them to comply with federal securities laws in the future, though they neither admitted nor denied a violation had occurred.
