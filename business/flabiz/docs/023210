<m0> Miami ranks as the fifth least affordable place for executives to live, among 75 U.S. housing markets, an E&Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group report released Wednesday shows.<ep>
  Only San Francisco, Los Angeles, Honolulu and the Oakland/East Bay area are less affordable, according to the 1996 Study of Housing Costs. Fort Lauderdale also ranks near the bottom, at 57th out of 75.<ep>
  The report compares the cost of owning a four-bedroom home or renting a two-bedroom luxury apartment (--) with amenities such as a pool and patio or access to recreational facilities like a golf course (--) in relation to the local median household income.<ep>
  It's geared to show how attractive a city is for companies considering moving corporate headquarters there, said Jim Miller, managing partner for E&Y Kenneth Leventhal's Miami Real Estate Group.<ep>
  Metropolitan Miami's ranking dropped to 71 this year from 63 last year. In 1996, an average household in Dade has to spend 35.5 percent of its income for housing. A Fort Lauderdale household must shell out 28.5 percent.<ep>
  By contrast, in Oklahoma City, which ranked most affordable, housing costs take up just 19.5 percent of household income.<ep>
  Other Florida cities ranked include Orlando, 43rd; West Palm Beach, 54th; Sara<m2><ql>

  The costs reflect the impact of federal and state tax deductions as well as local property taxes, but do not include insurance expenses. All figures were based on fourth-quarter 1995 housing and rental prices.<ep>
  Miller said Miami's low affordability is largely due to rising housing costs, reflecting stepped up demand in the $300,000 to $500,000 market.<ep>
  ``There is a huge demand for that product that is pushing the price of housing up,'' Miller said. ``If you look at Miami Beach and the luxury condominium market there, it's just exploding.''<ep>
  Miller said estimates show that another 7,000 condominium units will be built in Miami Beach by the year 2000. ``And there's a very large incidence of presales, which tends to push the price up,'' he said.<ep>
  At the same time, Dade County's median income has stagnated since 1980, when adjusted for inflation, said Chuck Blowers, chief of research in Dade's Planning, Development and Regulation Department. Based on U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development figures, Blowers estimates 1996 Dade County median household income at $33,125.<ep>
  Miami's median income may be low relative to other cities, Miller said, while housing costs here are higher. A four-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath, 2,200-square-foot single-family home costs $97,125 in Oklahoma City, compared with $169,500 in Miami, according to a Coldwell Banker home price comparison index, said Vice President Charlette Seidel.<ep>
  Miami's unusual real estate market, with its large number of foreign buyers, may also put it at a disadvantage in the rankings.<ep>
  ``If you just took the median household income in Dade County and used that to measure the capability of affording these luxury units, you're going to have a problem,'' Blowers said, ``because a lot of these luxury condominiums are not being paid for by residents.''<ql>
