<m0>fter Arthur Shonbrun threw a seaborne bash for 20 family members in January, the retired garment manufacturer says he returned home to Pompano Beach and an unpleasant surprise: An invoice for his three-day cruise that showed $2,000 in ``port charges.''<ep>
  ``They ran the trip beautifully,'' said Shonbrun, who took a Majesty Cruise Line sojourn from Miami to Nassau to Key West and back. ``They were just taking advantage on that port charge. I thought it was out of line. But when I called them, they told me there was nothing I could about it.''<ep>
  Lawyers hoping to fold unhappy passengers like Shonbrun into class action lawsuits say they intend to do something about it. The suits, filed in Florida, California and Washington state, claim that a number of cruise lines pad their port charges and therefore their bank accounts. Lawyers haven't determined what damages they'll seek.<ep>
  The parade to the courthouse stepped off in the wake of an investigation started last <m2><ql>

PORT CHARGES,  FROM  1F<ql>
<m0>year by Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth's office.<ep>
  Good luck. The lawyers may end up deciding that the earth is flat before they can make sense of the dizzying array of fees that cruise lines pay to port authorities and a host of other agencies (--) fees that are passed on to passengers as a neatly bundled postscript in fancy travel brochures.<ep>
  In fact, as cruisers imbibe, swim, sunbathe, gamble or eat themselves silly aboard the world's most luxurious floating play palaces, fee meters spin at full tilt as their giant ships, some carrying up to 2,500 people, manuveur in and out of home ports and ports of call.<ep>
  In the United States, agencies such as the INS, IRS, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs, Centers for Disease Control and state and federal agricultural agencies all queue up to collect their shares for various inspections.<ep>
  At home and abroad, the hands of fee collectors are permanently extended to pay for the tugboat operators, line handlers, permit grantors and duty assessors who both greet and bid the ships adieu.<ep>
  How is it all allocated?<ep>
  ``We try to come up with an average because it would be a nightmare trying to allocate to every person,'' said Tim Gallagher, spokesman for Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines, the world's largest.<ep>
  ``That's why if you look at our seven-day cruises from Miami to different ports (--) we're charging the same,'' he said. ``We try to cover the lion's share. In reality, there is so much you can charge.''<ep>
  Gallagher said the charges are disclosed to customers in advance.<ep>
  ``The pricing tables contain fees in the same size type and print as everything else,'' he said.<ep>
  Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, a Miami-based competitor, appears to follow a similar practice of producing an average port charge for each passenger. On many of its seven-day trip in the Caribbean, the charge per passenger is $105.<ep>
  Spokesman Rich Steck declined to discuss the issue, citing the lawsuits. Like Carnival, RCCL is a defendant in the latest round of suits brought by the New York law firm of Zwerling, Schachter, Zwerling & Koppell. The others are Celebrity Cruises, Kloster Cruise Ltd.'s Norwegian Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and Renaissance Cruises.<ep>
  At Majesty, which operates out of Miami under the same roof as Dolphin Cruise Lines, management takes stock of the fees and charges on any given trip, and spreads them evenly among the passengers on board.<ep>
  ``We look at the total charges we have and divide them by 90 percent of the occupancy of ship,'' said Niki Vlastara, vice president of marketing. ``Usually, the average occupancy is between 90 and 95 percent.''<ep>
  Vlastara said the fees were made known to the Shonbruns before they embarked upon their cruise.<ep>
  Shonbrun said he recalls that ``gross charges were listed.<ep>
  ``But I didn't know there were individual charges for port taxes,'' he insisted. ``I only found that out after I called my wife's daughter in Providence, R.I.,'' who booked the trip.<ep>
  While Shonbrun felt blindsided, he also felt grossly overcharged.<ep>
  New York attorney Joseph Lipofsky, whose firm is pressing the recently announced litigation, claims that clients involved in the lawsuits feel the same way.<ep>
  ``They are using this as a revenue source, and not as a pass-through by government authorities,'' he said of the cruise companies.<ep>
  ``The cruise lines are charged `X' by the authorities, who pass it on to the passengers,'' Lipofsky said. ``But the cruise lines use it to increase the price of the cruise (--) to cover other overhead they choose to include.''<ep>
  Industry people disagree.<ep>
  ``Passengers are charged port charges and government fees related to the costs of visiting certain ports,'' said Mercedes McDonnell, spokeswoman for the International Council of Cruise Lines in Washington, D.C. ``This practice has been going on for many years.''<ep>
  Padding or not, one thing is certain. The charges are going up every year, <m1> <m0>said Carnival's Gallagher.<ep>
  And new ones are coming aboard with increasing regularity.<ep>
  A recent arrival: A $6.50-a-head passenger fee in countries that signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (--) enough to discourage one last stiff drink.<ql>
