<m0> A surge in European and Canadian visitors this year pushed Dade tourism up 7.5 percent for a record first quarter, according to statistics released Thursday by the Greater Miami Convention & Visitors Bureau.<ep>
  The 2.7 million tourists (--) 58 percent domestic and 42 percent international (--) continued the fast pace that brought a record 9.4 million visitors to Dade in 1995.<ep>
  And those who came were in the mood to spend.<ep>
  Average daily expenditures per visitor grew 41 percent to $186.82. Total visitor spending was $3 billion, a 49 percent increase over the first quarter of 1995.<ep>
  Tourism officials say the numbers show a marked increase in consumer confidence reflected in several key areas, among them rental cars and shopping. More people rented cars (--) 1.8 million this year compared with 1.6 million last year.<ep>
  All this means tourists have ``a higher and safer comfort level,'' so they're visiting more places and spending more money throughout the community, said Merrett Stierheim, bureau president and chief executive.<ep>
  Tourist trade at major malls was up dramatically, and Lincoln Road mall in Miami Beach was recognized for the first time as a shopping destination, officials said.<ep>
  Preliminary surveys point to a healthy second quarter, officials say, with modest growth from key international markets such as Europe and South America. Even the U.S. market, which traditionally starts to slow in the second quarter, is expected to grow a bit.<ep>
  Overall, domestic visitors for the first quarter grew 10.3 percent over 1995. With 677,000 visitors, the Northeast accounted for 48.1 percent of the market. But visitors from the South increased by nearly 70 percent to 374,000.<ep>
  While overall international tourism was up 4.7 percent, the number of European visitors rose 36.7 percent. The 420,000 overnight visitors (--) primarily <m2><ql>

  Nearly 202,000 Canadians (--) a 33.9 percent boost (--) surpassed 1993 highs, due in part to expanded flights, a more stable Canadian dollar and easing of health insurance concerns.<ep>
  Tourism from South America, Dade's top market in the region, grew 5.4 percent to 392,000 visitors. Tourism from Central America grew 29 percent to more than 89,000 visitors, though traffic from Mexico dropped 16.6 percent because of that country's economic difficulties.<ep>
  Economic problems from an active hurricane season accounted for a 48.5 percent drop in Caribbean visitors.<ep>
