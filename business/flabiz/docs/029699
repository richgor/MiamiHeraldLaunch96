<m0>  Winn-Dixie, in a move to grab market share in the competitive Dade grocery arena, said Monday it will buy two of the Miami Xtra Super Food Center stores that closed this year.<ep>
   Within six weeks, Winn-Dixie stores will open at the former Xtra sites in the Coral Way Shopping Center, 3275 SW 22nd St., and the Bird Road Shopping Center, 11241 SW 40th St.<ep>
   ``They fill some voids for us,'' said Mickey Clerc, a Winn-Dixie spokesman. ``And they were stores similar to the stores that we open today.''<ep>
   Clerc wouldn't disclose the purchase price. Xtra executives in Pompano Beach didn't return phone calls seeking comment.<ep>
   The former Xtra supermarkets average more than 62,000 square feet, a size close to Winn-Dixie's new, larger Marketplace stores, which average 48,000 square feet. Winn-Dixie will remodel the stores to reflect its identity, Clerc said. Each store will employ 150 to 200 employees, and former Xtra employees will be considered for jobs.<ep>

<m0>which are in Broward County. The stores in the Winn-Dixie deal were among Xtra's eight South Florida supermarkets, which parent company Pueblo Xtra International began closing in March, exiting the South Florida market.<ep>
   Winn-Dixie isn't pursuing the other locations, taking only two choice sites that didn't surprise observers. Both stores will help the Jacksonville chain increase market share significantly, which is crucial in the competitive supermarket business.<ep>
   ``Of the locations that were available, those were two of the better ones,'' said Joe Corral, a senior associate with CB Commercial Real Estate Group in Miami. ``Coral Way is an excellent area; it has a lot of density, but it's very hard to assemble enough land at an affordable price. Winn-Dixie was in dire need of a location in that area.<ep>
   ``And Bird Road, although not to the extent of Coral Way, it's still an area with a lot of density and on a very high-traffic artery,'' Corral said.<ql>
