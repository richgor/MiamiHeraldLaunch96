<m0>  Peoples Telephone Co. said its net loss increased by about $1.2 million while its revenues declined by 15.4 percent in the quarter ended March 31.<ep>
   The Miami-based company, an operator of pay telephones, said its results were affected by a switch to AT&T as its national operator service provider and a decrease in its installed base of prison-inmate telephone lines.<ep>
   E. Craig Sanders, newly appointed chief executive, said he intends to focus on improving service, ``internal growth, alignment of accountability, and pushing decision making out closer to the customer.''<ql>

<m0>   TresCom International of Fort Lauderdale reported a 55 percent increase in first-quarter revenue Wednesday and said it cut its losses for the period by more than half.<ep>
   TresCom, a provider of international long-distance telephone service, had lost $7.6 million in the first quarter of 1995 and cut it to $3.4 million. Company President Wesley O'Brien said the increases in revenue and service usage illustrate the pent-up demand for alternative long-distance carriers abroad.<ep>
