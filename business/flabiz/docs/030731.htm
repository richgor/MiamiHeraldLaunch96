<H2>Sushi craze helps lift Benihana profits 60%</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

  Benihana keeps cashing in on the sushi craze. The Miami company that has added sushi bars at 20 of the 46 Japanese restaurants it owns or licenses, recorded a 60 percent increase in profits for the year ended March 31.<P>

   Benihana's annual revenues also increased 11 percent. Same store sales for the year -- and the guest count -- were up about 8 percent.<P>

   Benihana President Joel Schwartz attributed the profitable year to the popularity of the sushi bars, seven of which were added last year, and the upgrading of existing restaurants, which cost $3 million.<P>

   Last year, the company also introduced its first Benihana Grill in Sacramento, Calif., ``an intimate version of our traditional restaurant allowing penetration of markets that were not feasible for free-standing Benihana restaurants,'' Schwartz said in a statement.<P>

   Two more Benihana Grills are planned for the current year.<BR>

Catalina Lighting<BR>

  Despite a dip in sales, earnings increased 67 percent at Catalina Lighting, a Miami-based manufacturer and distributor of lighting products. Lower inventory levels, leading to lower interest expenses, led to the higher gross profits, the company said.<BR>

ADT Ltd.<BR>
<P>

  The adoption of an accounting rule pertaining to long-lived assets led to a $379.1 million first-quarter loss at ADT Ltd. of Boca Raton.<P>

   The writedown of certain assets to their estimated fair values resulted in a $410.1 million non-cash charge against earnings during the three months ended March 31. Had it not been for the accounting rule, ADT would have posted a profit of $31 million, or 14 percent higher than the same quarter last year. First-quarter sales were 5 percent lower than a year ago, but only because ADT sold two European business units that accounted for $54.5 million in the first quarter of 1995.<P>

   ADT is the largest supplier of electronic security services in North America and the second-largest provider of vehicle auction services in the United States.<BR>

Hamilton Bank<BR>
<P>

  Miami-based Hamilton Bank reported record earnings for the first quarter of 1996, ended March 31. Net income at the privately held bank reached $2.53 million, an increase of 12 percent compared to the same three-month period of 1995.<P>

   Chairman and Chief Executive Eduardo A. Masferrer attributed higher earnings to continued growth in trade financing activities.<P>

   Hamilton Bank has five Florida branches and regional advisory offices in Europe and Latin America.
