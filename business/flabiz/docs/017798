<m0>  In an effort to restore profitability, financially troubled Physician Corp. of America said Monday that it has sold its 40 medical clinics in Florida and its underperforming HMOs in Georgia and Alabama.<ep>
   And Miami-based PCA said its losses narrowed in the first quarter, while revenues and HMO enrollment climbed.<ep>
   The state's largest provider of health services to poor and disabled people receiving Medicaid, PCA has suffered since last year from higher-than-expected medical expenses and significant cutbacks in Medicaid reimbursement rates.<ep>
   Looking for a remedy, PCA signed up investment bank Bear Stearns & Co. last fall to explore financial options and assist with the sale of its out-of-state HMOs.<ep>
   On Monday, PCA's shares closed unchanged at $14.87 1/2, near its 52-week low of $13.50.<ep>
   The company called its quarterly loss of $4.9 million ``a significant improvement'' over the fourth quarter of 1995, when PCA lost $36.5 million. In the first quarter, PCA's Florida HMOs reported losses of $16.1 million, versus a $22.9 million loss in the fourth quarter of last year.<ep>
   The results mean PCA's efforts during the past several months to boost profitability are begining to show results, PCA executives said.<ep>
   ``The Florida turnaround is progressing and is expected to be completed in 1996,'' said Stanley Kardatzke, PCA's chairman and chief executive.<ep>
   While first-quarter losses exceeded his projections, ``The bad news out of the earnings isn't the whole story,'' said Robert Mains, health care analyst with First Albany. ``There are some other things going on behind the scenes that I think are positive.''<ep>
   Among them:<ep>
   (box) PCA sold its 125-physician network and 40 affiliated clinics for $23 million to FPA Medical Management, a physician practice management company based in San Francisco. The clinics, which treated only PCA patients, <m1><styl>cxon<ql>

<m0>weren't busy enough, PCA executives said. But under a 10-year deal expected to close in June, PCA will pay FPA Medical 80 percent of premiums collected to care for its HMO members. The clinics care for about 23 percent of PCA's 82,000 Florida members. About half of them are recipients of Medicaid.<ep>
   (box) The company sold its underperforming HMOs in Georgia and Alabama to Health Partners of Alabama for $25 million in a deal expected to close in July. While the HMOs accounted for only 4 percent of first-quarter revenues, they lost $2.5 million during that period, the company said. PCA will continue its ``strategy of being a dominant HMO player in our core markets of Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico,'' Kardatzke said. Proceeds from both transactions will be used to pay down PCA's $160 million debt.<ep>
   (box) Another indicator of HMO strength also improved. PCA's medical loss ratio (--) the percentage of premiums spent on medical care (--) dipped to 87 percent, down from 90 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. PCA said it is also spending less on administration.<ep>
   (box) PCA may also be getting legislative relief. Last week, the Florida Legislature passed a measure requiring all the state's 1.6 million Medicaid recipients be enrolled in a managed care plan to cut costs. Gov. Lawton Chiles must give final approval. Medicaid pays doctor and hospital bills for Florida's poor and disabled and is jointly funded by the state and federal governments. PCA had been left reeling after the state cut reimbursements to all Medicaid HMOs. The state concurrently slapped Medicaid HMO plans with marketing restrictions to curb enrollment fraud, a move the HMOs said made it more difficult to find new members and fueled enrollment declines.<ep>
   (box) Membership in PCA's health plans rose to 918,000, compared with 646,000 the previous year. PCA also operates commercial, Medicare and workers compensation health plans.<ql>
