   Peppered with criticism for spurning buyout overtures from Hercules Inc., W.R. Grace Chairman Albert Costello told shareholders at the company's annual meeting <m1> <m0>Friday that Grace's board hasn't ruled out the possibility of merging with a company with ``product synergies.''<ep>
   Several shareholders in the audience of 500 expressed disappointment that Grace didn't pursue a pitch from Hercules Chairman Thomas Gossage that Hercules acquire Grace. Gossage's proposal cost him his position as a Grace director in March. He has since reiterated that Hercules and Grace would make a good fit, while engaging in confidential talks with two other companies.<ep>
   Costello, who joined Boca Raton-based Grace one year ago amid a front-office sex scandal and shareholder unrest, was rankled by the suggestion that he was negligent in representing shareholder interests.<ep>
   ``We've had no discussions with him, and he's made no proposal,'' Costello said of Gossage. ``If Gossage makes an offer in the press, that's a hostile bid. I see no need to talk with Gossage about a merger with his company when we have no product synergies at all.''<ep>
   Takeover speculation helped drive up the price of Grace shares to $83 in April. The stock has since cooled off, closing at $74.75 Friday, up 25 cents a share.<ep>
   Nonetheless, investors and analysts still suspect Costello has an ace up his sleeve. ``One can theorize that ever since Gossage made a pass at him, Costello could be looking at other companies as a white knight,'' said Bear Stearns analyst Jeff Cianci.<ep>
   Costello wouldn't say if he's talking with other companies. He emphasized that his main concern is leading Grace into high-growth businesses with good profit margins. He said the sale of three business units, including National Medical Care, will raise $3 billion to reduce debt, buy back stock and make capital investments.<ep>
   ``If I can create value by staying in a <m4>Costello<m2><ql>
<m0>business, I'll do that. If I can't, I'll sell it,'' Costello told reporters after the meeting. ``I may be old, but I'm not old-fashioned and I never wanted to be a manager who was entrenched. If I can't make my contribution in four years, I'm not going to make it.''<ep>
   National Medical Care, whose $2.1 billion in sales accounted for 36 percent of Grace's revenue last year, is being spun off to a new company controlled by Fresenius AG, a German maker of kidney dialysis equipment. Grace shareholders will own 45 percent of the new company and will receive their shares in the form of a tax-free dividend.<ep>
