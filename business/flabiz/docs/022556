<m0> Knight-Ridder said Tuesday it has sold its financial news unit for $275 million to Global Financial Information Corp., a St. Louis company that provides information and trading services to institutional investors.<ep>
  The sale of Knight-Ridder Financial had been expected. The company had hired Goldman, Sachs & Co. to find a buyer for the division in January.<ep>
  But investors reacted negatively to the news. Knight-Ridder shares fell $1.87 Tuesday, to close at $70.37. Some analysts had expected the sale price to range from $300 million to $400 million.<ep>
  But other analysts suggested the $275 million price tag was realistic, and the stock market simply had corrected inflated expectations.<ep>
  ``Basically, the market said a while ago that it was impressed with Knight-Ridder's renewed focus on profitability,'' said Peter Appert, an analyst for Alex Brown & Sons in San Francisco.<ep>
  Knight-Ridder has aggressively cut costs across much of the company to boost its stock price, which has jumped more than 15 percent since January.<ep>
  The Miami-based company, which publishes 31 newspapers including The Herald, said it decided to sell the financial news unit rather than make the investment needed to raise its operating profit to an acceptable level.<ep>
  The deal had advantages for both companies. Knight-Ridder was able to shed an underperforming unit, Appert said, while selling it to a company that could make better use of its assets.<ep>
  ``It was a deal that both sides can walk away from with their heads held high,'' said Jim Doughtery, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds. ``I thought that it was quite fairly priced.''<ep>
  Calling the sale a good strategic move, Doughtery said Knight-Ridder Financial was too small to compete effectively against much larger industry players.<ep>
  ``As a part of Knight-Ridder, it was a business that would not have been important,'' he said.<ep>

  Global Financial Information Corp., owned by the venture-capital firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, provides real-time and historical data on more than 300,000 stocks, options, commodities, futures, indexes and currencies.<ep>
  ``GFI will be an excellent new home for Knight-Ridder Financial,'' said Polk Laffoon, Knight-Ridder vice president for corporate relations. ``Their different expertises dovetail very well.''<ep>
  Knight-Ridder said it plans to use the proceeds mainly to reduce debt and repurchase stock. Subject to regulatory approval, the sale is expected to be completed in the third quarter.<ql>
