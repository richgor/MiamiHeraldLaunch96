  The state is stepping up its campaign against bad builders -- unlicensed contractors who either take the money and run, or stay and do shoddy work.<P>

   On Thursday, the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (BPR) and the Building Officials Association of Florida began hosting a series of workshops for building inspectors, the people often on the front line of fighting unlicensed construction.<P>

   The seminars are being held in nine cities across the state, including Miami Beach and Boca Raton.<P>

   ``Unlicensed construction is a huge problem in Florida,'' said Chuck Lennon, executive vice president of the South Florida Builders Association. ``These unlicensed contractors offer dirt-cheap prices, and the homeowners go for it.''<P>

   Last year, there were 1,400 complaints filed against unlicensed actions in the 36 professions regulated by BPR. Of that number, 790 of the complaints were in construction.<P>

   Faced with numbers like that, BPR Secretary Richard Farrell announced a new attack last summer. It included a $154,000 public awareness campaign called ``Don't Get Nailed,'' which included brochures as well as television and radio ads. BPR and local state attorneys' offices also set up residential and commercial stings to catch unlicensed contractors. South Florida, a hot spot for unlicensed activity, is now a priority for BPR undercover operations.<P>

   Now, officials are offering workshops for building inspectors, a primer on bad builders, how to spot them and how to quickly verify license numbers.<P>

   Typically, an unlicensed contractor asks the homeowner to obtain a building permit to avoid contact with county officials. By law, only a homeowner or licensed contractor can pull a building permit.<P>

   ``The last place an unlicensed contractor wants to show his pretty little face is at the building department, where he can get caught,'' BPR spokesman Ed Towey said.<P>

   So building officials will remind homeowners of the laws. For those brazen unlicensed contractors who show up with a fake license number, building officials will be able to quickly verify it through new automated and on-line systems. The datebase includes 117,000 state certified or registered contractors.<P>

   ``This will serve as a drill,'' Towey said. ``We will be giving the modus operandi of these guys and tips on how to catch them. They are doing plenty of harm.''<P>

   Indeed. After Hurricane Andrew blasted South Florida, unlicensed contractors came out in droves. Consumers were bilked out of at least $200 million, BPR records show.<P>

   Unlicensed construction is a second-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 60 days in prison and a $500 fine. In a designated disaster area, it is considered a felony. Violators face up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.<P>

   Despite the penalties and publicity, unlicensed contractors continue to drum up business among consumers. The incentive: lower prices. Without having to carry workers' compensation or liability insurance, they can easily outbid legitimate builders.<P>

   ``Let's suppose you have work that needs to be done, and you get bids of about $10,000. Then along comes the neighbor of the brother-in-law of the guy at the pool hall who will do the work for $3,000,'' Towey said. ``What are you going to do? Too many take the chance to save the money.''
