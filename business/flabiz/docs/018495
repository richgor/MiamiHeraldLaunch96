<m0>n the button-down, Brooks Brothers world of banking, sporting a beard and wearing cowboy boots with your suit can mark you as a maverick (--) not exactly a welcome distinction.<ep>
   But it hasn't hurt Jefferson Bank's president, Barton S. Goldberg. With decades of top-level banking experience and a solid reputation for community involvement, he has been chosen by his peers around the state to lead the pack.<ep>
   Beginning June 7, Goldberg will serve for a year as president of the Florida Bankers Association, the 275-member trade association for banks and thrifts.<ep>
   It's the first time since 1982 that a banker from South Florida has served as president, and the first time ever that the president hails from a Miami Beach bank.<ep>
   The group's president serves as a spokesman and consensus-builder, representing the organization on legislative issues, said John Milstead, its Tallahassee-based executive vice president.<ep>
   Goldberg's fellow bankers say he brings experience and leadership to the role, as well as an extra degree of expertise because he is a lawyer.<ep>
   ``Much of what the Florida Bankers Association does is to try to make sure laws that are passed don't harm our customers or institutions, and in that regard being a lawyer is definitely a plus,'' said Byron Hodnett. Based in Jacksonville, he's chief executive of First Union National Bank of Florida and the association's outgoing president.<ep>
   Goldberg, 62, has been active in the group for decades. He has served on various committees and organized the annual meeting three years ago. <ep>
   Goldberg (--) whose Oriental rug-lined office is filled with antiques, paintings and miniature elephants (--) says he wants to sharpen the industry's image. He doesn't want to shake up the organization, but ``polish it.''<ep>
   ``My rallying cry is that banks are depicted as villains,'' he said, referring to criticism over banking fees. ``I don't think our image is as good out there as it should be.''<ep>
   Among the legislative goals for Goldberg and the association are parity for state-chartered banks with nationally chartered banks that sell insurance, and having credit unions pay taxes just as banks do. The latter is something the association has pursued for years.<ep>
   Goldberg also wants to stress bankers' leadership in their communities. The theme of his presidency, he said, will be ``involved, concerned and committed.''<ep>
   ``Show me any community that is failing, and I'll show you bankers who aren't doing their job,'' Goldberg said. <m1><ep>
<m0>   He admits that the involvement is not fueled by altruism alone. ``Whatever is good for the communities where Jefferson is located has to be good for Jefferson,'' he said.<ep>
   Particularly for smaller ``community'' banks (--) those with less than $1 billion in assets (--) civic and charitable activities are the key to success, Goldberg said.<ep>
   ``People don't come to the bank because you put ads in the paper,'' he said. ``People come because they know someone that banks with you or because you're involved in your community, or their church or synagogue.''<ep>
   Goldberg also hopes to shine the association's spotlight on South Florida. <m1> <m0>He plans to offer more seminars here and hold next year's big meeting at the Fontainebleau Hilton Resort & Towers.<ep>
   A Miami Beach resident since 1942, Goldberg stumbled into banking somewhat unexpectedly. He practiced law for several years, beginning in 1958.<ep>
   In 1963, when he joined Courshon & Courshon, a Miami Beach law firm, Goldberg was given the task of putting Jefferson together for investors. He dealt with the regulators, handled the financing and oversaw the construction of Jefferson's Miami Beach headquarters, which opened in 1964 with $4.5 million in deposits and a staff of 14.<ep>
   For the next five years, Goldberg was the bank's attorney, becoming executive vice president in 1967. In 1969, President Thomas Mottola died suddenly. Goldberg took over the following year.<ep>
   Jefferson, he said, is the only Miami Beach bank that has survived three decades of consolidation. Several other banks that once had headquarters there, including Bank of Miami Beach and Miami Beach First National Bank, have since been acquired by larger banks.<ep>
   Still on Arthur Godfrey Road, Jefferson has nine branches: two in Miami Beach, including the headquarters, two in Sunny Isles, one in Aventura, one in Key Biscayne, one in Hollywood, one in Fort Lauderdale and one in Boca Raton. Jefferson employs 220 and had $420 million in assets on March 31.<ep>
   The bank's stock is publicly traded; it has about 450 stockholders. But a handful of people control the bank, including Chairman Arthur Courshon and his family.<ep>
   Over the years, Goldberg has amassed 200,000 shares, or about a 7 percent interest.<ep>
   Though consolidation is the watchword of the industry, Goldberg won't say an acquisition is inevitable. He admits it's a possibility, though. And as a large shareholder, he said, he has ``mixed emotions.''<ep>
   Even if the bank is acquired, Goldberg wouldn't want to retire.<ep>
   ``I love banking,'' he said. ``I left the practice of law to be a banker. I love it because of what it helps accomplish. We've helped businesses start that have grown into the biggest businesses in the community.''<ep>
   Take Miami-based Carnival Hotels & Resorts (formerly The Continental Cos.), a well-known player in the hospitality industry.<ep>
   ``In the early '70s, when we had just formed the company and were starting to put deals together, we were at a point where nobody knew us or had any interest whatsoever in doing business with us,'' said Donald Lefton, vice chairman. He and partner Sherwood Weiser had been lawyers in Cleveland before moving to Miami to own and operate hotels.<ep>
   ``We needed capital to do a market study and pay architects, and nobody was willing to speak to us or give us any assistance whatsoever, with the exception of one place (--) and that was Jefferson,'' Lefton said.<ep>
  ``While I don't think we got everything we wanted, Goldberg was always cooperative and reasonable, and we enjoyed what I consider an ideal relationship between banker and customer,'' Lefton said.<ep>
     Pretty high praise for a guy in cowboy boots (--) which he wears mostly when he shows his Arabian horse.<ql>
