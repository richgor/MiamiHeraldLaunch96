   Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson is unlikely to approve a Joint Underwriting Association request to markedly raise consumers' deductibles on theft coverage, his spokesman said Friday.<P>

   The JUA board had voted to prepare a request to hike theft deductibles to $2,500, from their current $500, at a meeting in Orlando Thursday.<P>

   ``Bill's first reaction was that it sounded kind of ridiculous -- it sounds like it's way too drastic,'' said Nelson spokesman Don Pride. ``I don't see Bill Nelson approving that kind of an increase.''<P>

   The JUA had not yet discussed the deductible issue with Nelson, Pride added. <P>

   ``Whatever they propose would have to be fully justified,'' Pride said. ``He's just not going to approve anything that would be a real jolt to the consumer.''<P>

   Created as an insurer of last resort for those unable to get property insurance in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, the JUA has mushroomed to become the state's second-largest insurer with more than 890,000 policies. Nearly half of the policyholders live in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.<P>

   Theft has taken its toll on the JUA. Since 1993, 17 percent of all losses incurred by the JUA have been related to theft claims. In total, the JUA has paid out $60 million for theft claims, its third highest claim category, after fire and water seepage, JUA Chairman Bill Wilson said. He added that the JUA's experience is in line with the industry average.<P>

   ``There is a serious problem that the JUA has with theft losses and I think it's a problem the JUA board felt had to be dealt with one way or another,'' said Sam Miller, spokesman for the Florida Insurance Council, who attended the board meeting. <P>

    Seven of nine voting JUA board members approved the request for the higher deductible, said Wilson, who did not vote. Two members -- Department of Insurance Consumer Advocate Steve Burgess and mobile home industry representative George Moyer -- voted against the higher deductible because there was no corresponding reduction in premium.<P>

   With theft claims averaging $2,135, raising the deductible to $2,500 would eliminate most claims and save the JUA about $20 million a year, Wilson said.<P>

   ``They do have a problem with the cost of theft claims,'' said the Insurance Department's Pride. ``And you have to look at the problem and take reasonable action. But it's just unfair to expect consumers to cover that much of the bill when something is stolen from their homes.''
