  Single-family, existing-home sales rose 11 percent statewide during the first quarter of 1996 compared with the same period last year, the Florida Association of Realtors reported Thursday.<P>

   Sales in both Miami and Fort Lauderdale increased 10 percent in the first quarter of 1996.<P>

   The group attributed higher sales to lower interest rates. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 7.34 percent from an average of 8.79 percent during the first quarter of last year, the association said.

<H2>AutoNation gets zoning OK for Dade store</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

  The Metro-Dade Commission approved a zoning application Thursday that will allow AutoNation USA to build its first used-car superstore in Dade County. An attorney for the Fort Lauderdale company said AutoNation plans to invest $10 million to open a 32,000-square-foot showroom on 15 acres at South Dixie Highway and Southwest 174th Street.<P>

   The company said it expects to employ 130 people at an average salary of $30,000. Community leaders said the project could spark other development in an area still suffering the aftershocks of Hurricane Andrew.<P>

   ``If we get this project approved, we can truly start to redevelop this area,'' said Steve Cranman, executive director of the Perrine Cutler Ridge Council.<BR>

<H2>Haas to invest $40M in Parlux Fragrances</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

  Parlux Fragrances said Haas Wheat & Partners Inc. agreed to invest $40 million in the fragrance and cosmetics company.<P>

   The investment, which is expected to close by the end of the summer, will be structured as a 10 percent pay-in-kind bond, which pays interest in the form of additional bonds, Parlux said.<P>

   Dallas-based Haas Wheat, a private investment firm, also will receive warrants to purchase up to 5 million Parlux common shares -- or about 25 percent of the fully diluted equity ownership -- at $11 a share, the company said.<P>

   Proceeds from the investment will be used to retire long-term debt and for general corporate purposes, including small acquisitions, Ilia Lekach, Parlux's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.<P>

   ``A partnership with the Haas Wheat firm will assist us in achieving the growth potential of Parlux Fragrances,'' Lekach said.<P>

   The Fort Lauderdale-based fragrance and cosmetics company, with 1995 revenue of $38.2 million, holds licenses to distribute several designer brands, including Perry Ellis, Todd Oldham and Fred Hayman Beverly Hills.<P>
