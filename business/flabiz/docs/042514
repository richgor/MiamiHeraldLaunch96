<m0>  Republic Industries, Wayne Huizenga's latest foray into the Fortune 500, announced the resignation of its chief financial officer Thursday (--) one day before the company's annual meeting of shareholders.<ep>
   The Fort Lauderdale company said Gregory K. Fairbanks resigned for personal reasons. It wouldn't elaborate.<ep>
   Fairbanks, 42, could not be reached for comment Thursday.<ep>
   Fairbanks has served as Republic's executive vice president and chief financial officer since Huizenga bought a <m4>Fairbanks<m2><ql>
<m0>controlling stake in the company last August. The Fairbanks-Huizenga association dates back to 1980. He was Huizenga's CFO at both Blockbuster Entertainment and Waste Management.<ep>
   Huizenga, Republic's chairman and chief executive, praised Fairbanks' contributions to the company.<ep>
   ``We will miss Greg, but respect his decision,'' Huizenga said in a statement. ``We appreciate his willingness to remain with the company through the first of July to assist us in making an orderly transition of his responsibilities.''<ep>
   The resignation is certain to raise shareholders' eyebrows, if not prompt questions at this morning's annual meeting. But Republic shareholders are a very contented lot: Since Huizenga took over, its common shares have grown tenfold in value.<ep>
   According to Republic's proxy statement, Fairbanks owns 300,000 Republic shares and has options to buy 34,000 more for $3.87 1/2 apiece.<ep>
   The resignation was announced after the market closed Thursday. Republic shares gained $1.62 1/2 to close at $37.87 1/2.<ql>
