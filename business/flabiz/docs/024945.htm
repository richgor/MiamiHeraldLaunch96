ike rapid-fire spritzes from a perfume bottle, Parlux Fragrances has been aiming at name brands and alliances to enhance its image and reach. Since last fall, the acquisition list of the perfume manufacturer and distributor has included Alexandra de Markoff, the classic Bal A Versailles and Richard Barrie Fragrances and its manufacturing plant.<P>

   Over the last two years, Parlux bought worldwide distribution rights to designer brand Perry Ellis and the fragrance business of Fred Hayman Beverly Hills. Last week, the Fort Lauderdale company wrapped up a deal with a Russian distributor. In November, the stock split two-for-one.<P>

   Considered shrewd and hard-bargaining, the brothers who run the 12-year-old company have shown the drive to expand. What they're looking for is the capital.<P>

   Parlux won't necessarily be a huge player like Estee Lauder, Proctor & Gamble and Unilever in the $5 billion fragrance industry, which is growing 2 to 3 percent a year, analysts say. But ``they're becoming more and more important'' in the mid-priced range, said Richard W. Edelman, an analyst with Southwest Securities in West Palm Beach.<P>

   In late February, Parlux shares rose 12 percent after the company said it had hired Solomon Brothers to consider ways to boost its stock price. For some, the move was an indication of possible suitors.<P>

   Chairman Ilia Lekach saw it differently. ``Any company that grows as fast as we are growing has an enormous need for capital,'' he said. ``It could be an acquisition. It could be a merger. It could be anything.<P>

   ``If you are buying our stock on speculation of this company being sold, you're buying the wrong stock.''<P>

Parlux is trying to negotiate an increase in its credit line from $5 million to $10 million. Debt for the nine months ending Dec. 31 was $14.9 million. Operating income was $10.6 million, compared to $4.6 million the year before.<P>

   And from the end of the March 1995 to the end of March this year, the stock went from $6.59 to $12.38. Shares closed Friday at $11.<P>

   ``They're always short of working capital,'' said Edelman. But, he said, the company has been growing 50 percent a year over the past few years.<P>

    In 1993, the company reported profits of $135,000; in 1994, $1.4 million and in 1995, $4.2 million. For the first nine months of the current year, net income was $5.6 million, compared to $2.6 million the year before.<P>

   Edelman called Ilia Lekach ``really a free thinker, very creative, well respected, not always well-liked.''<P>

   This is how three recent deals were structured, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents:<P>

   <LI> In September 1995, Parlux acquired from Revlon the assets and operations of Alexandra de Markoff, a prestige cosmetics line, for $8.6 million in cash and 424,000 shares of Parlux stock valued at $3.4 million. (Revlon and an affiliate sold 365,000 shares late last month at an average price of $10.91. They still hold the equivalent of 235,000 shares.)<P>

   <LI> In December 1994, Parlux bought worldwide manufacturing and distribution rights for Perry Ellis fragrances and beauty products for $7.5 million in cash and a $6.5 million, one-year note at 7 percent interest and secured by the assets.<P>

   <LI> In June 1994, Parlux bought Fred Hayman Beverly Hills for $2 million cash, 500,000 shares of Parlux stock, a short-term noninterest-bearing note for $2.5 million, and a 10-year, 7.25 percent note for nearly $6 million. Parlux also granted Fred Hayman an option to purchase 100,000 shares for a 10-year period at $4.50 a share, which was exercised in May 1995.<P>

  The market already is flooded with over 1,000 fragrances, an increase of several hundred in the last few years. And there are 10 to 12 major launches a year, said Allan Mottus, publisher of The Informationist, a health care and beauty trade publication.<P>

   Parlux hopes to be among them with the planned debut of Perry Ellis America this year and Fred Hayman's Hollywood in 1997. Both newly developed scents are framed by slick and kicky marketing videos.<P>

   ``They're just trying to get into as many different markets as they can,'' said Brett Pope, an analyst with First Dallas Securities. ``I think they know they're not going to be Estee Lauder.''<P>

   What they are trying to be is a company that builds an image through department store sales, which they say are not profitable, and a bottom line through outlets like Perfumania and Cosmetic Counter and aggressive international sales. Parlux said it has 2,600 U.S. outlets and distributors in 65 countries.<P>

   Bloomingdale's sees Parlux as a small but growing company. ``Like any new organization, they have gone through some growing pains,'' said Jane Scott, vice president of cosmetics and fragrances, ``but we love working with them.''<P>

   Ilia Lekach joined the Parlux board in 1989, took over as chairman in 1990 and as chief executive in November 1993. The company, created in 1984, moved to Florida from New York in 1993.<P>

  Of the six company directors, three are brothers: Ilia Lekach, the chairman; Rachmil, the president; and Zalman, the chief operating officer.<P>

    Parlux makes money internationally and with Perfumania, the Lekaches said. Ilia Lekach is a founder and former head of Perfumania, the Miami-based chain of discount perfume stores. He and Rachmil remain major stockholders. Sales to Perfumania, now run by the Lekaches' brothers-in-law, amounted to 37 percent of Parlux's net sales for the nine months ended Dec. 31.<P>

   ``Since they're a major supplier to Perfumania, they're creating products at a good price,'' said trade publisher Mottus. Parlux also is creating a niche in the growing market between the department stores and mass marketers.<P>

   Perfumania buys much of its stock from manufacturers, executives have said, instead of the so-called gray market. The gray market -- wholesalers and offshore companies that divert fragrances from manufacturers to different buyers -- is a fact of life in the industry, analysts say. Big-name perfume makers sell to department stores to protect their image. Parlux says it is not in the gray market.<P>

  In 1992, a lawsuit accused Perfumania of selling a fake shipment of perfume. The company denied the charges, and settled out of court. <P>

   One month after Parlux went to Solomon Brothers, Perfumania said it hired the investment bankers for advice on growth strategies, including the possible sale of the company.<P>

   Ilia Lekach said he left Perfumania because Parlux's operations are ``ten times more interesting.''<P>

   ``We are entrepreneurial,'' Lekach said. ``It's all marketing. Decisions are made very fast.''<P>

   In addition, the two brothers say, the business has very high gross margins.<P>

   And Parlux's margins are on the high side compared to their competitors, said Pope. Estee Lauder's net profit margin is close to 5 percent; Parlux is around 12, he said.<P>

   ``The big profit is getting a hot brand you can sell to other stores,'' Mottus said.<P>

   Smaller brands ``always have a following,'' he said. And ``companies like Parlux are really bottom fishers.''<P>

   In January, Parlux announced the purchase of Richard Barrie Fragrances, including a manufacturing and distribution center in Orange, Conn., and the Baryshnikov and Melrose Place fragrances.<P>

   In an SEC filing Apr. 22, Richard Barrie said that as of last December, the company had a negative net worth of $14,244.<P>

   The Richard Barrie acquisition will give Parlux a manufacturing facility and ``help them to save some cost and give them more control over their product,'' said Pope.<P>

   Parlux said it buys its bottles and other supplies in the United States and abroad and fills them primarily in New Jersey and Connecticut.<P>

    ``They're shrewd businessmen,'' Mottus said. ``They understand the movement and traffic of cosmetic brands.''<P>

     Parlux's rivals are active, too.<P>

     Miami-based French Fragrances, whose shelves include Halston and Geoffrey Beene fragrances, recently announced an agreement to buy several other prestigious brands.<P>

   ``We are good competitors,'' said company president Rafael Kravec. ``We know them well.''
