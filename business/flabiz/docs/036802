Some corporations like the possibility of splitting hockey and basketball apart, particularly in regard to in-arena advertising. The reason: The sports draw demographic- ally divergent crowds. For instance, hockey fans tend to be younger, and basketball attracts more women.<ql>

<m0>hen a game called Big Business collides with a business called Big Sports, the most obvious common denominator is Big Money.<ep>
  Teams collect it, players earn it and companies pay it, in the form of advertising and skybox sales.<ep>
  With South Florida set to multiply its indoor sports arenas by three (--) the original Miami Arena being joined by two new brethren (--) the question that marketers, sports economists and corporate budgetmeisters are asking is this:<ep>
  Is there going to be enough money to go around?<ep>
  ``It's a great question,'' said Doug Logan, commissioner of Major League Soccer and a well-known sports business consultant. ``You take a city like Miami, which doesn't have an overabundance of Fortune 500 companies, and it almost dictates choosing one over another. The war among facilities is going to be unbelievable.''<ep>
  It's a question being debated around the country, with virtually every major city, it seems, either unveiling or planning a new sports arena.<ep>
  The issue has particular relevance here because of the intertwining financial interest of companies, teams and public money. Also, South Florida is going against the grain (--) most communities, even much larger ones, have decided that economics mandate a two-team arena.<ep>
  The importance of economics is undeniable. Although precise details haven't been worked out, Broward estimates skybox and club seating would generate more than $15 million in revenues. Of that, approximately 51 luxury suites would generate $3.4 million in revenue, suggesting an average price of about $66,000 annually. The other $12 million would come from club seating, which isn't in a box but carries privileges such as preferred parking and advantageous floor position.<ep>
  In a typical entertainment venture, of course, investors risk their capital and take losses if it fails. In South Florida, however, the taxpayers are most at risk should the arenas founder. And in the case of the proposed arena for downtown Miami, the facility is scheduled to be built on a valuable community resource (--) downtown waterfront property.<ep>
  Central to the economic success will be the in-arena advertising and the sale of skyboxes to well-heeled patrons, most likely corporations and professional organizations such as law firms.<ep>
  But it won't be an easy sell. In the years since the Miami Arena's plans were first unveiled, the number of local companies that have folded or been merged out of existence include Eastern Airlines, AmeriFirst Bank, Pan Am, Southeast Bank, General Development Corp., CenTrust, International Medical Centers and Key Pharmaceuticals.<ep>
  The arena's 18 skyboxes have never sold out (--) the price of them is estimated at $75,000 to $100,000 annually (--) although poor design obviously played a role in that. Still, Joe Robbie Stadium, uniquely posi<m2><ql>

SKYBOXES,  FROM  1F<ql>
<m0>tioned to maximize the draw from both Dade and Broward, has only 155 of its 197 skyboxes leased (--) they go for $30,000 to $90,000 (--) and are up for renewal next year. Wayne Huizenga, owner of the Dolphins and Panthers, has said in the past that a dearth of local corporations makes skyboxes a tougher sell here for sports facilities.<ql>
<m1>Small businesses dominate<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Indeed, both Dade and Broward counties are dominated by small ventures, the kind that are less likely to have the tens of thousands of dollars annually to either advertise in an arena or purchase a skybox to entertain clients.<ep>
  Not helping matters, the collapse of much of the region's corporate infrastructure means corporate money is being shared by an ever-increasing number of well-meaning ventures, everything from the New World Symphony to the United Way.<ep>
  Whether companies will increase their expenditures is subject to question.<ep>
  ``It's going to be awfully tough,'' predicts Rick Nafe, president of the Stadium Managers Association and executive director of the Tampa Sports Authority. ``I think in situations like that what you find is a lot of red ink. The most successful arenas are those with two full-time tenants.''<ep>
  It's also worth noting that the South Florida economy has been in an expansion mode for several years. The sales job for skyboxes could become even more problematic should the region enter a recession (--) at least, that's been the case in other cities. However, most economic analysts say a downturn is likely years away.<ql>
<m1>Against the grain<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  There's no question that South Florida is going against the grain by building separate arenas for hockey and basketball. In Boston and Chicago, to name a couple of recent examples, economics mandated two-team arenas. Last week, Ross Perot Jr., son of the former presidential candidate, purchased a controlling interest in the Dallas Mavericks, an NBA team, and said he planned to link forces with the Dallas Stars hockey team for a new downtown arena.<ep>
  It's clear how crucial the economic impact of skyboxes can be to such a facility. In Chicago's new United Center, for instance, the cheapest skyboxes sell for as little as $55,000 (--) but there are more than 200 of them.<ep>
  The skyboxes are all sold out, according to Steve Schanwald, a spokesman for the United Center. Chicago, however, has one of the largest markets (--) and largest corporate communities (--) in the world. For South Florida, with a distinctly smaller market and different economic model, to duplicate that success in two arenas would be quite a feat.<ep>
  ``There certainly is a point in every market where suite saturation occurs,'' Schanwald said. ``The point varies depending on size of the market and the number of corporations in that market.''<ql>
<m1>Closer to home<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  At the same time, South Florida's unique geography and demographics could work in favor of corporate support for two arenas, some observers say.<ep>
  The arenas are going to be quite some distance apart, and the reality is that virtually all area corporations that would like a pro sports skybox will have the option of getting one close to home.<ep>
  Adding to this trend, in recent years a number of local companies (--) particularly larger banks (--) have separated their Dade and Broward operations, essentially setting up two headquarters sites and, in theory, expanding the number of potential skybox tenants.<ep>
  BellSouth, for instance, has offices in Dade and Broward, said spokesman Spero Canton. Now, Broward employees will have a strictly local institution to support. ``It expands the support base,'' he said.<ql>
<m1>Two separate markets<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Furthermore, some corporations like the possibility of splitting hockey and basketball apart, particularly in regard to in-arena advertising.<ep>
   The reason: The sports draw demographically divergent crowds. For instance, hockey fans tend to be younger, and basketball attracts more women.<ep>
  ``You have different promotional values for each team,'' said Bruce Mainer, executive vice president of marketing at Norwegian Cruise Lines, which sponsors a floor-level scoreboard at Miami Heat games. ``It's two very distinct markets.''<ql>
<m1>Support for both<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  Of course, some companies say they expect they'll continue to support both teams. The Sports Authority, the Fort Lauderdale-based sporting goods giant, has advertising deals with all four local teams now. It likely will continue those arrangements.<ep>
  ``We still want a relationship with the Heat, and we still want a relationship with the Panthers,'' said Kelly Conway, vice president of marketing.<ep>
  The Sports Authority, which advertises in more than 65 facilities throughout the country, does not buy skyboxes. ``We look at this as a sponsorship strategy, not as entertainment,'' Conway said.<ep>
  Office Depot advertises in more than 30 sports facilities, including the Miami Arena and Joe Robbie Stadium. It has a skybox at JRS.<ep>
  If new arenas are built, ``we would certainly strongly consider'' advertising in them, said Gary Schweikhart, spokesman for the Delray Beach-based chain of office supply superstores.<ql>
<m1>Specter of competition<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  But whether that kind of support will produce a windfall for the facilities is tough to predict, experts say. That's because the smart corporation is going to use the competition between arenas as a negotiating edge for lower rates, whether for ad space or skyboxes.<ep>
  ``The economic trend certainly benefits multi-use arenas,'' said Alan Friedman, executive editor of Team Marketing Report. ``There are a handful of companies that will try to get into any sports venture, but I think there are choices that will have to be made. Buying signs in both facilities essentially means doubling the money. Sooner or later they run out of prospects.''<ep>
