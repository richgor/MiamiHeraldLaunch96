<m1>I<m0>f you live abroad and need heart bypass surgery (--) or just a tummy tuck (--) South Florida's hospitals want you.<ep>
   As cost-conscious insurers siphon away patients, hospitals are casting about for new sources of income. Increasingly, they're looking to Latin American and the Caribbean.<ep>
   In those regions, more and more people are reaching the rungs of the middle class and buying health insurance that pays for medical care in the United States. And American hospitals, with only about half their beds filled on any given day, see servicing international patients as an additional source of income.<ep>
   The latest effort began in March, when Mercy Hospital in Coconut Grove and Miami Children's formed a joint international marketing alliance.<ep>
   ``It's an additional source of revenue to be developed, especially when you take into account that, domestically, revenue sources are diminishing,'' said Eugene Bajorinas, Mercy's marketing director.<ep>
   ``With cutbacks in Medicaid and Medicare,'' he said, ``most domestic hospitals are facing declining resources, therefore the need to develop your business internationally.''<ep>
   The joint effort makes sense, hospital officials say, in these days of consolidations and joint ventures as hospitals struggle to stay profitable.<ep>
   Mercy and Children's plan to split marketing costs, which they're not divulging. Children's Hospital will handle only pediatric cases; Mercy will provide care just to adults.<ep>
   Last year, nearly 4 percent of Children's 8,400 admissions were patients who live abroad. About 5 percent of Mercy's patients, or 5,000 people, lived outside the United States in 1995, according to hospital estimates. That compares with only about 1 percent three years ago.<ep>
   ``Marketing the full services of both adult and pediatric care through this alliance gives both facilities a strong competitive advantage,'' Bajorinas said. ``Increasingly, people are realizing Miami is a medical destination. For the longest time, that was not the case.''<ep>
   Details like scheduling appointments, finding accommodations, getting insurance help and even arranging travel assistance are handled by the hospitals' joint International Patient Services Department.<ep>
<m1>Marketing to the wealthy<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   The hospitals tout the expertise of their staffs and physicians. The aim is to attract wealthy people able to pay cash or those with insurance. Some hospitals have struck deals to treat military members or government workers.<ep>
   Latin America is a natural focus. Most international patients at Mercy, for example, come from Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.<ep>
   ``It's not like all the places are backward and unsophisticated,'' said Linda Quick, president of the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association. ``Santiago, Cali, Chile, Bogota (--) these places are not necessarily unsophisticated. But they may not have, countrywide, as much technology as we have.''<ep>
   The Mercy-Children's marketing team is readying brochures in English and Spanish to be mailed to medical associations and hospitals, so that when a doctor in a foreign country refers a patient to a specialist, Mercy-Children's will be first on the list.<ep>
   Ads will also run in foreign newspapers.<ep>
   Earlier this year, Mercy and Children's sponsored a joint teleconference seen by 8,000 physicians in 19 nations. Pediatricians from Children's provided medical information. An update by Mercy internal medicine specialists followed.<ep>
   The partners are also about to launch a health insurance plan to be marketed abroad. The preferred provider plan, underwritten by Business Men's Insurance of Miami, will pay for treatments conducted in the United States.<ep>
   Out-of-pocket prices will be lower if patients seek care at Mercy, Children's or related doctors and facilities.<ep>
<m1>Linking up with colleagues<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   The Mercy-Miami Children's linkup is far from the first in South Florida.<ep>
   Hospitals have prospected for patients beyond their borders for more than a decade. The main destinations for international patients have been well-respected medical centers in Boston, Baltimore, Houston, New York and Rochester, Minn.<ep>
   South Florida hospitals began recruiting in earnest in the late 1980s. Several court Latin and Caribbean physicians by offering continuing education.<ep>
At the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital, some of the foreign patients have been referred by Latin American doctors already on the hospital's staff who keep in touch with colleagues abroad. Foreign doctors who train at Jackson and return home also refer patients.<ep>
   Last year, nearly 9,400 foreign patients were treated at Jackson, out of 57,000 admitted.<ep>
Last fall, a consortium of hospitals and health-care companies touted South Florida's offerings at the Second Annual Health Ministers Conference. A similar effort is planned for the next conference, in Miami in September.<ep>
   Two years ago, four Miami hospitals hosted a conference in Caracas, Venezuela, that drew 700 Latin American physicians. The hospitals (--) Mercy and Baptist and Jackson in Miami, and Mount Sinai in Miami Beach (--) also advertised in Newsweek's international edition, sent to major companies and monied Latin American households.<ep>
   <m1><ep>
<m0>Several other South Florida hospitals are seeing small but steady increases in the number of international patients.<ep>
   At Baptist, the percentage has increased slightly, to about 6 percent. That's due in part to a $6 million, two-year contract with the Cayman Islands government to provide health care to government workers and their families.<ep>
   Cedars Medical Center treated about 1,000 international patients in 1995. To spread the word, Cedars launched Salud y Vigor last year, a glossy quarterly mailed to 21,000 American Express card holders in Latin America and the Caribbean.<ep>
<m1>Patients who don't pay<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   The effort to draw international patients can have a downside, though.<ep>
   Not everyone pays up. Jackson, for example, routinely spends money on caring for people who could or would not prove they were legally in the United States (--) $35 million last year.<ep>
   ``If you've done a really good job developing a relationship with a Brazilian pediatrician, he might want to send patients whether or not they have the resources,'' Quick said.<ep>
Not all hospitals are seeking foreign patients. Take Pan American Hospital in Miami, for example.<ep>
   While most South Florida hospitals have seen occupancy slip to less than 50 percent, Pan American is about 80 percent full. It hasn't found it necessary to invest in overseas promotions. The hospital sees only a half-dozen foreign patients annually.<ep>
   ``Sometimes I'm 99 percent occupied,'' said Carolina Calderin, chief executive of the 146-bed hospital. ``I only have capacity for people from Miami.''<ql>
