<m0>  Concerned that Americans know drug trafficker Pablo Escobar better than friendly coffee grower Juan Valdez, Colombia has launched a $2.35 million advertising campaign to improve its image.<ep>
   The first of a series of full-page ads appeared Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post under the headline, <m0>We Want To Clean Up Our Country For Our Children, Not Just Yours America.<m0><ep>
   Over the next 10 days, the ad will appear in other major newspapers including The Herald, USA Today and The Los Angeles Times. Other ads explaining Colombia's main exports (oil, flowers and coffee) and extolling the country's history and heritage, will follow.<ep>
   ``When Americans think Colombia, the first thing that crosses their minds is drugs, and there is a real concern in Colombia that business to Colombia and exports from Colombia are being affected by that,'' said Susan Kelley, principal of Kelley Swofford Roy, the Miami advertising agency handling the campaign. ``Our mission is to put the facts out there that Colombians are standing up in the struggle to fight drugs.''<ep>
   The campaign is being paid for by the public-private Fund for The Promotion of Colombian Exports, which is headed by Colombian Trade Minister Morris Harf.<ep>
   Harf hired the ad agency in March immediately after Colombia was decertified by the United States for its failure to stem the flow of narcotics.<ep>
   Countries that are dropped from the certification list are not eligible for U.S. economic assistance. In Colombia's case, that amounts to $46 million primarily to fund the anti-drug war. It also can mean other economic sanctions, though none have been taken against Colombia.<ep>
   ``The decertification was a terrible slap in the face for Colombia, and there is great fear that trade sanctions will be imposed,'' Kelley said. ``This campaign tells people that the Colombians are mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore.''<ql>
