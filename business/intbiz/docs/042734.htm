  Clad in red prison jumpsuits, leg irons and handcuffs, Cuban exile banker Orlando Castro Llanes and a son and grandson learned Friday what they had feared for a month: If they want to challenge larceny charges brought against them in New York, they must do so there, not from Miami.<P>

   At an extradition hearing packed with supportive fellow exiles, Dade Circuit Judge Alex Ferrer declared there was little he could do but approve the Castros' extradition to Manhattan, where a grand jury has alleged they diverted millions from depositors in their own bank.<P>

   At the center of a crippling banking crisis in Venezuela, the elder Castro, 71, was arrested April 3 along with his son, Orlando Jr., and grandson, Jorge, on warrants from the office of New York District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.<P>

   Once the overseer of a 13,000-employee business empire that encompassed banks, insurance companies and media properties in Venezuela, Castro and his family took refuge in Miami after government authorities seized his holdings and accused him of fraud and embezzlement.<P>

   Although Venezuela has not issued an extradition request, Morgenthau's office determined that fraud was committed in New York when Castro funneled money through the city from a bank he controlled in Puerto Rico to a bank he controlled in Caracas. An indictment alleges depositors in Puerto Rico were bilked out of $55 million.<P>

   Miami attorney Richard Sharpstein sought and failed to persuade the judge to step outside the arcane boundaries of extradition procedures and hear a jurisdictional challenge to the New York allegations. He said he was prepared to argue that no crime was committed in New York because the indictment never listed any victims.<P>

   ``The jurisdiction issue must be decided in New York,'' Ferrer replied.<P>

   But he delayed the Castros' transfer to New York for at least seven days so they could appeal his ruling to the Third District Court of Appeal in Miami.<P>

   Outside the courtroom, angry exile supporters likened the manacling of the Castros to the treatment of political prisoners in the jails of Cuban leader Fidel Castro.<P>

   Orlando Castro, his son and grandson were placed in solitary cells and labeled escape risks after a representative of the Venezuelan consulate in Miami told jailers that the senior Castro was on Venezuela's 10-most-wanted list.<P>

   ``There is no reason a 70-year-old should be chains,'' said Maria Magdalena Carrazana, who recalled that her own father had spent time in a Cuban jail when she was child. ``I know how that man is feeling.''<P>

   Other supporters complained that it was curious that Orlando Castro, a Cuban by birth, is the only one among the many bankers who have fled Venezuela for Miami to be charged with wrongdoing. Of the more than 20 banks that failed in Venezuela, Castro's Banco Progreso was among the last to go, said another supporter, Eladio Armesto.<P>

   ``If we would see the other bankers indicted, no problem'' he said. ``They are after one banker: Orlando Castro.''
