   WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole endorsed the heart of President Clinton's trade policy toward China on Thursday, even as he hammered the president for ``weakness and indecision and double-talk.''<P>

   In his first major foreign policy speech of the 1996 campaign, Dole used words such as ``scattershot'' and ``amateurish'' in an effort to portray Clinton as an unreliable partner for America's allies and a poor match for America's toughest foes.<P>

   ``The president of the United States does not always mean what he says,'' charged Dole, who is battling a 20-point deficit in opinion polls. ``No more can we afford an inattentive, incoherent, vacillating and reactive posture from the leader of the free world.''<P>

   Yet Dole strongly endorsed an extension of Most Favored Nation trading advantages to China, despite Beijing's intransigence on a host of U.S. complaints, from human rights abuses to the pirating of compact disks.<P>

He favors China<BR>
   Dole said the United States could not expect to influence China by withdrawing most-favored-nation status, under which the United States extends favorable tariff rates to most of its trading partners. Rather, he asserted, such a policy would harm American business while signaling a U.S. retreat from the region.<P>

   The speech illustrated Dole's dilemma as he tries to distance himself from Clinton on foreign policy. The task is difficult, partly because they share a number of broad positions and partly because foreign policy, once seen as a Clinton liability, is viewed increasingly as a strength.<P>

   No immediate threats to American security appear on the public's radar screen.<P>

   Things have gone well in Haiti and Bosnia after Clinton's politically unpopular decisions to send U.S. troops. Trade tensions with Japan have been unusually moderate. The bottom has not fallen out of the president's Mexican economic bail-out.<P>

   Russian relations are bumping along passably. Ties with Israel are stronger than ever. The administration is closely identified with the search for Middle East peace.<P>

In surer hands<BR>
   Against this backdrop, Dole sought to make his case Thursday that the White House conduct of international affairs will be in surer hands if he is elected in November. He said the president's foreign policy is a mess of hems and haws that only sometimes redeems itself by coming up with the right answer.<P>

   ``No more overnight reversals, no more conflicting signals and no more strategic incoherence,'' Dole said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ``Our future security depends on American leadership that is respected, American leadership that is trusted and, when necessary, American leadership that is feared.''<P>

   Dole traced a series of policy confusions, including Clinton's well-documented reversal on China trade policy.<P>

   As a candidate in 1992, Clinton accused President Bush of coddling ``dictators'' in Beijing. As president, he became the first chief executive to link progress on human rights to most-favored-nation trading status. One year later, he abandoned the policy and eliminated the linkage.<P>

   Dole said Clinton had not defined a ``coherent strategy for dealing with China, nor how [most favored nation] extension fits into that strategy.''.
