<FONT SIZE=-1><I><B>ANXIOUS MOMENTS: </B>A couple stop at ValuJet's ticket counter at Miami 
International Airport on Saturday to inquire about the crash.</I></FONT>
<HR WIDTH=80% SIZE=2 ALIGN=center NOSHADE>

<P>They came to Miami International Airport with a question they were 
afraid to have answered.</P>

<P>    Carrying babies and even herding dogs on a leash leashes -- their 
stoicism belying the chaos that suddenly had beset their lives -- friends 
and relatives of some of the passengers aboard ValuJet Flight 592 were 
quickly ushered past the ticket counter Saturday afternoon by Metro-Dade 
police and airport personnel.</P>

<P>    Often walking arm in arm, finding strength in groups of three and 
four, they were led up back stairs seldom seen by travelers and ushered 
into a third-floor auditorium on Concourse B that in times such as these 
becomes the airport's crisis center.</P>

 <P> "Please, my husband was on that plane. Please, my husband was on that 
plane," one woman repeated time and time again.</P>

<P>   A ValuJet employee -- a woman who has been with the airline for just 
only a month -- waited just inside the auditorium door with the DC-9's 
passenger list. Some people would go no farther.</P>

  <P>"They told us he was on the plane," Barbara Varcelo cried out as she 
and her mother spun around just inside the door. "But they haven't told 
us anything."</P>

<P>   Barbara Varcelo's grandfather, Alberto Varcelo, 60, of Hialeah, had 
been flying to Atlanta.</P>

<B>Counselors on hand</B>

<P>   Metro-Dade police crisis counselors and volunteers from the American 
Red Cross and Salvation Army awaited family members inside. They could 
offer coffee, soft drinks, sandwiches and cookies, and a bank of phones Ä 
but little the families could really use.</P>

<P>   "The material things are being taken care of," said Metro-Dade 
Fire- Rescue Capt. Allen Brown. "They have food, diapers for the 
babies.</P>

   <P>"They need information. They want to grieve, and that's what they're 
doing."</P>

   <P>Alicia Marquez, an MIA airport spokeswoman, could do nothing more than 
watch as a man in his 50s learned (that his) wife had been aboard the 
plane.</P>

   <P>"He was openly crying," Marquez said.</P>

<B>Hope would fade</B>
<P>    At any one time, a (A) couple of dozen people waited for any 
glimmer of hope they sensed would never come.</P>

<P>    "We saw the pictures on television," one man said. "We know 
there's no hope."</P>

  <P>  There was no television in the crisis room.</P>
