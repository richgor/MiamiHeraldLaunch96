<H2>Airline returned aging DC-9s to skies</H2>

<P> The DC-9 has long been a workhorse of U.S. aviation.</P>

<P>   From 1958 to 1975, McDonnell Douglas and its predecessor Douglas 
Aircraft manufactured 976 of them.</P>

<P>   "It is one of the most reliable planes in aviation history," ValuJet 
President Lewis Jordan said Saturday.</P>

  <P> But as the airline industry upgraded to bigger, newer planes in the 
late 1980s, many of the old DC-9s were being retired. </P>

<P>   But DC-9s returned to the skies -- primarily because of ValuJet, an 
Atlanta carrier that began buying the used planes at cheap prices. 
ValuJet's 51-airplane fleet included 48 DC-9s.</P>

<P>   The DC-9-32 that crashed Saturday was built in 1969, Jordan said. It 
was one of the first four planes purchased by ValuJet, which began flying 
in October 1993 with two airplanes.</P>

<P>   Jordan said the plane, with a tail registration of N904VJ, had 
undergone regularly scheduled maintenance, including light maintenance in 
May and March, and heavier maintenance in October.</P>

<P>   Experts cautioned that it is too early to speculate about the cause 
of Saturday's crash, but some recalled other fatal DC-9 crashes.</P>

<P>   The most recent occurred in 1994 near North Carolina's 
Charlotte-Douglas Airport, when a DC-9-30 crashed in a thunderstorm, 
killing 37 of 57 people on board.</P>

<P>   In 1983, an Air Canada DC-9 flying from Dallas to Toronto made an 
emergency landing at the Greater Cincinnati Airport after a fire broke 
out on the plane about 90 minutes into the flight. Twenty-three people 
were killed.</P>

<P>   Testimony at a National Transportation Safety Board hearing on that 
crash centered on the plane's electrical system, particularly the wiring 
in the toilet-flushing motor in a rear lavatory.</P>

  <P> Also in 1994, a DC-9 flown by British tour operator Airtours made an 
emergency landing in Manchester, England, after a fire broke out in the 
rear galley. No one was killed.</P>

<P>   Investigators will be somewhat hampered in their investigation of 
Saturday's crash because the DC-9 has an old-style flight recorder, which 
measures only nine different aircraft functions, said an NTSB official.</P>

<P>   Newer airplanes have black boxes with 70 sensors measuring functions 
including air speed, throttle position, engine speed and fuel and 
electrical readings.</P>

<P>   Bill Tiedeman, a former Eastern pilot who flew the DC-9 for 12 years, 
said it is too early to say what caused the fire.</P>

<P>  "Smoke in the cockpit in itself is not all that serious," he said. 
"A lot of little things can happen in an airplane."</P>

  <P> Tiedeman noted that in Miami's previous worst airplane crash, in 1972, 
there were no major problems with the L1011 that went down in the 
Everglades.</P>

<P>   "It crashed because no one was paying attention,'' he said. "All 
three guys in the cockpit were working on the problem. No one was flying 
the airplane."</P>
