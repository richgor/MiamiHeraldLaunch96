<m0>   <m0>NEW YORK <m0>(--) Crews working around the clock got public transportation back on track Sunday after a burst water main near Times Square closed busy avenues and flooded West Side subway stations.<ep>
   A 48-inch water main, installed in 1902, burst Saturday afternoon at 40th Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue. The cause was unknown.<ep>
   The rupture filled streets with water and flooded subway tunnels as far south as 14th Street. Power had to be shut off to several Manhattan subway lines throughout the night to prevent electrical fires. Some buildings in the area lost power for 27 hours.<ql>
