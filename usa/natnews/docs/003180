<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) A proposed rollback of gasoline taxes to help motorists cope with soaring prices cleared a key House committee Thursday, and Republican leaders said they expect final action before Memorial Day.<ep>
   The House Ways and Means Committee advanced legislation that would suspend the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax for seven months, despite warnings by Democratic lawmakers that oil companies, not consumers, are most likely to benefit.<ep>
   Nevertheless, some tax relief for motorists has been gaining bipartisan support in this election year. The rollback, first proposed two weeks ago by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the prospective GOP presidential nominee, was accepted Wednesday by President Clinton.<ep>
   But Clinton said he would sign the measure only in tandem with legislation that would raise the $4.25 minimum wage. The minimum wage issue has stalled a vote on gas tax relief in the Senate most of this week.<ep>
   House Speaker News Gingrich, R-Ga., said he expects the full House to vote on the rollback within two weeks.<ep>
   The proposal is not without controversy.<ep>
   ``This is political pandering,'' said Rep. Sam Gibbons of Tampa, the ranking Democrat on the panel. <m1> <m0>He suggested there was no need to cut the gasoline tax to deal with what most economists believe is a temporary price spike.<ep>
