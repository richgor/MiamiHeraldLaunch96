<m0>   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (--) (AP) (--) Hammering away at Jim McDougal's claims of innocence, a prosecutor confronted President Clinton's former Whitewater partner Wednesday with a blizzard of memos and financial documents tying him to more than $1 million in allegedly fraudulent loans.<ep>
   McDougal, testifying at his fraud trial for a second straight day, said he had been victimized by ``admitted criminals'' such as David Hale who are ``working for'' Whitewater prosecutors.<ep>
   McDougal is suffering from a partially blocked artery and other health problems, and the former savings and loan owner appeared tired, addressing the jury in a low voice that was sometimes hard to hear.<ep>
   McDougal and his former wife, Susan, are on trial with Gov. Jim Guy Tucker.<ep>
   Tucker and McDougal are accused of conspiring to defraud McDougal's S&L and Hale's government-backed lending company of more than $2.5 million in loans. Susan McDougal is charged in connection with a $300,000 loan that has never been repaid.<ep>
   The McDougals were Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton's partners in the Whitewater land venture. Hale, the prosecution's star witness in the case against the McDougals, has said that then-Gov. Clinton benefited in the mid-1980s from an illegal $300,000 loan (--) an allegation the president has denied.<ep>
   The jury is expected to hear Clinton's videotaped testimony when McDougal leaves the stand.<ep>
   Prosecutor Ray Jahn suggested that McDougal and Tucker engaged in a fictitious $1 million sale of a sewer and water facility financed entirely by McDougal's S&L and Hale's lending company. The purpose of the sale, Jahn said, was so that McDougal could show a profit on the books of his S&L for federal bank examiners to see.<ep>
   When McDougal said he had little to do with the deal, Jahn produced a memo by McDougal directing a subordinate at the S&L to hire a particular appraiser to value the property.<ep>
   At another point, Jahn presented documents showing that Tucker bore no personal financial risk in the deal. <ep>
   McDougal replied that the deal had been thoroughly investigated years ago and had been found to be proper.<ep>
   Jahn said that a key part of the transaction was never put on paper (--) and that if it had been, it would have alerted the bank examiners that this was not ``a true sale.''<ep>
   McDougal replied that Jahn's conclusion was based on the testimony of ``admitted criminals'' such as Hale, who testified for the prosecution nine days earlier in the trial. Hale has pleaded guilty to defrauding the government and was sentenced to more than two years in prison.<ep>
