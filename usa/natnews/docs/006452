<m0>    <m0>NEW HAVEN<m0> (--) A member of the billionaire Bass family of Texas is donating $20 million to Yale University, one year after his brother withdrew the same amount in a dispute with the school.<ep>
   The new donation from Robert M. Bass, a 1971 Yale graduate, and his wife, Anne, will help renovate the Ivy League school's aging residential colleges, where most undergraduates live and eat for three of their four years at Yale.<ep>
   Lee M. Bass, a 1979 alumnus, donated $20 million in 1991 to establish a program in Western civilization, but Yale returned the sum last year. Bass complained that the university kept him in the dark about what was happening with the program, which was never set up.<ql>

   Last week, it was revealed that the Registry of Motor Vehicles had sent him to a driver re-education program because of five speeding violations, three citations for causing accidents and two arrests for driving with a suspended license.<ql>
