   WASHINGTON -- (AP) -- Violent crime dropped 4 percent last year as overall serious offenses reported to police declined for the fourth year in a row. But one expert said a slight increase in larceny foreshadows a surge in youth crime.<P>

   Reporting Sunday on preliminary data for 1995, the FBI said the overall total for seven major crimes was down 2 percent from 1994. Overall reported crime was down in every region, led by a 4 percent decline in the Northeast.<P>

   Scholars, law enforcement officers and Democratic and Republican members of Congress hailed the data but unanimously warned that the large national trends mask an alarming rise in teenage violence.<P>

   ``We shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., chairman of the House crime subcommittee.<P>

   Attorney General Janet Reno pledged to ``continue to put more cops on the beat, get guns off the street and put violent criminals behind bars.''<P>

   In cities of more than 1 million residents, overall reported crime fell by 6 percent. Suburban counties and most midsize cities also reported declines, but rural counties showed a 3 percent increase.<P>

   Among violent crimes, murder dropped the most -- 8 percent. Robbery was down 7 percent; rape 6 percent; and aggravated assault 3 percent.<P>

   Total property crimes dropped 1 percent, with auto theft down by 6 percent and burglary 5 percent.<P>

   The only increase was in larceny-theft -- up 1 percent.<P>

   Broward's crime rate decreased almost 11 percent in 1995, while in Dade it dropped less than a percentage point, according to a report released last month by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Statewide, the decline was the largest in 13 years.<P>

   ``This is the first glimmer of the impact of the next generation,'' said Professor Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie-Mellon University, ``because larceny -- such as bicycle theft, stealing auto parts and shoplifting -- is the crime with the youngest criminals. The peak age for larcenists is 15 or 16.'' Most burglars and robbers are older.<P>

   ``In the other crimes, what's going on among teenagers is being swamped by much larger numbers of older folks who are growing out of the high crime ages and giving up crime,'' Blumstein added.<P>

   James Alan Fox, dean of criminal justice at Northeastern University, said ``this calm before the crime storm won't last much longer.''<P>

   The murder rate for teenagers grew by 22 percent between 1990-94, Fox said. ``Over the next 10 years, the teen population will expand by 17 percent, because there are now 39 million children under age 10, more than we've had since the 1950s when the Baby Boomers were in grade school.''<P>

   In addition to citing the aging of Baby Boomers, experts and officials attributed the four-year crime decline to closer police work with citizens, longer prison sentences for violent criminals, crackdowns on illegal guns, declining unemployment and rising public intolerance for crime.<P>

   While acknowledging national trends in aging and unemployment, Police Chief Darrell W. Stephens of St. Petersburg said chiefs around the country also see improvements in specific neighborhoods where their officers have adopted ``community policing that builds a partnership with citizens.''<P>

   Overall crime in St. Petersburg is ``26 percent below what we had in 1989,'' said Stephens, who headed during 1986-92 the Police Executive Research Forum, an organization of chiefs who encourage new techniques.<P>

   In neighborhoods with drug dealing, St. Petersburg has ``citizens supported by police on the street night after night confronting the dealers and telling them to move on,'' Stephens said, citing a technique borrowed from Philadelphia.<P>

   ``We close rental properties for up to a year if they are used as a crack or drug house,'' Stephens said. Using an idea from Portland, Ore., St. Petersburg police ``help landlords set up systems to screen and monitor tenants and train community residents to train other landlords.''
