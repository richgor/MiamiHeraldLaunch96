   WASHINGTON -- (AP) -- The former top loan officer of an Arkansas bank testified Wednesday that he approved a $20,000 unsecured loan for the Whitewater real estate venture under pressure from Bill Clinton's emissaries.<P>

   Don Denton told the Senate Whitewater Committee that in 1978 he approved the loan, contrary <BR>
to his usual practice as senior lending officer at Union National Bank of Little Rock, because the bank's owner had told him he wanted Clinton to have it.<P>

   At the time, Clinton was Arkansas' attorney general, running for governor and widely viewed as a rising political star. In that climate, Denton said, Clinton allies urged him to approve the loan for a down payment on the Whitewater property purchased by the Clintons and their partners, James and Susan McDougal.<P>

   Later, when the loan was not repaid on time, Denton said he did not revoke the loan, as he would usually have done because it was granted as a favor by the bank. The loan was repaid in full in June 1980.<P>

   Denton later became a chief lending officer for Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, the failed Little Rock thrift owned by James McDougal while Clinton was Arkansas' governor.<P>

   Denton told the senators that McDougal ``very frequently'' moved money around and used a loan from one bank to pay off a loan from another.<P>

   Denton has been granted immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony against the McDougals and Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker in their federal criminal trial in Little Rock. <P>

   Denton has said he approved numerous loans for James McDougal while working for Union National Bank, including loans to McDougal and Tucker to buy and convert apartments to condominiums in 1979. He also approved financing for McDougal's purchase of the Bank of Kingston.<P>

   At the Senate hearing, Republicans kept up their criticism of the belated discovery in the White House residence last year of billing records for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Arkansas law firm.<P>

   On Tuesday, the Whitewater panel's Republican counsel said that only six people, including President Clinton and the first lady, may have handled the long-sought documents that mysteriously turned up in the Clintons' living quarters.<P>

   The other four people on the Republicans' list are the president's brother, Roger Clinton, and his wife, Molly; Susan Thomases, a confidant of the first lady; and White House aide Bruce Lindsey.<P>

   The records detail work performed by Hillary Clinton on behalf of Madison.
