  They came to Miami International Airport bearing grief and a question they were afraid to have answered.<P>

  Carrying babies and even herding dogs on a leash -- their stoicism belying the chaos that suddenly had beset their lives -- friends and relatives of some of the passengers aboard ValuJet Flight 592 were quickly ushered past the ticket counter Saturday afternoon by Metro-Dade police and airport personnel.<P>

  Often walking arm in arm, finding strength in groups of three and four, they were led up back stairs seldom seen by travelers and ushered into a third-floor auditorium on Concourse B that in times such as these becomes the airport's crisis center.<P>

  ``Please, my husband was on that plane. Please, my husband was on that plane,'' one woman repeated time and time again.<P>

   A ValuJet official with a passenger list from the DC-9 that crashed earlier in the afternoon waited just inside the auditorium door. Some people would go no farther.<P>

   ``They told us he was on the plane,'' Barbara Varcelo cried out as she and her mother spun around just inside the door. ``But they haven't told us anything.''<P>

   Barbara Varcelo's grandfather, Alberto Varcelo, 60, of Hialeah, had been flying to Atlanta.<P>

   Metro-Dade police crisis counselors and volunteers from the American Red Cross and Salvation Army awaited family members inside. They could offer coffee, soft drinks, sandwiches and cookies, and a bank of phones -- but little the families could really use.<P>

    At any one time, 10 or 20 people waited for any glimmer of hope they sensed would never come.<P>

    ``We saw the pictures on television,'' one man said. ``We know there's no hope.''<P>

    There was no television in the crisis room.
