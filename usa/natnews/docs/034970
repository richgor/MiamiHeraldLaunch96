<m0>   Richard E. Byrd, the famed polar explorer who claimed in 1926 (--) 70 years ago Thursday (--) to have been the first person to fly over the North Pole, may actually have turned back two hours and 150 miles short of his goal, according to new evidence found at Ohio State University. <m1> <ep>
<m0>   The clues are in Byrd's long-lost diary of the expedition, which an archivist at the Byrd Polar Research Institute recently found in a mislabeled box of memorabilia. The diary contains navigational notes that Dennis Rawlins, a Baltimore navigation expert and historian of polar expeditions, has interpreted to mean that Byrd failed in his attempt at the pole even though he claimed to have reached it.<ep>
   One incriminating finding: The diary contains an erased (--) but readable (--) sextant reading that put Byrd about 165 miles south of where he would later claim, in his official report, to have been at that moment toward the end of the flight north.<ep>
   If confirmed, Byrd's disqualification would hand the title of ``first person to reach the North Pole'' to Roald Amundsen, the Norwegian explorer who traveled over the pole in a dirigible three days after Byrd's airplane flight (--) arriving there May 12, 1926.<ep>
  Amundsen's claim, is documented by detailed navigational records and corroborated by experts who traveled with him. It has never been in doubt. <m1>   <m0>Byrd's claim to have flown over the North Pole was controversial in its day. One reason was that he failed to drop the hundreds of U.S. flags he carried to prove his priority to Amundsen, a longtime rival who he knew would be arriving days later.<ep>
   Critics in Byrd's time alleged that instead of flying toward the pole, the explorer and his pilot, Floyd Bennett, simply flew out of sight of the international press corps that saw him off from the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, wandered for many hours and returned.<ep>
   Rawlins said, however, that the diary establishes that Byrd, brother of Virginia's then-Gov. Harry Byrd, did indeed attempt the pole, venturing some 600 miles over the ice in a primitive Fokker trimotor. Moreover, the diary indicates that Byrd's navigation was on target, disputing an old allegation that he lacked the skill to find his way above the trackless ice sheet.<ep>
   But, Rawlins said, ``What we find in his diary is not consistent with Byrd getting all the way to the pole.''<ep>
   Rawlins, a longtime specialist in skeptical analyses of ancient claims involving astronomy or navigation, publishes a journal called DIO that focuses on these subjects and has carried articles critical of Byrd and of Robert E. Peary, who said he reached the North Pole by dog sled in 1909.<ep>
   The Byrd Center asked Rawlins to analyze Byrd's diary earlier this year after it was found in a mislabeled, misdated box among the vast collection of the explorer's papers held at the center. The Byrd center is one of the largest devoted to modern scientific study of polar climates, geology, geography and biology.<ep>
   ``When we realized these were notes from 1926, we called in Dennis because of his prominence in this field,'' said Raimund E. Goerler, chief archivist at the center in Ohio. <m1> <m0>``He's very well qualified to make this kind of analysis.''<ep>
   Goerler said neither he nor the Byrd Center endorses Rawlins's interpretation. ``Our job simply is to make his findings available,'' he said. In fact, Goerler said he believes the diary's words make it clear that Byrd believed he had reached the pole at the time of the flight.<ep>
   Goerler based his conclusion on Byrd's diary entry, ``We should be at the pole.'' To Rawlins, the ``should'' implies doubt about a thing that would, upon return to land, be asserted as fact. To Goerler, the wording is entirely consistent with certainty, at least during the flight.<ep>
