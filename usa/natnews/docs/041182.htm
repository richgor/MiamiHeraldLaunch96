   DALLAS -- (AP) -- Middle-age men who drink milk may reduce their risk of the most common type of stroke, a study released Monday suggests.<P>

   But the study also noted that the milk-drinking men studied tended to have healthy lifestyles that could be the cause of their lower stroke risk.<P>

   The 22-year study looked at 3,150 men of Japanese ancestry from middle age to old age. Men who didn't drink milk were twice as likely to have a thromboembolic stroke as men who drank at least 16 ounces a day. Thromboembolic strokes account for 70 to 80 percent of all strokes.<P>

   The study suggested that the difference wasn't because of the calcium in milk.<P>

   Also, it was not clear which was the more important factor: the milk itself or the lifestyles of the men who drank it, said Robert Abbott, lead author on the study published in the May issue of the American Heart Association journal Stroke.<P>

   ``These factors are difficult to identify, but milk drinkers tended to be leaner and more physically active and to consume foods that were more likely to be healthy,'' said Abbott, a biostatistician at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.<P>

   The study was conducted as part of the Honolulu Heart Program, which began in the late 1960s and has provided data to study a variety of factors that may cause strokes.<P>

   The men studied lived on the Hawaiian island of Oahu and were between 55 and 68 years old in 1965, when they were enrolled in the program.
