<m0>   WEST COVINA, Calif. (--) (AP) (--) A 71-year-old woman caught in a squeeze between the Internal Revenue Service and a mortgage company tried to rob a gas station at gunpoint, police say.<ep>
   Mary Ruth Blanco, a grandmother who has served as a foster parent for scores of needy children over the past 35 years, was arrested Saturday for investigation of attempted armed robbery. She was jailed on $50,000 bail.<ep>
   ``I want people to understand that Mary is a very good, sweet person and she is not a criminal,'' said her 75-year-old husband, Raymond Blanco. ``I don't think she even knew what she was doing.''<ep>
   The Blancos learned last week that the IRS was going to appropriate half of his pension check (--) $750 (--) for eight months. A few days later, their mortgage company threatened to foreclose over $900 in unpaid property taxes.<ep>
   Mrs. Blanco was also ill with diabetes and helping to care for her daughter, son-in-law and 2 1/2-week-old granddaughter.<ep>
   On Saturday, authorities said, she took a relative's pistol, drove to a self-serve gas station anddemanded the clerk empty the register. The clerk, safe behind bulletproof glass, called police instead and wrote down the woman's license plate number. Police traced her to her home.<ep>
   ``The stress of these bills, the letters, the payments, the sicknesses (--) they all combined to make her go over the top,'' Blanco said. ``My wife is not the type of person to do this thing. It's just something that overtook her.''<ep>
   She faces a mandatory sentence of at least 4 1/3 years in prison if convicted.<ep>
