<H2>Adoption's unmet needs</H2>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>MISPLACED SUBSIDIES Helping families adopt healthy babies is important. But what about kids who need help?</B></I></FONT><P>
<!-- end headlines -->
inflates expenses paid to birth mothers of white infants), because most healthy babies are adopted quickly. And it does very little for children who now can spend years, if not a lifetime, waiting for a family and home. <P>

   The bill, now endorsed by President Clinton, would give a $5,000 tax credit for adoption-related expenses. Parents earning up to $75,000 could use the full credit over five years; those earning up to $115,000 would get part of it. This would cost the government $1.7 billion over seven years. Republicans would replace that money by tougher anti-fraud measures governing foreign trusts and by repealing a useful tax break that encourages businesses to buy energy conservation devices.<P>

   Some private adoptions can cost more than $20,000 for legal fees and expenses of the birth mother. The tax credit also covers expenses and fees of adopting babies from abroad.<P>

   However, little in the bill encourages <BR>
Americans to look across town for children of color, older children, sibling groups, and children with health problems. Yes, the legislation does ban state restrictions on interracial adoptions. But most states, including Florida, already have dropped these restrictions.<P>

   Still, Florida has more than 1,700 children in foster care. Some will get placed, however, because the state and federal governments provide subsidies, averaging $300 a month in Florida, to help families absorb the cost of, say, taking in three siblings or of adopting a child with medical problems. <P>

   Rather than enhancing those subsidies or other aid to the states for services to foster children, various versions of welfare reform have lumped them into block grants. Such relatively small sums, child advocates fear, would be swallowed by other forms of social service.     Of course, it's hard to argue against giving some aid to parents who adopt any child. Birth parents can take advantage of insurance or tax deductions for birth expenses, after all. But at least part of that $1.7 billion would be better spent helping find and even support parents who stretch their hearts and wallets on behalf of children whom nobody rushes to adopt.<BR>
