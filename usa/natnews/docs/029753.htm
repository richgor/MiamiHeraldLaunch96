   WASHINGTON -- Bob Dole is ``nasty.'' His stump speech is ``pathetically unconvincing.'' His party marches in a ``separatist, extremist direction.'' White House spokesman Mike McCurry doesn't mince his words.<P>

   With the presidential campaign heating up, the longtime political operative has become part press secretary, part pit bull.<P>

   Just recently, he:<P>

   <LI> Accused Dole, the presumptive GOP nominee, of ``trying to squirm away'' from raising the minimum wage.<P>

   <LI> Called the Senate majority leader's campaign themes ``remarkably unconvincing, just kind of tired arguments that echoed from the past.''<P>

   <LI> Responded with sarcasm to a question about President Clinton's plans to pre-empt ``Dole's issues.'' Said McCurry: ``I don't know that Senator Dole had any issues that needed to be pre-empted.''<P>

   <LI> Took a jab at Dole as fellow Republicans criticized their standard-bearer. ``Dole's been hurt so bad,'' McCurry said with mock sympathy. ``I don't think we're going to try to pile on him.''<P>

   With few exceptions, McCurry's barbs come with a smile or a wink. He says that's a signal to reporters: Don't take this too seriously; it's just politics.<P>

   He still regrets implying in November that Republicans want senior citizens, like Medicare, to ``just die and go away.'' He apologized for the remark.<P>

   ``I hope I'm not mean, because I don't think mean is becoming,'' McCurry said in a recent interview.<P>

   Clinton on Wednesday chided Republicans for criticizing him in ``intense personal terms'' and added, ``you've never heard me doing that.'' Of course, he has McCurry to do it for him.<P>

   From his long, horseshoe-shaped desk in a spacious West Wing office, McCurry acknowledged that he has sharpened his attacks as Dole and fellow Republicans grow more partisan.<P>

   ``I need to help move the president's point of view effectively and that requires being sharply partisan on occasion,'' McCurry said.<P>

   The demanding 24-hour news cycle, which McCurry says ``overheats the political rhetoric,'' will keep pressure on him and other White House aides to defend their boss.<P>

   ``I think Mike has probably been more partisan than previous White House press secretaries,'' said Tony Blankley, House Speaker Newt Gingrich's spokesman and a frequent McCurry sparring partner. ``I don't fault him for that; I've probably been more partisan than previous Hill press secretaries.''<P>

   But Nelson Warfield, Dole's campaign spokesman, said voters will ``see through'' McCurry's efforts to justify Clinton's record and may be troubled by such a partisan tone from a government employee.<P>

   McCurry said his main concern this election season is losing credibility on weightier topics unrelated to the election.<P>

   ``We can defend and advance the president's case, but we also have to recognize that we have a fundamental responsibility to just get the information out the door every day,'' he said.<P>

   Nobody should be surprised by McCurry's style. He has been in the thick of Democratic politics since serving as spokesman for the voluble Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., in the early 1980s.<P>

   He went on to become press secretary and adviser in the Democratic presidential primary campaigns of Sen. John Glenn of Ohio in 1984, former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt in 1988 and Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska in 1992.<P>

   Henry Graff, a Columbia University political science professor, said all press secretaries reflect their presidents -- and all presidents are political.<P>

   ``As the administration gets more and more partisan closer to the election,'' Graff said, ``the voice of the president will become more and more partisan.''<P>

   At times, Clinton objects to the tone of his surrogate voice. McCurry said the president often tells him to cool it.<P>

   ``I do my best,'' McCurry said with a grin.
