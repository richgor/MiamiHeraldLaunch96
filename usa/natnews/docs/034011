<m0>   CHICAGO (--) (AP) (--) If you're not huffing and puffing off enough calories in your daily workouts at the health club, try the treadmill.<ep>
   Researchers say it burned more calories than five other exercise machines studied during a test involving 13 young, fit volunteers.<ep>
   The biggest difference was between the treadmill and the stationary bicycle, with the treadmill burning more than 40 percent more calories.<ep>
   Exercising on the treadmill at a level of effort categorized as somewhat hard burned about 700 calories an hour, compared with 627 on the stair machine; 606 on the rower; 595 on the cross-country ski machine; 509 on the Airdyne, a stationary bicycle that works by pedaling with the legs and pulling on bars with the arms; and 498 on a regular stationary bike.<ep>
   The study was conducted by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and the Milwaukee VA Medical Center and reported in Wednesday's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.<ep>
