<m0>   HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (--) (AP) (--) A former high school science teacher has been sentenced to two years in prison for his role in a drug ring that investigators say had a homecoming queen murdered to silence her.<ep>
   Terry Warren, 48, also was fined $10,000. He pleaded guilty in January to aiding and abetting crack distribution.<ep>
   Five other members of the drug ring have yet to be sentenced, including his brother Robert Jerome Warren, the alleged ringleader. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Another defendant pleaded guilty to killing 17-year-old Michael Ann ``Miki'' Koontz last summer and accused Robert Warren of ordering the murder to keep her from talking to drug investigators. Koontz, a homecoming queen in the Appalachian coalfield town of Williamson, had bought drugs from the ring.<ep>
