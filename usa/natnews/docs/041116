<m0>    <m0>LITTLE ROCK<m0> (--) The judge in the Whitewater trial threw out four charges each against Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and Susan McDougal on Monday but let all 19 counts against James McDougal stand.<ep>
   The McDougals and Tucker were indicted in August on charges of fraud and conspiracy for allegedly misusing $3 million in federally backed loans. James McDougal was named in 19 counts, Tucker 11 and Susan McDougal eight.<ep>
   Among the charges the judge dismissed against Susan McDougal was a conspiracy count alleging she helped plan some of the loan transactions. Tucker was cleared of counts involving a real estate loan.<ql>
<m1>   <m0>The defense is scheduled to begin presenting its case today. Tucker still faces seven felony charges and Susan McDougal four.<ql>

in synthetic hormone<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>    <m0>WASHINGTON <m0>(--) Federal officials are moving swiftly to start new human research to see if a synthetic hormone used in popular injectable contraceptives increases the risk of AIDS virus infection. The action was prompted by monkey research that suggested the connection.<ep>
   A study at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York City demonstrated that monkeys injected with progesterone were seven times more likely to become infected when exposed vaginally to simian immune deficiency virus, or SIV.<ep>
   Progesterone is a natural hormone, but a close synthetic chemical relative, progestin, is used in two injectable contraceptives widely sold in the United States.<ep>

avert Dahmer auction<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>    <m0>MILWAUKEE <m1> <m0>(--) Disgusted at the prospect of an auction of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's ``instruments of death,'' business leaders Monday said they had raised $400,000 to keep the grisly items from public sale.<ep>
   A judge last month ordered Dahmer's assets to be liquidated and proceeds distributed to the victims' families. Lawyer Thomas Jacobson, who represents eight families, had planned an auction.<ep>
   The items had an estimated value of $100,000, but Jacobson asked for $1 million when a downtown business group, Westown Association Inc., expressed a desire to buy the whole lot and destroy it.<ql>

   The first edition, which appeared Thursday, ran 40 pages.<ql>
