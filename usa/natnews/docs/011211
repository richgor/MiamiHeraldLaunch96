   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (--) In dramatic video testimony to a hushed courtroom, President Clinton insisted Thursday he had nothing to do with a $300,000 loan at the heart of the criminal case against his former Whitewater partners.<ep>
   ``These things are simply not true,'' the president said, disputing, as he always has, the account of the prosecution's chief witness.<ep>
   It was the first time that a sitting president has testified in a criminal trial in which his own conduct has been called into question. Facing a skeptical prosecutor, Clinton said he was ``adamant'' that he never asked David Hale, the lender, to make an allegedly illegal $300,000 loan, either to replenish Whitewater's depleted bank accounts or for any other reason.<ep>
   ``Any suggestion that I tried to get any money from him or I tried to keep that a secret or I put any pressure on him, these things are simply not true,'' Clinton said. ``They didn't happen.''<ep>
   The defense abruptly rested its case after he testified.<ep>
   Clinton, a witness for the defense, was questioned in the White House on April 28 and the tape was shown to rapt jurors, some of whom took notes. He was addressed by both the prosecutor and defense attorneys as ``Mr. President.''<ep>
   The testimony thrust Clinton into a criminal case involving issues from his days as Arkansas governor that have dogged him since the 1992 political campaign.<ep>
<m0>Witness for the defense<ep>
<m0>   James McDougal and Gov. Jim Guy Tucker are being tried on charges of conspiring to defraud McDougal's savings and loan of nearly $3 million in government-backed loans in the mid-1980s, including one to McDougal's former wife, Susan. The McDougals are former business partners of Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton; Tucker is Clinton's successor in the statehouse.<ep>
   The president, who was seated in a Chippendale chair in the White House Map Room, appeared composed throughout the session. Still, he grew clearly irritated as prosecutor W. Ray Jahn grilled him on whether he had any involvement in the loan from Hale.<ep>
   At the start of his testimony, the president disputed the testimony of Hale, the chief prosecution witness, who had said Clinton pushed him to make a $300,000 loan from Hale's federally backed lending company to Susan McDougal in 1986.<ep>
   Referring to the Clintons' initial decision to invest in Whitewater, Jahn asked: ``You placed your trust and your wife placed your trust in Mr. McDougal's abilities and his integrity. Is that correct?'' asked Jahn.<ep>
   ``Yes,'' replied Clinton. ``But we also had an independent judgment about what the market would probably do. Turned out our judgment was wrong.''<ep>
   Conspiracy charges against Susan McDougal were dropped Monday, but she remains charged in four felony counts accusing her of misusing the Hale loan.<ep>
<m0>Tales of bank loans<ep>
<m0>   Clinton said he never met with Hale and McDougal to discuss arranging the loan to Susan McDougal. Hale, a former municipal judge, had testified such a meeting took place and that Clinton was to benefit from part of the loan but wanted his involvement kept secret. The money was never repaid.<ep>
   Hale, the president countered, has ``told two or three different versions of this. I've tried to keep up with these different stories.''<ep>
   From the Hale account to various events involving his Whitewater land venture, Clinton's testimony was a replay of what he has been saying for two years.<ep>
   Clinton said he never borrowed money from the McDougals' failed savings and loan and never asked anyone to borrow it on his behalf.<ep>
   Under Jahn's cross-examination, the president said he might have been involved in helping to obtain a $20,000 unsecured bank loan in 1978 that he and McDougal used as a down payment for the Whitewater venture.<ep>
   ``I might have. I had some friends who worked there. And I knew the people who owned the bank,'' Clinton said.<ep>
   Jahn asked how James McDougal helped raise funds to help Clinton retire a debt from his 1984 campaign. Jahn suggested it must have been difficult for Clinton to raise the money.<ep>
   ``Not if you are a governor who won with over 60 percent of the vote,'' Clinton shot back (--) to laughter in the courtroom.<ep>
   U.S. District Court Judge George Howard Jr. must still decide whether the Clinton videotape may be shown outside the courtroom, as requested by four television networks and two journalism groups. Clinton aides worry about the use of the tapes by political opponents.<ep>
