<m0>   DETROIT (--) (AP) (--) In one of his most brazen acts yet, Dr. Jack Kevorkian attended another suicide while on trial for two earlier deaths.<ep>
  Austin Bastable, a Canadian right-to-die activist who had multiple sclerosis, died Monday at the home of another assisted-suicide advocate, Janet K. Good, in the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills, police said Wednesday.<ep>
   The Right to Die Society of Canada said Kevorkian gave the 53-year-old Bastable the mask and carbon-monoxide canister he used to die.<ep>
   ``My death is a blow for freedom,'' Bastable said in a videotape released in Toronto, ``not just for myself but for all rational Canadians who may at some time in the future wish to decide for themselves how they may die.''<ep>
   Just hours earlier Monday, Kevorkian had testified at his assisted-suicide trial in nearby Pontiac in the 1991 deaths of two women.<ep>
   ``It's an in-your-face kind of thing,'' said Michael Modelski, a former prosecutor who dealt with Kevorkian. ``It's par for the course. He's a loose cannon.''<ep>
   It was unclear what effect Bastable's death might have on Kevorkian's third assisted-suicide trial, which was in recess until today.<ep>
   It is the 28th reported suicide Kevorkian has attended since 1990.<ep>
   In the past, Kevorkian has taken part in two suicides at once. He has left bodies in vehicles outside the coroner's office. He once assisted in a suicide the same day a judge ruled he must stand trial in an earlier death. But never before had he been present at a suicide while a trial was under way.<ep>
   Even some assisted-suicide supporters were taken aback. Among them, state Sen. Jim Berryman said he finds the retired pathologist's methods offensive.<ep>
   ``He really continues to flaunt this in the face of the Legislature,'' Berryman said. <ep>
   Circuit Judge David Breck earlier ordered the jury in Kevorkian's trial not to read or listen to news accounts of the case. If there is any indicate that they have heard the latest news and that it might influence them, they probably will be removed. Breck has four alternate jurors available; if the jury falls below 12 members, a mistrial could result.<ep>
   Kevorkian is on trial on charges of assisting in the suicides of Marjorie Wantz and Sherry Miller. They died at a cabin in a park. Wantz, 58, had severe pelvic pain and died of an injection of drugs. Miller, 43, had multiple sclerosis and died by inhaling carbon monoxide.<ep>
   Kevorkian has been acquitted in both his previous trials.<ep>
   Michael Macri, Bastable's son-in-law, told The Detroit Free Press that Bastable wanted to die in Canada but could not find any doctors there willing to help. Assisting a suicide in Canada is punishable by up to 14 years in prison.<ep>
   At the time of his death, the Windsor, Ontario, man was able to move only his head and left hand, said Ruth von Fuchs, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Right to Die Society. Bastable tried to overdose on drugs and alcohol in 1994, but his wife called 911 after finding him in a coma.<ep>
   He had created a page on the World Wide Web called Please Help Me Die With Dignity, and sent videotapes to Prime Minister Jean Chretien as part of his battle to persuade the Canadian government to allow assisted suicides.<ql>
