<m0>   William N. Copley, an American Surrealist painter of sweetly risque images of naked women and men in starchy Edwardian suits, died Tuesday in Sugar Loaf Key, Fla. He was 77. Copley led a charmed life that included not only painting, but art dealing and collecting, writing, publishing and philanthropy. He was orphaned as an infant and adopted by Ira C. Copley, a newspaper tycoon.<ql>

<m0>   Copley began painting in the late 1940s and spent most of the '50s and early '60s living in Paris.<ep>
   The style he perfected was Surrealist only in its emphasis on uninhibited expressions of the libido. His cartoonish figures, with their black staccato outlines and richly colored backgrounds, had affinities to Pop Art and drew from American folk art.<ep>
   Copley's first five marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife Cynthia; a son; two daughters; and four grandchildren.<ql>
