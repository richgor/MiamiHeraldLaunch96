   Bill Byers, a trombonist best known for his work as a musical arranger, died of cancer at his home in Malibu, Calif., on Wednesday, his 69th birthday.<ep>
   During a career in which he scored more than 100 movies, orchestrated dozens of Broadway shows and wrote arrangements for hundreds of television shows, Byers, who divided his time between New York and Los Angeles with several sojourns in Paris to break the bicoastal monotony, was in such demand that he rarely had a day to himself.<ep>
   That was partly because Byers was regarded as a versatile virtuoso, an arranger who seemed equally at home coaxing, say, a winsome mood out of a composition for a string orchestra or giving a playful edge to a jazz tune.<ep>
   Byers' list of credits includes concert and recording arrangements for such vocal giants as Tony Bennett, Bing Crosby, Billy Ekstine, Liza Minnelli, Diana Ross, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Sarah Vaughan and Andy Williams.<ep>

<m0>   After serving in the Army Air Forces during World War II, Byers toured with Benny Goodman. Byers began his television career at the age of 23 with Sid Caesar's <m0>Show of Shows  <m0>and discovered Paris, where he wrote for radio orchestras, played in jazz clubs and taught Paul Newman to play the trombone for the 1961 movie <m0>Paris Blues.<m0><ep>
   In the following years, he bounced back and forth between New York and Paris, performing with Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Quincy Jones and other jazz musicians and providing arrangements.<ep>
   In 1990, he arranged the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical <m0>City of Angels<m0>. <m2><ep>
