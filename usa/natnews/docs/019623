<m0>   <m0>(box) ``Live-scan'' <m0>systems that allow police to take an inkless fingerprint (--) they roll the suspect's digit across a glass plate and instantly check it against a computer database. Eventually, police expect to have live-scan equipment in patrol cars to provide immediate, positive identification of suspects on the street.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Patrol cars <m0>that can fire tagging devices at fleeing cars. Inside the projectiles are small radio transmitters that beam the car's location back to the pursuing officers, who can follow from a safe distance. The system gives officers an option besides engaging in a high-speed chase, which could endanger bystanders, or watching the bad guys drive off.<ep>
   <m0>(box) ``Smart guns'' <m0>that can be fired only by the owners. Sensors in the handgrip ``recognize'' the officer, allowing him or her to shoot, but no one else. Scientists <m4> BEGIN LEG #2 <m0>think smart guns could reduce the number of officers killed each year; one in seven of those slain are shot with their own weapons.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Restraining foam <m0>that traps suspects in a thick wad of sticky glue. Police officials say that the foam is effective (--) it originally was developed to immobilize potential intruders at nuclear-weapons facilities (--) but that cleanup is slow and arduous.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Devices <m0>that send out electronic pulses that burn out the electrical systems of escaping cars, forcing them to stop.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Backseat airbags <m0>that officers can use to control unruly suspects.<ep>
   <m0>(box) Personal-monitoring <m0>devices that continuously notify headquarters of an officer's exact location and transmit a full-color video of the scene via a tiny camera attached to the officer's shirt.<ep>
