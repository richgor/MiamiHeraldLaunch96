<m0>   LAS VEGAS (--) (AP) (--) The parents of a 2-year-old girl who was accidentally struck and killed by her father's truck got married at the funeral in front of the child's open casket.<ep>
   Mark Macdonald, 40, said he wanted his wedding to take place with his daughter there.<ep>
   Macdonald and Ann Scarpelli had been living together for nearly six years but never married, in part because they couldn't afford a big ceremony, Scarpelli said.<ep>
   Last Sunday, their daughter, Cherish Justine Macdonald-Scarpelli, was killed. Macdonald told police he did not realize she had wandered into an alley behind their home. No charges were filed.<ep>
   ``I suggested it would be very good for everyone concerned if the parents finally married,'' said the Rev. James Burns, who performed the wedding Thursday at a funeral home.<ep>
   The couple's 3-year-old son who served as best man at the ceremony before 25 friends and relatives. The funeral was held immediately afterward.<ep>
   Scarpelli said she was glad to have shared the wedding with both of her children.<ep>
   ``You know what they say: For every wedding there's a death. For every death a wedding,'' she said.<ep>
