<m0>   SCOTT AIR FORCE BASE, Ill. (--) (AP) (--) An Air Force sergeant was demoted and sentenced to 14 days at hard labor Friday for refusing to give a blood and saliva sample for a DNA registry designed to help identify servicemen's remains.<ep>
   Tech. Sgt. Warren Sinclair, 33, of Hampton, Va., became the third serviceman this year to be convicted at a court-martial of disobeying an order to provide such samples.<ep>
   Sinclair claimed that the requirement violated his Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. He also declared: ``It is our God-given right to maintain possession of our genes.''<ep>
   He contended that the Pentagon did not have adequate safeguards to prevent the DNA from being used for other purposes than the identification of remains. Prosecutors disputed that.<ep>
   Some experts have warned that genetic information that can indicate whether someone is susceptible to certain diseases could be used to deny people insurance or employment.<ep>
   The Pentagon began ordering genetic samples in 1993 and has more than one million samples.<ep>
   Last month in Hawaii, two Marines were convicted of refusing to give blood for the DNA registry. Cpl. John C. Mayfield III of Dallas and Cpl. Joseph Vlacovsky of Canton, Ohio, got letters of reprimand and were ordered restricted to the base for seven days.<ep>
