<m0>   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (--) (AP) (--) In dramatic video testimony to a hushed courtroom, President Clinton insisted Thursday he had nothing to do with a $300,000 loan at the heart of the criminal case against his former Whitewater partners.<ep>
   ``These things are simply not true,'' the president said, disputing, as he always has, the account of the prosecution's chief witness.<ep>
   The defense abruptly rested its case after he testified.<ep>
   Clinton, a witness for the defense, was questioned in the White House on April 28 and the tape was shown to rapt jurors, some of whom took notes. He was addressed by both the prosecutor and defense attorneys as ``Mr. President.''<ep>
   Although Clinton is not charged in the case, his videotaped appearance marked one of the few times in history that a sitting president has testified in a criminal trial.<ep>
   And it thrust Clinton into a criminal case involving issues from his days as Arkansas governor that have dogged him since the 1992 political campaign.<ep>
   James McDougal and Gov. Jim Guy Tucker are being tried on charges of conspiring to defraud McDougal's savings and loan of nearly $3 million in government-backed loans in the mid-1980s, including one to McDougal's former wife, Susan. The McDougals are former business partners of Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton; <m2><ql>

CLINTON,  FROM  1A<ql>
<m0>Tucker is Clinton's successor in the statehouse.<ep>
<m0>Witness' account disputed<ep>
<m0>   At the start of his testimony, the president disputed the testimony of David Hale, the chief prosecution witness, who had said Clinton pushed him to make a $300,000 loan from Hale's federally backed lending company to Susan McDougal in 1986.<ep>
   ``All I know is that any suggestion that I tried to get any money from him, or I tried to keep that a secret, or I put any pressure on him, these things are simply not true. They didn't happen,'' Clinton testified.<ep>
   Conspiracy charges against Susan McDougal were dropped Monday, but she remains charged in four felony counts accusing her of misusing the Hale loan.<ep>
   Clinton said he never met with Hale and McDougal to discuss arranging the loan to Susan McDougal. Hale, a former municipal judge, had testified such a meeting took place and that Clinton was to benefit from part of the loan but wanted his involvement kept secret. The money was never repaid.<ep>
   Hale, the president countered, has ``told two or three different versions of this. I've tried to keep up with these different stories.''<ep>
   The president was dressed in a dark suit and was seated as he testified. From the Hale account to various events involving his Whitewater land venture, his testimony was a replay of what he has been saying for two years.<ep>
   Clinton said he never borrowed money from the McDougals' failed savings and loan and never asked anyone to borrow it on his behalf.<ep>
<m0>Cross-examination<ep>
<m0>   Under cross-examination by prosecutor Ray Jahn, the president said he might have been involved in helping to obtain a $20,000 unsecured bank loan in 1978 that he and McDougal used as a down payment for the Whitewater venture.<ep>
   ``I might have. I had some friends who worked there. And I knew the people who owned the bank,'' Clinton said.<ep>
   During cross-examination, Jahn strayed from the central focus of the trial to examine the Clinton-McDougal relationship. How did the two couples form the Whitewater venture? How did James McDougal raise the funds to help Clinton retire a debt from his 1984 campaign?<ep>
   Jahn suggested it must have been difficult for Clinton to raise money to repay the old campaign debt.<ep>
   ``Not if you are a governor who won with over 60 percent of the vote,'' Clinton shot back (--) to laughter in the courtroom.<ep>
   U.S. District Court Judge George Howard Jr. must still decide whether the Clinton videotape may be shown outside the courtroom, as requested by four television networks and two journalism groups. Clinton aides worry about the use of the tapes by political opponents. No cameras are allowed in the courtroom.<ep>
