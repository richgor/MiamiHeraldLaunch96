   WASHINGTON -- At 10:15 a.m. Thursday, April 18, Timothy Connolly was called out of a meeting at the Defense Department by his immediate superior, H. Allen Holmes, assistant secretary of defense for special operations, and fired.<P>

   Since then an official silence has descended over the case, and speculation has swirled around the reasons for the first outright dismissal of a senior Pentagon official in the Clinton administration.<P>

   Human rights organizations, aid groups and congressional sources say Connolly was fired for being too gung-ho on banning land mines and blinding lasers, and too energetic in pushing for the Defense Department to support U.N. aid missions. His supporters in the Pentagon say he was too outspoken, and claim that the Joint Chiefs of Staff kept a file on him.<P>

   The Pentagon's press office still refers coyly to Connolly's ``departure.'' Other senior officials reject what they say is the ``canard'' that Connolly was fired because of his advocacy of a ban on land mines.<P>

   ``Connolly is a very good guy,'' said a senior defense official speaking on condition of anonymity, ``he's got a lot of talent in many ways.'' But he had to go, the official said, because ``he was unable and unwilling to accept decisions and guidance from the Defense Department.''<P>

   ``There was just not a fit between our management system in the Pentagon and his willingness to operate within that system,'' said deputy undersecretary of defense for policy Jan Lodal, who was actively involved in the decision to fire Connolly.<P>

   In an interview, Connolly, 43, said that his advocacy of land mines and laser bans may have contributed to his dismissal. A March 17 New York Times interview on land mines particularly irritated senior officials, he noted. But the fundamental cause, he said, was his unwillingness to accept ``the prevailing Pentagon view that senior uniformed officers know more about military operations than any civilian in the building.''<P>

   Most of all -- ``worst of all,'' he said -- ``I tried to change things.'' Throughout his 1992 presidential campaign, Connolly recalled, candidate Bill Clinton stressed the need for Democrats to be ``agents of change.'' A former Army Ranger with two Bronze Stars from Desert Storm and a longtime Democratic Party activist, Connolly worked in the presidential campaign for a year.<P>

   When he was appointed to the Pentagon as principal deputy assistant secretary for special operations and lowintensity conflict, Connolly said, ``I saw myself as an agent of change.''<P>

   ``If I didn't want to change anything I'd work for the Republicans,'' he said. ``They pay better.''<P>

   Now, though he is unwilling to criticize the administration directly, Connolly seems less sure about the White House's commitment to change.<P>

   ``My firing is a chilling message to other political appointees,'' he said. ``If you push too hard and need reinforcement, nobody will be coming to help.''<P>

   Connolly's supporters in the Pentagon say the decision to dismiss him came after senior officers from the Joint Chiefs of Staff took a ``file'' detailing Connolly's alleged faults and transgressions to senior Pentagon officials.<P>

   ``I have not met anyone who has seen the file,'' Connolly said, ``but I would not be surprised if it existed.''<P>

   A senior Pentagon official said he was unaware of any file and said that no file had played any role in Connolly's dismissal.<P>

   One of the few things that is clear in the Connolly affair is that it is hard for a political appointee to get dismissed from the Pentagon. No political appointees have been dismissed in this administration, a Pentagon spokeswoman said. Defense Secretary Les Aspin's resignation, after U.S. setbacks in Somalia and elsewhere, was, however, almost certainly the result of a hefty shove from the White House. And the top two officials in the National Reconnaissance Agency left their posts abruptly earlier this year after Congress discovered a $1 billion ``slush fund'' in their agency's bank.<P>

   On the other hand, when a senior Pentagon lawyer circulated a memorandum accusing two congressional staff members of espionage last year -- helpfully suggesting what statutes they could be tried under -- he did not even receive a written reprimand, though an embarrassed Pentagon repudiated the memo.<P>

   Connolly said his two-paragraph letter of dismissal stated that he had ``lost the confidence and personal trust'' of the department's senior leadership. He was told to empty his office by the weekend and be out of the Pentagon by May 11.<P>

   But after handing Connolly the letter, Holmes told him there was ``another way,'' Connolly said. Holmes would take back the dismissal letter, Connolly would tender his resignation, and he would depart in dignity. He decided not to take the quiet way out.
