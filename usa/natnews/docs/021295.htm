   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- (AP) -- A Whitewater prosecutor detailed Bill Clinton's dealings with Jim McDougal a decade ago, trying to show jurors Wednesday that McDougal has changed his story to protect the president and first lady.<P>

   McDougal told FBI agents last July that Clinton, who was then governor of Arkansas, came to McDougal in the mid-1980s and said he and his wife needed money, Whitewater prosecutor Ray Jahn said.<P>

   Jahn said similar statements were made in notes the FBI obtained from James Blair, the general counsel to Tyson Foods. Blair, a longtime Clinton friend, helped Hillary Rodham Clinton make $100,000 in the commodities market in the late 1970s on an investment of $1,000.<P>

   Testifying at his trial for the second day, McDougal called Blair a ``notorious liar'' and said FBI agents had jumbled up their account of the interview they did with McDougal last year.<P>

   McDougal said he himself initiated the offer of money for Hillary Clinton, suggesting to the governor that McDougal's savings and loan put her law firm on retainer.<P>

   Relying on meeting schedules from the governor's office, the Whitewater prosecutor pursued a grueling cross-examination of McDougal, trying to elicit an explanation of three meetings McDougal had with the governor in late 1985 and early 1986.<P>

   McDougal said he couldn't remember the purpose of the first one, that the second one might have had to do with the Whitewater real estate venture, and that the third might have concerned McDougal's complaints about state health inspectors.<P>

   All three meetings occurred about the time McDougal, Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and Municipal Judge David Hale are accused of engaging in a series of fraudulent loans from McDougal's failing S&L and Hale's government-backed lending company. McDougal, his former wife Susan and Tucker have been on trial for the past 10 weeks.<P>

   Jahn confronted McDougal with a blizzard of memos and financial documents tying him to more than $1 million in allegedly fraudulent loans.<P>

   McDougal said he had been victimized by ``admitted criminals'' such as Hale who are ``working for'' Whitewater prosecutors.<P>

   McDougal is suffering from a partially blocked artery and other health problems, and the former savings and loan owner appeared tired, addressing the jury in a low voice.<P>

   Tucker and McDougal are accused of conspiring to defraud McDougal's S&L and Hale's government-backed lending company of over $2.5 million in loans. Susan McDougal is charged in connection with a $300,000 loan that has never been repaid.
