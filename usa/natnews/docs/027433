<m0>   CLINTON, N.C. (--) (AP) (--) A.J. Bullard recognized the dogwood tree right away by its flowers and by its <m1> <m0>. . . well, bark.<ep>
   But it was not until he took a closer look that he realized that the tree (--) with a diameter of nearly three feet (--) had championship potential.<ep>
   ``I stopped and observed it closer and realized it was a monster,'' Bullard said. ``It just took my breath away.''<ep>
   Bullard, a retired dentist from Mount Olive, N.C., sent the dogwood's dimensions to the National Register of Big Trees in Washington, which certified it last August as the largest in the country. Bullard waited until spring, when the tree is in its full glory, to announce his discovery.<ep>
   The dogwood, in an old cemetery, replaced a slightly smaller tree in Norfolk, Va., as the dogwood champ (--) fitting, perhaps, because the dogwood is North Carolina's state flower.<ep>
