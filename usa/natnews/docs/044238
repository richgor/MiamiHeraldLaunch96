<m0>   CLEVELAND (--) A federal judge has ended nearly two decades of court-ordered busing, saying that state and local officials have worked to eliminate school segregation.<ep>
   U.S. Senior Circuit Judge Robert B. Krupansky said Wednesday that any segregation in the 72,000-pupil district was the result of housing patterns in Cleveland and not official policy.<ep>
   The district's compliance with the busing plan, Krupansky wrote, ``stands as an unequivocal manifestation of their good-faith efforts to desegregate the Cleveland school district.''<ep>
   The district's black enrollment has climbed to 70 percent, from 63 percent in 1978.<ep>
   Black students and parents sued the school district in 1973, charging that an official policy of segregation had left minority youngsters with second-class schools. Three years later, a judge found that the district fostered segregation and placed it under court supervision. A desegregation busing plan began in 1979.<ep>
   Krupansky's order halts busing but keeps intact other measures (--) including racial quotas for school staffs and a requirement for magnet schools to attract a diverse student body and improve student performance.<ep>
   James Hardiman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the 1973 case, said an appeal was expected.<ep>
   City and school officials applauded the ruling.<ep>
   ``We can finally begin to seriously focus on returning to neighborhood schools and allocating dollars toward education, instead of transportation,'' Mayor Michael R. White said.<ep>
   The district asked Krupansky in January 1995 to lift the racial balance requirements, saying that $10 million could be saved. The district faces a $73 million deficit and has laid off 451 teachers, effective in the fall.<ep>
   Krupansky, citing mismanagement and the rising debt, put the district under state control last year.<ep>
