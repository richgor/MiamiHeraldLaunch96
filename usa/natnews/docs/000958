<m0>   CLEVELAND (--) (AP) (--) A federal judge lifted part of a desegregation order Wednesday, ending nearly two decades of court-ordered busing in Cleveland's school system.<ep>
   U.S. Senior Circuit Judge Robert B. Krupansky found that Ohio's biggest school district had followed a plan that was supposed to achieve racial balance, largely through cross-town busing.<ep>
   James Hardiman, the lawyer for the group of black students and their parents who sued the district in 1973, said he had not seen the ruling yet. ``But it is disappointing if the court has sanctioned segregation,'' he said.<ep>
   Rick Ellis, spokesman for the 72,000-student school district, said the ruling will give the district more flexibility in assigning students to schools, beginning with the upcoming school year.<ep>
