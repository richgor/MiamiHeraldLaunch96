   After 16 years of taking terminally ill children to Disney World, a Super Bowl game or meetings with sports stars and actors, the Make-A-Wish Foundation was unprepared for what a teenager suffering from a brain tumor wanted most: to shoot a Kodiak bear in Alaska.<ep>
   But it didn't blink. It turned to Safari Club International, which collected donations including $4,000, airline tickets, a .340 Weatherby magnum rifle, binoculars, hunting clothing, an outfitter and a taxidermist.<ep>
   Now, the program that has provided thousands of families with joyful memories to help ease the depression of losing a child is on the hit list of virtually every animal-rights group in the nation.<ep>
   On Friday, the Humane Society of the United States, the world's largest animal protection group with 3 million members, asked the foundation to withdraw its offer of a guided trophy bear hunt, and to establish new guidelines barring any wish that could result in cruelty to animals.<ep>
   ``Trophy hunting inflicts needless and undeniable pain, trauma and death on animals for the sake of amusement,'' Humane Society vice president John Grandy said in a letter to the foundation.<ep>

BEAR HUNT,  FROM  1A<ql>
<m0>photograph a Kodiak bear ``would be a particularly appropriate alternative,'' he said.<ep>
   The same day, the Los Angeles animal rights group Ark Trust Inc. secured an alternative proposal for the young man and his family (--) a chance to spend a day with actor Pierce Brosnan on the Idaho set of his new $100 million James Bond film.<ep>
   And the Fund for Animals, among the nation's most aggressive anti-hunting organizations, posted ``alerts'' about the teenager's wish on the Internet and in the monthly magazine, Bunny Huggers Gazette.<ep>
   But it was all too late.<ep>
   On Friday, the Minnesota teenager Erik, whose last name is being withheld, was already stalking a bear on the Alaska peninsula with a permit donated by a German hunter, according to Don McMillan, a spokesman for the Safari Club chapter in Minnesota.<ep>
   ``With the help of 20 contributors this boy is now in Alaska taking his bear hunt,'' said McMillan, a dentist. ``We hope he gets one.''<ep>
   ``That's too bad,'' said Gretchen Wyler, president of Ark Trust, which has worked closely with the foundation over the years.<ep>
   ``It's a perverse, chilling twist on the phrase `death wish,' '' Wyler said. ``It's amazing to think that someone whose life is about to end chose to extinguish the life of a Kodiak bear, the largest land carnivore in North America.''<ep>
   ``The foundation will never be able to sustain the damage this will do to their image, especially in the Hollywood community,'' she added. ``They will rue the day they ever let the Safari Club be a partner.''<ep>
   Make-A-Wish foundation President James E. Gordon declined to be interviewed. But in a prepared statement, he said the foundation, which has helped 38,000 youngsters, ``grants wishes to children up to 18 years of age who have life-threatening illnesses. Our wishes are limited only by the child's imagination, and often reflect the activities and way of life to which the child is accustomed.<ep>
   ``The wish of a Minnesota boy to hunt Kodiak bear in Alaska has been approved by the Board of Directors of our Minnesota Chapter. It is the sincere wish of the youngster and reflects a lifelong involvement in family fishing and hunting trips.''<ep>
   Steve Wells of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, however, said hunting big brown bears in Alaska in the spring is a troubling sport because it jeopardizes females with dependent young.<ep>
   ``The problem is that sows, which are almost impossible to tell apart from males, come out of their winter dens before their cubs,'' Wells said. ``When they are shot, the cubs are orphaned.''<ep>
   For this reason, he said, ``Spring bear hunting is banned in many states. But in Alaska it remains legal and the adverse impacts of the practice are not being addressed.''<ep>
   Ron Marlenee, a lobbyist for Safari Club International and a former congressman from Montana, countered that the Alaska brown bear is the most carefully managed species in the nation.<ep>
   ``When hunters and nonhunters alike go out to see wildlife, whether it be deer, moose, Rocky Mountain elk, birds or anything else,'' he said, ``those animals are there because sportsmen put up the dollars to protect them and their habitat.''<ep>
   Humane Society spokesman Wayne Pacelle said the debate is not about ``who pays for conservation. This is about a reputable charity organization that has granted a wish that will result in cruelty to animals, and that is entirely inappropriate.''<ep>
   Wyler agreed.<ep>
   ``It's sad enough that this young man is going to die. It compounds the sadness that he wants something else to die,'' she said.<ep>
