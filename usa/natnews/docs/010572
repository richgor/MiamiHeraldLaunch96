<m0>   MARTINEZ, Calif. (--) The 6-year-old boy suspected of beating a 5-week-old baby nearly to death can be released from juvenile hall but not returned to his family, a juvenile court referee says.<ep>
   The boy will be placed in a group home (--) ``secure'' but not locked (--) as soon as one can be found that is deemed suitable by both the defense and prosecution teams, Juvenile Court Referee Stephen Easton said Wednesday.<ep>
   Easton denied a defense request that the boy be released to his mother.<ep>
   A child advocate asked that the 6-year-old, who is believed to be the youngest person in the nation charged with attempted murder, not be shackled or handcuffed during the transfer. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Among the things doctors will determine in coming weeks is whether the boy is competent to help his attorney defend him.<ep>
   The boy drew cartoon images of a courtroom sketch artist <m1>  <m0>aand a reporter Wednesday while Easton made plans for his psychiatric evaluation.<ep>
   Easton asked Dr. Herb Schreier, a child psychiatrist and chief of psychiatry at Children's Hospital in Oakland, to examine the boy and submit findings by June 5.<ep>
   The boy is accused of beating Ignacio Bermudez Jr. of Richmond, Calif., on April 22, because, prosecutors say, he did not like the way the infant's parents looked at him. The boy and 8-year-old twin boys, who have been released pending juvenile court hearings, allegedly stole a tricycle from the infant's home.<ep>
   Schreier has been asked to determine four things: whether the boy knows the difference between right and wrong, knows that assaulting people is wrong, knows the difference between life and death and is competent to cooperate with his attorney.<ep>
   John Burris, the young defendant's attorney, argued in court that the boy ``is essentially a freak among a bunch of older kids'' in Contra Costa County Juvenile Hall, and that things he says are ``off the wall.'' A long incarceration would pose long-term mental health problems for him, Burris said.<ep>
   Harold Jewett, a deputy district attorney, said public safety should be weighed with concerns for the boy, and he objected to what he said was Burris' psychoanalysis.<ep>
   Jewett said it was difficult to believe that the 6-year-old's confinement contributed to mental health deterioration.<ep>
   ``We would feel more comfortable with Dr. Schreier's examination of his mental health'' rather than Burris', Jewett said.<ep>
   During this exchange, the 6-year-old finished a drawing of sketch artist Vicki Ellen Behringer, complete with large red earrings, and proudly displayed it to her. She nodded her approval, as did the boy's mother and grandparents when he showed them his work.<ep>
   The boy paid no attention to the court proceedings.<ep>
   About 20 people, organized by the National People's Democratic Uhuru Movement, noisily protested the proceedings outside the courtroom, saying the boy is being persecuted because he is African American.<ep>
