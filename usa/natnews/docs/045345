<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) Retired Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller, a 32-year combat veteran who was deputy commander of U.S. forces in the Gulf War, died of a heart attack.<ep>
   Waller, 58, died Thursday while on a trip to Washington with his wife Marion, according to a statement released by his <m4>Waller<m2><ql>
<m0>employer, Kaiser-Hill, an environmental contractor based in Colorado.<ep>
   He had retired from the Army in 1991.<ep>
   Waller also served in Vietnam and Korea, and was one of the Army's highest-ranking blacks when he retired.<ep>
   ``America has lost a great American and a great soldier,'' said Lt. Gen. C.G. Marsh, commander of Fort Lewis in Washington state, a position once held by Waller.<ep>
   As deputy to Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, the top U.S. commander in the Gulf War, Waller was directly in charge of the main U.S. forces in the January 1991 offensive against Iraq.<ep>
   He stirred controversy before the war by arguing that U.S. troops were not ready to fight by the United Nations' deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.<m2><ql>
