<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) The body of William Colby, the former director of central intelligence, washed ashore Monday on the banks of the Maryland river where he made his second home, nine days after he set out in rough waters for a short solo canoe trip.<ep>
   Colby apparently drowned in the river he loved, the Wicomico, where it flows into the Potomac River south of Washington.<ep>
   The police said they found no evidence of foul play. Nonetheless, Colby's body was sent to Baltimore for an autopsy by the state medical examiner's office, which said that the investigation of his death was continuing.<ep>
   Colby, who was 76, left the dock of his weekend home in Rock Point, Md., late on the afternoon of April 27, paddling into a stiff wind that kicked up whitecaps. Apparently he wore no life vest.<ep>
   Scores of people (--) local crabbers and oystermen, volunteer firefighters, state officials, Navy frogmen (--) joined in the weeklong search. Colby's wife, Sally Shelton-Colby, identified his body Monday morning after the river washed it up onto land not far from where the canoe was found on the afternoon of April 28.<ep>
   Nominated as director of central intelligence by President Richard Nixon in May 1973, Colby led the nation's espionage services through two of their most turbulent years. On his watch, the CIA came under fire as never before, accused by Congress and the news media of a range of behavior that included spying on Americans and plotting to assassinate foreign leaders.<ep>
   In many cases Colby chose, in effect, to plead guilty with an explanation. Much of what is now known of the CIA's history became public because he disclosed it. For his candor and cooperation with Congress, he was dismissed by President Gerald Ford in November 1975. A future president, George Bush, succeeded him in January 1976.<ep>
   ``We may have had our disagreements,'' said one of Colby's predecessors, Richard Helms, director of central intelligence from 1966 to 1973, ``but no one would question Bill's devotion to what he conceived to be the best interests of the agency.''<ep>
   President Clinton on Monday called Colby ``a dedicated public servant'' who had ``ably led the agency through challenging times'' and ``made tough decisions when necessary.''<ep>
   The director of central intelligence, John Deutch, said that Colby had served in World War II and the cold war as an intelligence officer of ``great courage,'' and that as director he had ``faced up to severe challenges with openness and integrity.''<ep>
   Colby's widow, a top administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Development, said her husband had had ``a magnificent life'' and ``left the world a lot better and safer place than when he entered it.''<ep>
