   The date, Dec. 29, 1972, has stood like an asterisk in South Florida's aviation history.<ep>
   Never before had so many people died in a jetliner crash in South Florida. And never since that deadly day 23 1/2 years ago had the region experienced such trauma.<ep>
   Until Saturday, when a ValuJet DC-9 carrying 109 passengers and crew plunged into the Everglades, killing everyone aboard.<ep>
   The ValuJet plane went down just a few miles from the swampy site where Eastern Airlines Flight 401 from New York crashed on that Friday night, just before the new year more than two decades ago.<ep>
   The 1972 toll: 98 bodies were found in the wreckage and three more people died at area hospitals; 75 survived. The next most-deadly flight in South Florida aviation history was a crash nearly 10 years earlier in the Everglades, when a Northwest Orient plane went down in February 1963, killing 43 people.<ep>
   In 1972, Eastern's Lockheed L1011 left New York's Kennedy International Airport at 9 p.m., 20 minutes late, and was due to land at Miami International at 11:36 p.m.<ep>
   The jet was on time for landing, in its descent, landing gear apparently down. But a signal registered a problem with one of the landing gears, so the crew decided to abort the landing and circle back around.<ep>
    It turned out that the landing gear <m0>was  <m0>down, but as the crew became preoccupied with checking it out, the plane (--) accidentally knocked off autopilot (--) descended gradually, unbeknown to any of the crew.<ep>
   At 11:42 p.m., after it dropped off traffic controllers' screens, the jumbo jet bellied into the Everglades, about 19 miles northwest of the airport.<ep>
   The rescue effort began in the dark, and continued throughout the night. The conditions that rescuers faced then were similar to what people combing the ValuJet crash faced Saturday: waist-deep water, muck and dense brush.<ep>
    Unlike in the Eastern crash, rescuers Saturday failed to find anyone alive.<ql>
