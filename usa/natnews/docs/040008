<m0>    <m0>PEORIA<m0> (--) Gov. Jim Edgar's airplane was struck by lightning Wednesday and had a brief cabin fire but landed safely. No one was injured.<ep>
   ``They told us that it was probably a miracle that the tail stayed on and that we were able to land,'' Edgar said.<ep>
   The twin-engine Beechcraft King Air, with six passengers including Edgar, was flying through a storm at about 10,000 feet when it was struck about 10:35 a.m. south of Peoria, said Edgar spokesman Gary Mack.<ql>

<m0>    <m0>BOSTON<m0> (--) Managers of a Cape Cod wildlife refuge are planning to kill off thousands of their visitors with a handout of poisoned bread.<ep>
   The targets of the campaign (--) herring gulls and great black-backed gulls (--) have overrun the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge, driving away and even eating endangered shore birds.<ep>
   Despite 17 years of efforts to thin their population with harassment measures, the aggressive gulls now make up 95 percent of the island's bird population.<ep>
   Animal rights advocates say the action on Monomoy is unnecessary, arguing that the gull population has fallen dramatically since 1980.<ql>

<m0>    <m0>HOMETOWN<m0> (--) <m1> <m0>Lt. Col. Alvin Rose came home from Bosnia on Wednesday and hit the ground running on another sort of peacekeeping mission.<ep>
   Rose, a military police officer with the West Virginia National Guard, returned on a 13-day leave to stump for sheriff in Putnam County and vote in Tuesday's GOP primary.<ep>
   ``I don't want you to be seeing my name for the first time when you go to vote this fall,'' he told a lunchtime bingo game.<ep>
   Rose said he expects to be sent home from Bosnia around September, in plenty of time for the November election.<ep>

Coroner memorabilia<ql>

<m0>    <m0>LOS ANGELES<m0> (--) County supervisors agreed to license the manufacture, sale and distribution of Los Angeles County Coroner's memorabilia in Japan for the next five years.<ep>
   Japanese consumers will be able to buy personalized toe-tag key chains, like those used in the morgue, beach towels with chalk outlines of murder victims, and mugs, tote bags and T-shirts with the coroner's logo.<ep>
   Hazama International Co. Ltd. agreed to pay the county a onetime fee of $30,000 plus 9 percent of gross sales up to $500,000 to become the exclusive Japanese distributor of coroner's memorabilia. Coroner Department Director Anthony Hernandez said international media attention has increased demand for the products.<ql>
