<m0>   PHILADELPHIA (--) (AP) (--) A federal appeals court on Friday threw out a $1.3 billion asbestos settlement, saying the claims from up to 100,000 victims are so diverse they cannot be combined under one lawsuit.<ep>
   The three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also said it was unfair to impose the settlement on people who were exposed to asbestos but have not yet become ill.<ep>
   The settlement was the largest ever reached in an asbestos case and involved 20 companies.<ep>
   ``It was a great unfairness,'' said attorney Howell Rosenberg, who represented one of the groups appealing the settlement. ``It bound future people, people who never realized they were exposed to disease. It was anything but a panacea for the court system.''<ep>
   In its 69-page ruling, the appeals court canceled the settlement and returned the case to the district court. The court also cleared the way for plaintiffs who had joined the settlement to file individual lawsuits.<ep>
   ``Each individual plaintiff's claim raises radically different factual and legal issues from those of other plaintiffs,'' Judge Edward R. Becker wrote. ``These differences . . . eclipse any common issues in this case.''<ep>
   The agreement would have cut legal costs, which far exceed payments to victims pursuing individual claims.<ep>
      Asbestos has been found to cause a wide range of severe and sometimes fatal respiratory problems.<ep>
