   NEW YORK (--) William S. Brennen, a deputy bank superintendent for Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and a top aide to Mayors Abraham Beame and Edward Koch, died Wednesday. He was 72.<ep>
   Brennen backed Rockefeller's run for governor in 1958, and the governor rewarded him by naming him First Deputy Superintendent of Banks.<ep>
   In 1963, Brennen was named a senior vice president of Greenwich Savings Bank. He became its president in 1969 and chairman in 1971.<ep>
   Beame asked Brennen to set up the New York City Industrial Development Agency, and he served as its volunteer chairman for 12 years, overseeing $500 million in loans to city businesses.<ep>
   In 1983, Koch asked Brennen to overhaul the city's economic development agencies and he served as commissioners over two separate agencies, Business Development and International Business Development.<ep>
   He left the city in 1986 to practice law. At the time of his death, Brennen was a partner in the law firm of Brennen & Stack.<ql>
