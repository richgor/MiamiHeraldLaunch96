   LOS ANGELES -- As he fights for his political survival, Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti sometimes envisions his epitaph after a lifetime devoted to public safety: The Man Who Lost the O.J. Simpson Murder Case.<P>

   ``My God, am I going to be defined by this case forever?'' an exasperated Garcetti asked in an interview, as he reflected on his rejection by nearly two-thirds of the voters in March's primary race <BR>
against five challengers. The primary forced Garcetti into a November runoff with one of his deputies, John Lynch, and pundits here say Garcetti could lose.<P>

   Garcetti may not be defined by the Simpson case forever, political analysts say, but certainly until Election Day on Nov. 5, which will occur against the backdrop of yet another O.J. Simpson case: a wrongful-death civil suit against the ex-football star by the families of his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald L. Goldman. Simpson was acquitted of their murders last October after a sensational nine-month criminal trial that many legal experts said Garcetti's office botched.<P>

   The harsh realization that the ``Trial of the Century'' may end up bearing more on Garcetti's reelectability than the thousands of other cases his office has handled and the many public safety programs he has pushed is a source of immense frustration for Los Angeles County's 54-year-old district attorney.<P>

   After all, he is known as an astute politician with a flair for attracting publicity. But in this instance, he admits he has failed to communicate the most important message of his 27-year prosecutorial career: that he is more than the district attorney on whose watch the Simpson case was lost; that his office has a 92 percent conviction rate in lesser-known criminal trials; and that as a result, Los Angeles County's violent crime rate ranks 46th among the nation's 50 largest metropolitan areas.<P>

    Despite his office's record of success in criminal cases, the nonpartisan primary campaign was dominated by criticism that Garcetti's deputies failed to win convictions in a string of high-profile trials, including the Menendez brothers' first murder trial, rapper Snoop Doggy Dog's murder trial and, most important of all, the marathon Simpson trial. In a town where celebrities and their lifestyles are so much a part of the culture, losing such cases can break a district attorney's career.<P>

   Although Eric and Lyle Menendez were convicted of murdering their parents in a retrial just before the primary election, Garcetti could not even make political capital of that victory because of a gag order imposed by the judge pending a capital punishment hearing.<P>

   Garcetti's runoff opponent, Lynch, was a virtual unknown in politics before he won 21 percent of the primary vote on a shoestring $60,000 campaign budget. In addition to hammering Garcetti on the high-profile cases, Lynch campaigned on a vow to depoliticize the District Attorney's Office and keep a much lower public profile than Garcetti.<P>

   But it was the acquittal of Simpson and the public anger that flowed from it -- particularly among the predominantly white, older and conservative voters who turned out for the election -- that may have been most responsible for Garcetti winning only 37 percent of the vote and forced him into a runoff with Lynch.<P>

   Much of the criticism of Garcetti, particularly among white voters, has centered on his decision to rely on the testimony of former police detective Mark Fuhrman, whose history of racist attitudes helped define the trial along racial lines, and on his decision to hold the trial downtown, where a mostly black jury was a certainty, instead of in Santa Monica, where Simpson most likely would have had a predominantly white jury. The slayings occurred in Brentwood, which normally would mean a trial in Santa Monica, except that high-profile cases usually are held in the larger downtown Criminal Courts Building.<P>

   But Garcetti is no stranger to high-profile criminal trials and the minefields they present to a district attorney. In his first four years in office, in addition to the Menendez, Snoop Doggy Dog and Simpson cases, he has managed cases involving pop singer Michael Jackson, baseball players Darryl Strawberry and Vince Coleman, and ``Hollywood Madam'' Heidi Fleiss, among other celebrities.<P>

   ``I mean, I've been in the D.A.'s Office for over 27 years and there has never been a run of high-profile cases like during this four-year period,'' Garcetti said.
