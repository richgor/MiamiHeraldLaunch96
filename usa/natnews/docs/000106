<m0>Montana, <m0>Patsy, 87, a country music pioneer known best for her 1935 hit <m0>I Want to be a Cowboy's Sweetheart,<m0> of heart failure in Nashville. Montana's Western-theme songs created a yodeling cowgirl image that helped elevate women in country music to prominent, if not equal, standing with male singers. She was often said to be the first female country singer to sell one million records.<ep>
<m0>Revueltas, <m0>Rosaura, the Mexican actress who starred in the politically inflammatory film <m0>Salt of the Earth,<m0> at her home in Cuernavaca, just south of Mexico City. The official Notimex news agency gave her age as 76, but the Reforma newspaper said she was 85 and often lied about her age. In<m0> Salt of the Earth<m0>  (1953), Revueltas played the starring role of Esperanza Quintero, the wife of a Mexican-American zinc worker who becomes involved in the struggle for workers' and women's rights during a violent strike in New Mexico.<ep>
<m0>Schmidt, <m0>Charles E., 83, a floor sweeper at a Chicago brokerage house who went on to found a national farm supply chain and become a financier, of a heart attack in Boca Raton. Schmidt began his career as a sweeper at Shields & Co., a Chicago brokerage house.<ep>
<m0>Wallenda, <m0>Angel, 28, a member of the Flying Wallendas who continued to walk the high wire despite losing a leg to cancer. In 1987, she was diagnosed with bone cancer, and her right leg was amputated just below the knee. But she relearned to walk the wire, inching along on her one good leg and an artificial limb. Her former husband Steven and their 9-year-old son, Steve Wallenda II, are the last direct descendants of modern-day patriarch ``Karl the Great,'' who fell to his death in 1978 from a cable strung between two hotels in Puerto Rico.<ql>
