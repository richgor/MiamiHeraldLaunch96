<m0>   OMAHA, Neb. (--) People in conservative Nebraska love Gov. Ben Nelson, a Democrat in a state where Republicans are in the majority.<ep>
   Less than a year into his second four-year term as governor, Nelson is running for the Democratic Senate nomination in Tuesday's primary. And not even a GOP charge that he broke a campaign pledge to serve out his second term as governor is sticking.<ep>
   ``It doesn't sound like a serious accusation to me,'' said Mary Daake, who teaches political science at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. ``My sense is it probably won't hurt him badly.''<ep>
   Nelson, 54, entered the race when Democratic Sen. Jim Exon decided to retire after three terms. Nelson is unopposed in his primary.<ep>
   The Republican candidates are Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg and Omaha investment banker Chuck Hagel. Stenberg, 47, and Hagel, 49, are running even in surveys of GOP voters.<ep>
   Nelson, Stenberg and Hagel have similar views: They are opposed to abortion and favor lower taxes and a crackdown on crime.<ep>
   All three have been endorsed by an anti-abortion group. Nelson and Stenberg have the backing of the National Rifle Association.<ep>
   ``Nelson appears to be positioning himself as being almost more conservative than the Republican candidates,'' Daake said.<ep>
   More than two-thirds of the Republicans surveyed in a Gallup Poll earlier this year rated Nelson favorably. The same poll gave him significant advantages over both Republican Senate hopefuls.<ep>
   State GOP chairman Chuck Sigerson contends, however, that the governor has nothing to show for his first term in office.<ep>
   ``If you have a good smile and a strong handshake, you'll find a lot of people like you,'' Sigerson said.<ep>
   In the 1990 gubernatorial primary, Nelson won the nomination by just 42 votes. Nelson squeaked by Republican Gov. Kay Orr in 1990 but buried GOP challenger Gene Spence in 1994, winning 74 percent of the vote.<ep>
   Nelson said his narrow margin of victory in the 1990 primary was a ``defining experience.''<ep>
   ``It probably more than anything else has driven home to me the importance of every person's vote,'' he said. ``Don't ever think your vote doesn't count.''<ep>
   A former insurance lawyer, Nelson is well-liked for helping to bring in the Nebraska lottery and multi-state Powerball lottery, and for opposing a five-state radioactive waste dump proposed for Boyd County in northeastern Nebraska.<ep>
   Several of Nelson's anti-crime proposals have been enacted by the Legislature at a time of growing anxiety about crime.<ep>
   But the governor also has angered voters, in one case telling citizens upset over property taxes not to expect the state to bail them out with more money.<ep>
   Adam Branting, deputy director of the state Democratic Party, said the governor benefits from the legacy of another Nebraska Democrat: William Jennings Bryan, the 1896 Democratic presidential nominee.<ep>
   A century ago, Bryan electrified the nominating convention with his populist ``Cross of Gold'' speech lashing out at wealthy Northeast industrialists who favored a gold standard. Ever since, Nebraska Democrats have been cast in the same mold, Branting said.<ep>
   ``There is a strong prairie populist streak to them,'' he said. ``It's not about some vague philosophy coming out of the East Coast. It's centered here, centered along the Platte River.''<ep>
   Neither President Clinton nor Republican Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas has expended much effort for Nebraska's five electoral votes. In presidential contests, Nebraska almost always favors Republicans, and Dole is expected to do well.<ep>
   But even though Republicans hold the edge in registered voters, outnumbering Democrats by about 90,000, the race is seen as Nelson's to lose. Democrats have controlled the seat since Exon was first elected in 1978.<ep>
