   BEAVER, Okla. (--) In a region where a few inches of rain can separate success and failure, farmers and ranchers are facing a disastrous drought that could cost many their land and livelihood.<ep>
   Since October, the three-county Oklahoma Panhandle, along with nearby Harper and Ellis counties, has received an average rainfall of 2.32 inches, the second driest such period since 1895, according to the Oklahoma Climatological Survey.<ep>
   The drought has stunted the winter wheat crop and the pasture ranchers such as Guy Payne depend on, forcing them to sell breeding stock they can no longer afford to feed.<ep>
   ``I'm selling part of my factory, you could say,'' Payne, 42, said Wednesday over bacon and eggs in the cafe at the Beaver City Stockyards, where spurs jingle as cattlemen walk and $100,000 deals are still sealed with a handshake.<ep>
   Cows sold for slaughter in the current buyers' market earn far less money than they would bearing calves over the next four to six years, Payne said.<ep>
   ``It's going to put me in a very vulnerable situation. I just hope I'm going to be here in a couple of years,'' Payne said. ``You can either survive a drought or a wreck in the cattle business, but the two together is really tough.''<ep>
   Otis Meredith, who ranches and grows wheat just over the border in Kansas, brought eight calves and three cows to the stockyards on Wednesday.<ep>
   ``If it don't rain, there's going to be a bunch more,'' Meredith told Bill Skaggs, the stockyard's owner.<ep>
   Skaggs surveys the stock with an expert's eye, pointing out the drought's toll (--) calves that should weigh 500 pounds or more weigh in at less than 400 pounds. He gestures at Meredith as the rancher pulls his trailer away from the loading chute.<ep>
   ``This guy will be all right. But there's lots of these young people that owe against land. They're not going to be here next year,'' Skaggs said. Skaggs estimates that 50 percent or more of the area's ranchers may be in financial difficulty because of the drought.<ep>
   On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture designated the state a primary disaster area because of severe drought conditions, making operators of family-size farms and ranches eligible for low-interest, emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency.<ep>
   Skaggs and others liken the current dry spell to historic droughts dating back to the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.<ep>
   ``This is the worst I've ever seen,'' said Alex Barton, 84, who has ranched near Booker, Texas, all his life. The drought is worsened by the high price of hay and grain, which makes feeding cattle into the spring and summer impractical.<ep>
   Rainfall levels are down all over Oklahoma, said Howard Johnson, the assistant state climatologist for the Oklahoma Climatological Survey. While the drought does not yet compare to the seven-year dry spell of the 1950s, its timing in the normally wet spring months is particularly bad for agriculture.<ep>
   ``Everybody who uses water has a different definition of drought,'' Johnson said. ``Certainly if you're a wheat farmer, this is a very serious drought.''<ep>
   The drought's most dramatic effects begin to show the farther west you go. Winter wheat that should be waist-high barely comes up to the top of a farmer's boots. And pasture land that should be lush and green with spring grasses looks brown and barren.<ep>
   ``The grass, well it just looks like a dead winter,'' said Clinton Haskell, 68, who farms and ranches near Beaver. Haskell and Sid Patzkowsky, 63, sipped coffee and talked at Kelly's Motel Cafe in Beaver.<ep>
   ``This could compare to the '50s,'' Patzkowsky said, recalling the historic drought. ``We'll have a late harvest if we cut at all.''<ep>
   The climatologist and the farmers and ranchers agree that rain must come soon if this year is to be saved before heat permanently stunts the pasture grass and the winter wheat.<ep>
   ``This is the period in the next two weeks that we have to have rain,'' Johnson said.<ep>
   A chance of showers and thunderstorms is in the forecast for the weekend.<ep>
   Many farmers around the area are plowing under their winter wheat, hoping to start over with feed grain or another fall crop, but continued lack of rainfall could dash those hopes.<ep>
   Haskell and Patzkowsky, long established farmers, say they can weather a hard year, the price of farming an arid landscape where rainfall averages about 20 inches per year.<ep>
   ``Its worse than going to Reno by far,'' Haskell said of the risky nature of farming the Panhandle.<ep>
   But they worry about younger families who owe money on land, cattle or equipment.<ep>
   ``With the cattle prices and the dry weather, you're going to see some people go under,'' Haskell said.<ep>
   As he waits for the cattle sale to begin, Payne worries that he might become one of those casualties. A third-generation rancher, Payne works land that has been in his wife's family for 100 years.<ep>
   ``I'd hate to be the one to lose it, but it could very well happen,'' Payne said.<ep>
