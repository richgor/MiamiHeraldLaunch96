   LOS ANGELES -- Nearly a month after a television news crew here videotaped the clubbing of two Mexicans by sheriff's deputies, the incident continues to transfix Californians, generating extraordinary soul-searching over the issue of illegal immigration.<P>

   Many people were pained by the videotape, released within hours of the beating and played with numbing repetition on the local news. The grainy images stirred a range of feelings including embarrassment, anger, sadness and horror as the officers used nightsticks on the unresisting Mexicans, a man and a woman, both illegal immigrants.<P>

   But although polls show that a majority of people believe the deputies used excessive force, a vocal and politically influential minority has directed their outrage instead at the people who were beaten. They have argued loudly, on talk radio, in sound bites on the nightly news and in newspaper opinion columns, that people who sneak into this country illegally, take American jobs and burden social services deserve what they get.<BR>
Force called inevitable<BR>
<P>

   ``When you are engaged in a felony, some force is likely to be used,'' said Ron Prince, the chairman of Save Our State, an organization that wants a crackdown on illegal immigration. ``If our borders were secure, we wouldn't have these kind of incidents.''<P>

   Joseph Perkins, a conservative columnist for The San Diego Union-Tribune, wrote recently that while no reasonable person would condone the beatings, it was not unreasonable to suggest that any fleeing felon of any race or nationality who leads the police on an hourlong chase at speeds up to 75 miles an hour is not going to be treated with kid gloves once apprehended.<P>

   Even some civil libertarians with strong liberal credentials have found it hard to defend the illegal immigrants. While deploring the beatings, some say privately that they were appalled by the decision of lawyers for one of the Mexicans to file a lawsuit against Riverside County, alleging that the deputies ``recklessly, intentionally and wantonly'' violated their client's civil and human rights and seeking $10 million in damages. The Mexicans should not receive a huge monetary windfall, critics complained, because they were breaking the law.<BR>
Like winning the lottery<BR>
<P>

   Joel Kopkin, a senior fellow for public policy at Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif., said: ``A lot of people feel that what the cops did was wrong, and they should be punished for it. But should the felons be rewarded for the fact that the police did something wrong? It's like these people have won the lottery.''<P>

   The beatings occurred on April 1, after a high-speed chase over 80 miles of Southern California highways, ending about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The two victims, Alicia Sotero and Enrique Funes Flores, were among about 20 illegal immigrants packed in a pickup truck. The others fled after the truck was stopped by the deputies.<P>

   The two officers involved, Kurt Franklin and Tracy Watson, have been suspended with pay pending an investigation by the Justice Department and other law enforcement agencies.<P>

   A decision on whether to indict the officers could come in the next two weeks, said a person close to the investigation.<P>

   Some critics have found it galling that Mexico, through its consul in Los Angeles, Jose Angel Pescador, encouraged the beating victims to sue for damages. Foreign Ministry officials in Mexico City have also said that Pescador was in contact with several Mexican American and Hispanic grass-roots organizations to encourage their protests to the Clinton administration and in the streets.<P>

   ``Mexico Hypocrisy,'' thundered an editorial in The Fresno Bee, which went on to say that Mexican officials, given their own dismal human rights record, had little standing to preach human rights to the United States.<BR>
Rally in Riverside<BR>
<P>

   Sentiments against the victims were defiantly displayed at a rally in the city of Riverside two weeks after the incident, where speakers bashed immigrants and the news media.<P>

   Daryl Gates, the former chief of the Los Angeles Police Department and the featured speaker, told the crowd of about 500 that he was still angry that, after the acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers on state charges in connection with the beating of Rodney G. King in 1991, federal authorities successfully prosecuted two of them on civil rights violations.<P>

   Gates urged the federal government to stay out of the Riverside case.
