   Patsy Montana, whose yodeling cowgirl songs made her a pioneer in country music, died Friday in San Jacinto, Calif. She was 81.<P>

   She had her biggest hit, I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart,  in 1935, the first million-selling hit for a female country singer. It brought an assertive female voice to country music, as she announced her readiness to ``rope and ride'' and sang whooping high notes.<P>

   Montana, whose original name was Rubye Blevins, was born in Hot Springs, Ark., and grew up in Hope, Ark., hearing the music of Jimmie Rodgers, country's ``blue yodeler.''<P>

   She joined the revue of a country singer, Stuart Hamblen, in 1931, working with a group called the Montana Cowgirls. Hamblen renamed her Patsy.<P>

   She made her first recordings as Patsy Montana in 1932, and in 1933 she moved to Chicago to perform on radio with the Prairie Ramblers. She appeared regularly on the National Barn Dance  program and recorded for American Record Corp., usually accompanied by the Ramblers. She moved with them to WOR radio in Manhattan in 1935.<P>

   Along with I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart,  which she wrote, her hits included Shy Anne from Old Cheyenne,  The She Buckaroo,  Rodeo Sweetheart  and I Wanna Be a Western Cowgirl.  In 1939, she appeared with Gene Autry in the movie Colorado Sunset. <P>

   During the 1940s, she recorded with the Sons of the Pioneers and the Light Crust Doughboys, and had a hit with Goodnight, Soldier  during World War II.<P>

   In 1964, she made an album with a band that included Waylon Jennings, little known at the time, on lead guitar. In the 1970s and '80s, she made albums for folk and bluegrass labels like Birch, Old Homestead and Flying Fish.<P>

   She is survived by her husband, a daughter and two brothers.
