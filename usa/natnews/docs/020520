<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) Millions of men who suffer from enlarged prostate now can choose a one-hour treatment over drugs or surgery: a machine that literally microwaves the prostate to relieve urinary symptoms.<ep>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the Prostatron, which kills excess prostate tissue by heating the gland with microwaves, based on studies showing it may help 75 percent of patients.<ep>
   ``While not a cure, it effectively treats the symptoms'' of enlarged prostates, FDA Commissioner David Kessler said Monday.<ep>
   The Prostatron is a one-hour, outpatient procedure that appears to work better than drugs and clearly is safer than surgery, said Dr. John Lynch, urology chief at Georgetown University Medical Center.<ep>
   ``It's not 100 percent'' effective, Lynch said, but ``it is going to appeal to a broad spectrum of men . . . who have troublesome symptoms of this disease.''<ep>
   The prostate is a walnut-size gland that surrounds the urethra, which carries urine to the penis. Prostates enlarge as men age, squeezing the urethra and making it difficult to urinate. More than half of all men over age 60 have the problem, called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH (--) and 80 percent of men get it by age 80.<ep>
   Surgery to trim the prostate is the most common and most effective treatment. But the $8,000 to $12,000 operation usually requires up to three days in the hospital and can cause such complications as impotence or incontinence.<ep>
   There are two drugs approved to shrink the prostate or relax its hold, but they offer only modest relief and cost hundreds of dollars a year.<ep>
   The Prostatron, performed under local anesthetic, treats most symptoms successfully, with no significant effect on sexual function, the FDA said.<ep>
   Manufacturer EDAP Technomed Inc. said the treatment is available immediately at hospitals that tested it: Georgetown, Rush Presbyterian Hospital in Chicago, Kidney Stone Center in Denver and the Mayo Clinics in Rochester, Minn. and Jacksonville. The Prostatron went on sale to other hospitals Monday.<ep>
