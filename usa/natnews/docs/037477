<m0>  NEW YORK (--) Jack Weston, the chubby, jowly actor who elevated anguish to a comic art in a 40-year career on television, in the movies and on Broadway, has died. He was 71.<ep>
   Weston died Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He had lymphoma for <m4>Weston<m2><ql>
<m0>six years, his wife said.<ep>
   Weston appeared in hundreds of television productions, two dozen movies and another two dozen Broadway plays.<ep>
   Woody Allen hired Weston for his acclaimed role as a sleazy personal manager in <m0>The Floating Lightbulb,<m0> which led to a Tony nomination for Weston in 1981.<ep>
   One of his more acclaimed roles was in <m0>The Four Seasons,<m0> the 1981 movie with Alan Alda, Carol Burnett and Rita Moreno that led to a spinoff television series starring Weston in 1984.<ep>
   His Hollywood years began on a whim in the spring of 1958 when he and his first wife, Marjorie Redmond, abruptly quit their parts in the Broadway hit <m0>Bells Are Ringing<m0>  and struck out for Los Angeles in a vintage Volkswagen, expecting to return to New York in the fall.<ep>
   But it turned out to be an 18-year stay as Weston appeared almost constantly on television. And his wife did even better: a 10-year stint as the Cool Whip lady.<ep>
   In much of his early work, Weston was the villain, most memorably as a man who terrorizes Audrey Hepburn in the 1967 cult classic <m0>Wait Until Dark.<m0><ql>
