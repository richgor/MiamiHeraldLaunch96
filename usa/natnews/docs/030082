<m0>   CHICAGO (--) (AP) (--) If you're not huffing and puffing off enough calories in your daily workouts at the health club, try the treadmill.<ep>
   Researchers say it burned more calories than five other exercise machines studied during a test involving 13 young, fit volunteers.<ep>
   The biggest difference was between the treadmill and the stationary bicycle, with the treadmill burning more than 40 percent more calories.<ep>
   Exercising on the treadmill at a level of effort categorized as somewhat hard burned about 700 calories an hour, compared with 627 on the stair machine; 606 on the rower; 595 on the cross-country ski machine; 509 on the Airdyne, a stationary bicycle that works by pedaling with the legs and pulling on bars with the arms; and 498 on a regular stationary bike.<ql>

<m0>   Dr. Pietro Tonino, chief of sports medicine for Loyola University Medical Center, said the study shows that people don't need to spend lots of money to exercise.<ep>
   ``It shows the benefit of going out and simply walking,'' he said.<ep>
