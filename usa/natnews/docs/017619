<m0>   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (--) (AP) (--) Seizing an issue that was once a Republican domain, President Clinton said Friday that ``we desperately need more citizen involvement'' to remedy America's problems with crime, teen pregnancy and welfare.<ep>
   In a commencement address to Pennsylvania State University's graduate school, Clinton said there's been such a buildup of violence and gangs and drugs that ``we've almost become numb to it. A lot of us may even be resigned to it.''<ep>
   But he said Americans should ``refuse to accept this as a normal and unavoidable and irreversible condition. I believe we can mend our social fabric.''<ep>
   He urged every middle school and high school to make public service part of its curriculum and said colleges should use federal funds to orient work-study toward community service. He said the government would match community grants (--) up to $500 (--) to reward high school students who do significant work for their communities.<ep>
   ``We have to find ways to build strong communities and we have got to find ways to get more personal responsibility from all our citizens,'' Clinton said.<ep>
   The speech was the first in a series of at least three commencement addresses billed by the White House as presenting Clinton's vision and agenda for a second term. The president will speak on America's global leadership at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., on May 22, and on economic issues June 4 at Princeton University in New Jersey.<ep>
   Under Clinton's plan for high school students, the government would match each dollar raised by communities, schools, businesses and civic groups up to $500. The money would come from the $150 million increase requested for the president's national service program.<ep>
