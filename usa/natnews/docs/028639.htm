   WASHINGTON -- The House voted Thursday to overhaul U.S. public-housing programs by giving local authorities more latitude to raise rents, oust troublemakers and attract more working people to serve as role models.<P>

   The five-year, $65.5 billion bill, approved on a 315-107 vote, would substantially reduce the federal government's financing of public housing. By the turn of the century, federal spending for public housing would be about 60 percent less than what it might have been under the law in 1995.<P>

   Although the bill incorporates many of the reforms already put in place by the Clinton administration, it also contains several provisions the president opposes. The administration said the president does not support the bill in its current form.<P>

   One of the controversial provisions would raise the income threshold in determining eligibility for space in public housing. The average income now ranges between $6,420 and $6,900. Under the House-passed bill, critics complained, some families earning up to $40,000 theoretically would be eligible.<P>

   Another controversial provision would eliminate existing rules that set aside up to 85 percent of public-housing units for the poorest tenants, lowering the set-asides to 35 percent.<P>

   Sponsors said this would draw in more working families that could serve as role models and encourage more diversity in project populations. Critics, including the Clinton administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development, say many near-destitute people could be precluded from decent housing.<P>

   The Senate earlier passed its own version of the bill, which differs in key respects from the House measure and is much closer to what the administration wants. HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros expressed the hope Thursday that Senate negotiators would prevail in a House-Senate conference to reconcile the differences.<P>

   ``The House was right to make permanent the Clinton public-housing reforms,'' the secretary said, ``but wrong to allow rents to be raised on the working poor and to deny scarce federal housing aid to families most in need.''<P>

   A major change in the House bill would transform the 3,400 existing public-housing authorities around the nation into new Local Management Housing Authorities (LMHAs) with far greater flexibility in managing local public-housing facilities, tailoring the projects to local needs.<P>

   New 12-member boards, which would have to include at least two recipients of public-housing aid, would set broad policy for each local housing authority and monitor its compliance with the policy. Each authority would have a free hand to set rents for tenants and control the income mix of renters.<P>

   That provision sparked a raucous debate between Republican sponsors of the bill and opponents, in both parties, over whether some low-income families would be priced out of some rentals and made homeless.<P>

   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., the chief sponsor, insisted that ``the most vulnerable tenants,'' the elderly, disabled and very poor, would be shielded from unreasonable rent hikes. But he also argued that housing-authority managers needed more room to raise rents for other tenants to earn enough revenue to maintain the properties.<P>

   Opponents argued that higher rents could drive many lowincome working families from the projects and leave them with few other housing choices.<P>

   Opponents tried and failed to retain an existing provision, named after former Sen. Edward Brooke, R-Mass., that restricts housing agencies from charging rents higher than 30 percent of a tenant's monthly income.<P>

   ``A rent ceiling doesn't hurt the working poor, it helps them by establishing a safeguard against escalating rents beyond their ability to pay,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn.<P>

   But Lazio contended that ``income-based rent is a disincentive for tenants to work and improve their incomes because, as their incomes rise, so does their rent.''<P>

   Noting that the bill calls for a declining level of federal support for public housing, Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., said the combination of shrinking federal aid and the exemption from higher rents for the aged and disabled would force local housing authorities to boost the rent for working tenants.<P>

   ``Mr. Lazio,'' he said, ``your bill would hurt the very tenants you purport to want to help -- the working poor.''
