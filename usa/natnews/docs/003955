<m0>   Don McNeill, the cheerful host who welcomed millions of radio listeners across the United States and Canada to a new day for more than 35 years as host of <m0>Don McNeill's Breakfast Club,<m0> died Tuesday in Evanston, Ill. He was 88.<ep>
   Five times a week, from June 23, 1933, until Dec. 27, 1968, he presided over a show that mixed corny <m4>McNeill<m2><ql>
<m0>humor with interviews, songs, guests, the Moment of Silent Prayer, skits with the gossipy Aunt Fanny, Memory Time and the March Around the Breakfast Table. The show's four 15-minute segments were divided into ``calls to breakfast.''<ep>
   ``Good morning, Breakfast Clubbers,'' McNeill would say to listeners to more than 300 stations from coast to coast during the program's heyday in the 1940s. <m1> <ep>
<m0>   Sam Cowling, a comic fixture on the show, would deliver ``Fact and Fiction From Sam's Almanac.'' Sample: ``The distance from the head of a fox to its tail is a fur piece.''<ep>
 ``Of course we're corny,'' McNeill said in an interview. ``And why not? Probably most American wit and humor could be called that. As for sentiment, nobody should be ashamed of it. There are too many poker faces in the world today.''<ep>
   The talent included Patti Page, Johnny Desmond and Toots & Chickie, the act that later became Fibber McGee and Molly.<ep>
  McNeill was born in Galena, Ill., and graduated from Marquette with a bachelor's degree in philosophy. <m0><ep>
   <m0>After the show went off the air, he taught communication arts classes at Marquette and Notre Dame and represented the Deltona Corporation Florida land developers. <ep>
   He is survived by three sons, a sister, eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.<ql>
