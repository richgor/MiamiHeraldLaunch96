<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) Gallaudet University for the deaf hailed Sen. Bob Dole on Friday for a sensitivity (--) born of his own experience (--) to the needs of disabled people. But he decided not to talk about that experience.<ep>
   The Republican presidential candidate was honored at Gallaudet's commencement for supporting ``every major piece of disability legislation'' since coming to the Senate nearly three decades ago.<ep>
   Dole ``has turned his own experience with disability into a better life for other people with disabilities,'' board chairman Glenn Anderson said in conferring an honorary degree on the Senate majority leader.<ep>
   But Dole, who suffered a war injury that damaged his right side and crimped his hand, made no reference to his or his audience's disabilities in a brief speech urging graduates ``to stand up for what is right.''<ep>
   He shelved a prepared speech that spoke about how he had been tested by his injury and how the students would be tested, too. The speech also mentioned technological advances allowing deaf people ``full participation (--) on their own terms.''<ep>
   Later, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a senior adviser to the Dole campaign and a member of the school's board, said Dole is ``a very private man'' who does not easily speak of personal challenges.<ep>
   ``He doesn't like to talk about those things except in terms of his entire life experience,'' McCain said. ``I think he's prouder of what he's done than what, very frankly, he's been through.''<ep>
   Dole was warmly received by the class of 380 graduates, their families and friends at the country's only four-year liberal arts college for the deaf and hearing impaired.<ep>
