<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) Postage due may be done.<ep>
   The Postal Service is considering ending the practice of delivering underpaid mail ``postage due.'' Instead, mail with insufficient postage would be returned to sender, just like mail with no postage at all.<ep>
   Currently, while mail with no postage is sent back, items with postage (--) but not enough (--) are marked ``postage due'' and sent to the intended recipient. The letter carrier then tries to collect the shortage.<ep>
   America's shifting society is a major reason the change may be needed, postal officials say.<ep>
   Letter carriers are often unable to find someone at home to pay for postage due during normal business hours, the agency said.<ep>
   In addition, more and more mail is being delivered to boxes grouped in apartment lobbies or clustered at the end of streets.<ep>
   Angelo Wider, manager of revenue assurance for the post office, says the change could be benefit for everyone. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Short-paid items can be returned right away for more postage rather than being delayed by an attempt to collect from the recipient. That time saving may be important in the case of bill payments, he said.<ep>
