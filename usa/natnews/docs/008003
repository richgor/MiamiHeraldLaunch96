<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) Postal inspectors took over a child pornography business to crack down on what they said was the largest known commercial distributor of such material in the United States.<ep>
   Forty-five people have been charged and as many as 70 more arrests are expected as the two-year undercover investigation winds down. Authorities said children as young as 7 were involved.<ep>
   Several of those investigated for receiving pornography were also charged with child sex abuse after investigators found evidence during searches of their homes, postal inspectors said.<ep>
   Ray Leslie Opfer of Reno, Nev., was sentenced to life in prison for the molestation of two brothers (--) ages 9 and 12 (--) after inspectors discovered a collection of sexually explicit videos of neighborhood children in his home, Postal Inspector Ray Smith reported.<ep>
   ``We hope it makes a difference. But we're not naive enough to think it will cause making child pornography or trafficking in it to end,'' Chief Postal Inspector Kenneth J. Hunter said Friday.<ep>
   Hunter said his office makes as many as 200 arrests a year ``in this vile trade.''<ep>
   The probe began, Hunter said, when his agency received complaints that a San Diego company called Overseas Mail was sending out catalogs offering child pornography.<ep>
   One operator, James Leroy Kemmish, was arrested in 1994 by Customs agents as he returned from overseas. Agents found $16,000 cash and child pornography in his baggage.<ep>
   He has been convicted of distributing child pornography and sentenced to five years in prison.<ep>
   ``Simply shutting down Overseas Mail wasn't enough, because those who created the demand for child pornography were still out there,'' Hunter said.<ep>
   The post office took over the business after Kemmish was arrested, changing its name to Island Mail and running it as an undercover operation, he said.<ep>
   When people ordered child pornography from the catalog, postal inspectors made the deliveries (--) then arrested the recipients if they accepted the parcels. Most were charged with possession of child pornography.<ep>
   In all, the postal service conducted 130 searches in 36 states during its undercover operation.<ep>
   Hunter said the videos offered by Overseas Mail are ``in actuality videotaped evidence of a crime taking place. They show images of children having sex with each other or with adults (--) children as young as 7, 8 or 9 years old being sexually abused in unthinkable ways.''<ep>
   Hunter said the videos sold for from $50 to $290, depending on the age of the children. The company's financial records show it grossed $10,000 a week during one six-month period.<ep>
   Hunter said another man believed to have been involved with the company, Troy A. Frank, was found dead in Mexico last year. Hunter said Frank is believed to have committed suicide.<ep>
