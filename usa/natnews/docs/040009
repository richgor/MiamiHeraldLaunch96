<m0>    <m0>LITTLE ROCK<m0> (--) The judge in the Whitewater trial threw out four charges each against Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and Susan McDougal on Monday but let all 19 counts against James McDougal stand.<ep>
   The McDougals and Tucker were indicted in August on charges of fraud and conspiracy for allegedly misusing $3 million in federally backed loans. McDougal was named in 19 counts, Tucker 11 and Mrs. McDougal eight.<ep>
   Among the charges the judge dismissed against Mrs. McDougal was a conspiracy count alleging she helped plan some of the loan transactions. Tucker was cleared of counts involving a real estate loan.<ql>
<m1>   <m0>The defense is scheduled to begin presenting its case today. Tucker still faces seven felony charges and Mrs. McDougal four.<ql>

<m1><ue5><m0>Study finds AIDS risk<ql>
in synthetic hormone<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>    <m0>WASHINGTON <m0>(--) Federal officials are moving swiftly to start new human research to see if a synthetic hormone used in popular injectable contraceptives increases the risk of AIDS virus infection. The action was prompted by monkey research that suggested the connection.<ep>
   A study at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York City demonstrated that monkeys injected with progesterone were seven times more likely to become infected when exposed vaginally to simian immune deficiency virus, or SIV.<ep>
   Progesterone is a natural hormone, but a close synthetic chemical relative, progestin, is used in two injectable contraceptives widely sold in the United States.<ep>

Freemen's sentry base<ql>

<m0>    <m0>JORDAN<m0> (--) Two FBI surveillance planes flew repeated low circles Monday over a camper the defiant Freemen set up as a sentry base overlooking their compound.<ep>
   Two Freemen appeared relaxed as they sat in lawn chairs or paced around the 22-foot trailer, which was towed Sunday onto a ridge where members of the anti-government group have kept watch since the standoff began March 25.<ep>
   The trailer, with a grill for cooking, replaced a van that was parked at the spot.<ep>
   The move appeared to be a response to the FBI's heightened aerial surveillance that began Sunday.<ql>
