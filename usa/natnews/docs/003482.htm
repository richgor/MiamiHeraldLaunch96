   The DC-9 has long been a workhorse of U.S. aviation.<P>

   From 1958 to 1975, McDonnell Douglas and its predecessor Douglas Aircraft manufactured 976 of them.<P>

   ``It is one of the most reliable planes in aviation history,'' ValuJet President Lewis Jordan said Saturday.<P>

   But as the airline industry upgraded to bigger, newer planes in the late 1980s, many of the old DC-9s were retired. <P>

   But DC-9s returned to the skies -- primarily because of ValuJet, an Atlanta carrier that began buying the used planes at cheap prices. ValuJet's 51-airplane fleet included 48 DC-9s.<P>

   The DC-9-32 that crashed Saturday was built in 1969, Jordan said. It was one of the first four planes purchased by ValuJet, which began flying in October 1993 with two airplanes.<P>

   Jordan said the plane, with a tail registration of N904VJ, had undergone regularly scheduled maintenance, including light maintenance in May and March, and heavier maintenance in October.<P>

   Experts cautioned that it is too early to speculate about the cause of Saturday's crash, but some recalled other fatal DC-9 crashes.<P>

   The most recent occurred in 1994 near North Carolina's Charlotte-Douglas Airport, when a DC-9-30 crashed in a thunderstorm, killing 37 of 57 people on board.<P>

   In 1983, an Air Canada DC-9 flying from Dallas to Toronto made an emergency landing at the Greater Cincinnati Airport after a fire broke out on the plane about 90 minutes into the flight. Twenty-three people were killed.<P>

   Testimony at a National Transportation Safety Board hearing on that crash centered on the plane's electrical system, particularly the wiring in the toilet-flushing motor in a rear lavatory.<P>

   Also in 1994, a DC-9 flown by British tour operator Airtours made an emergency landing in Manchester, England, after a fire broke out in the rear galley. No one was killed.<P>

   Investigators will be somewhat hampered in their investigation of Saturday's crash because the DC-9 has an old-style flight recorder, which measures only nine different aircraft functions, said an NTSB official.<P>

   Newer airplanes have black boxes with 70 sensors measuring functions including air speed, throttle position, engine speed and fuel and electrical readings.<P>

   Bill Tiedeman, a former Eastern pilot who flew the DC-9 for 12 years, said it is too early to say what caused the fire.<P>

   ``Smoke in the cockpit in itself is not all that serious,'' he said. ``A lot of little things can happen in an airplane.''<P>

   Tiedeman noted that in Miami's previous worst airplane crash, in 1972, there were no major problems with the L1011 that went down in the Everglades.<P>

   ``It crashed because no one was paying attention,'' he said. ``All three guys in the cockpit were working on the problem. No one was flying the airplane.''
