   WASHINGTON -- When the inevitable Whitewater question came during his news conference Thursday with the visiting president of Greece, President Clinton stiffened just a bit, his pose assuming the formality of a man who soon would be seen under oath in a Little Rock courtroom. ``My testimony will speak for itself,'' he said when asked what he wanted the American people to take away from his videotaped testimony.<P>

   A moment later, Clinton added one more thing he wanted people to know. ``I didn't say anything different in the trial that I haven't said in public,'' he said.<P>

   It was a reminder that, in the long-running scandal known as Whitewater, no news is the best news for the president.<P>

   Courtrooms are not places Americans expect to see their presidents. Simply by testifying as a defense witness in a criminal trial -- in a case in which he and Hillary Rodham Clinton have been central players -- Clinton reminded Americans of the investigation into his personal financial dealings, and that alone could have political repercussions.<P>

A political toothache?<P>

   But if Republicans were hoping for dramatic revelations or major inconsistencies in Clinton's testimony shown Thursday, they probably were disappointed. And in a White House praying for no surprises on Whitewater this year, the president delivered just what they wanted.<P>

   A sympathetic Democrat described the Whitewater investigation as a political toothache for the president, a persistent but so-far still manageable pain, nothing life-threatening. Public opinion has settled into opposing camps, and in the absence of new developments -- convictions, indictments or smoking guns -- it may not change much before November. On that point, at least, Republican and Democratic analysts agree.<P>

   ``There's a fair amount of [questionable] behavior around Whitewater, in Arkansas and to some degree in the White House,'' one Republican strategist said Thursday. ``Voters have already factored that into their judgments of Clinton. There would have to be new information to cause voters to change their minds as to how seriously to weigh this issue in judging Clinton. . . . Reminding people that Whitewater is a mess and the Clintons are involved in it doesn't in itself do anything.''<P>

   Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg echoed that view. ``I don't think the thing changes unless there's a finding,'' he said.<P>

   In that case, what happened Thursday in Little Rock may be far less important than what may yet happen in independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation.<P>

Voters making judgments<P>

   In March, a Washington Post-ABC News Poll found that 55 percent of the American people said Whitewater was not an important issue, while 43 percent said it was important. That margin closely mirrored the gap between Clinton and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the prospective Republican presidential nominee, lending credence to the idea that most voters have already taken what they know about Whitewater into account in judging the president.<P>

   Clinton's opponents and the news media now want access to the president's videotaped testimony. Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour refused recently to rule out using the tape in a political commercial. <P>

   But in the absence of new developments, the Republicans face their own dilemma on Whitewater. The Post-ABC News poll in March showed that, by almost 2-1, the American people disapprove of the way Republicans in Congress have been handling the Whitewater investigation. ``The Republicans are paying a price on the congressional side,'' Greenberg said. He added, ``If they want to spend their campaign time talking about this, it would hurt them.''
