   WASHINGTON -- Over the objections of the Pentagon and the FBI, the House Intelligence Committee approved legislation Thursday that would sharply increase the power of the CIA chief at the expense of other Cabinet secretaries.<P>

   Designed to streamline the nation's spy apparatus, the bill would trim a confused bureaucratic structure by concentrating authority in the hands of the CIA director, according to Republican supporters. Hoping to improve chances of passage, Republicans dropped a measure that would have created a separate clandestine spy service apart from the CIA.<P>

   ``The intelligence community must be managed as a more corporate entity,'' said Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, chairman of the committee.<P>

   Democrats said the bill, HR-3237, was being rushed through without allowing senior administration officials a chance to air their concerns.<P>

   In a party-line 6-3 vote, the Republican-controlled panel approved the bill, dubbed ``IC-21,'' a blueprint for the intelligence community in the 21st century. The measure is expected to come to the House floor next week. The Senate is working on its own bill restructuring the intelligence bureaucracy.<P>

   The White House, Pentagon, FBI and Justice Department have all voiced concerns about the legislation. No representative from those power centers has testified before the committee, although they did make their concerns known in letters.<P>

   Deputy Defense Secretary John White, in a letter to Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, wrote that there are now ``clear and unambiguous lines of authority'' from the defense secretary to the chiefs of the military intelligence agencies. Giving the CIA chief power to approve appointees to the defense intelligence organizations could blur those lines of authority.<P>

   FBI Director Louis Freeh wrote to Combest about a provision in the bill establishing a new committee on ``transnational threats.'' It would include the CIA and FBI chiefs as well as the secretaries of defense and state, among others, and would oversee such things as drug trafficking, organized crime and terrorism.<P>

   ``The FBI concern is that you could have these non-law enforcement officials directing what are law enforcement functions,'' according to an intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity.<P>

   A third letter, from Assistant Attorney General Andrew Fois, questioned a provision enabling the CIA director to transfer money or personnel from one part of the National Foreign Intelligence Program to another. In theory, this could give the director the power to reassign FBI agents working on drug operations or terrorism and shift funds from these efforts to other intelligence activities.<P>

   ``We're going to cause a bureaucracy war that we may not be able to contain,'' said Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., a member of the intelligence committee.<P>

   CIA Director John Deutch, testifying on intelligence reform last month, said President Clinton supports giving him power to approve senior appointees across the intelligence community.<P>

   ``I'm sure you understand,'' Deutch told the Senate Intelligence Committee, ``that many of my cabinet colleagues -- secretaries of defense, secretaries of state, the attorney general -- have concerns about how future directors of Central Intelligence would ... play this role.''
