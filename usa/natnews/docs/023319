<m0>   Don McNeill, the cheerful host who welcomed millions of radio listeners across the United States and Canada to a new day for more than 35 years as the creator and host of <m0>Don McNeill's<m0> <m0>Breakfast Club<m0>, died Tuesday in Evanston, Ill. McNeill, who lived in Winnetka, Ill., was 88.<ep>
   Five times a week, from June 23, 1933, until Dec. 27, 1968, the genial McNeill presided over a variety show that mixed a generous helping of corny humor with spontaneous <m4>McNeill<m2><ql>
<m0>interviews, songs, celebrity guests, the inspirational Moment of Silent Prayer, skits with the gossipy spinster Aunt Fanny, the nostalgic Memory Time and the March Around the Breakfast Table. The show's four 15-minute segments were divided into ``calls to breakfast.''<ep>
   ``Good morning, Breakfast Clubbers,'' McNeill would say, and from coast to coast from 8 to 9 a.m. central, mountain and Pacific time and from 9 to 10 a.m. in the East, loyal listeners to more than 300 stations during the program's heyday in the 1940s readied themselves for the high-spirits broadcast first on NBC and then on ABC.<ep>
   The talent included entertainers like Patti Page, Johnny Desmond and Toots & Chickie, an act that later achieved fame as Fibber McGee and Molly.<ep>
   There were celebrity guests like Groucho Marx, who said: ``I don't see how McNeill does it. As a matter of fact, I don't think McNeill does it. I think he stays home and sleeps all morning. I think that's really George Jessel up there, putting on an Ohio accent.''<ep>
   But indeed it was McNeill, capitalizing on the chance he was given in 1933, when he became master of ceremonies of <m0>The Pepper Pot<m0>, a sponsorless show with an anemic listenership. He changed the name to <m0>Breakfast Club<m0>, got permission to ad lib, and the fan mail poured in.<ep>
     Don McNeill was born Dec. 23, 1907, in Galena, Ill., and grew up mainly in Sheboygan, Wis. He enrolled in journalism school at Marquette University in Wisconsin, planning to become an editorial cartoonist, when his father's furniture factory failed. McNeill found a $15-a-week job at a Milwaukee radio station, worked at The Milwaukee Sentinel and graduated from Marquette with a bachelor's degree in <m1> <m0>philosophy.<ep>
   He worked at radio stations in Louisville and San Francisco before he got his chance on <m0>The Pepper Pot<m0>  for $50 a week. <m1><ep>
<m0>After <m0>Breakfast Club <m0>went off the air, McNeill taught at Marquette and Notre Dame, represented the Deltona Corp., Florida land developers, <m1> <m0>and served as a director of the Sears Foundation and on the advisory boards of Notre Dame, Marquette and Loyola University of Chicago.<ep>
   He is survived by three sons, Thomas B. and Robert P., of Winnetka, and the Rev. Donald, of South Bend, Ind.; a sister, Agnes Donohue of Evanston, Ill.; eight grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.<ep>
