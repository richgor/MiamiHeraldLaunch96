   Garth Williams, the artist who illustrated E.B. White's Stuart Little  and Charlotte's Web  and scores of other children's classics, died Wednesday at his home in Guanajuato, Mexico. He was 84.<P>

   With the precision of Duerer but with his own sense of innocence and wonderment, Williams created a world of storybook characters. Although the books were written by a diverse range of authors, the drawings all had Williams' impeccable, heart<BR>
warming touch.<P>

   Generations of children picture their favorite fictional characters as drawn by Williams: that dapper mouse Stuart Little; the kindhearted spider Charlotte and her friend, Wilbur the pig; and bears, dogs, kittens, crickets, elves, fairies, children and grown-ups in books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, George Selden, Charlotte Zolotow, Else H. Minarik and many others. Williams also wrote the text for seven children's books, but it is primarily as an illustrator that his work is cherished.<P>

   He believed that books ``given, or read, to children can have a profound influence.'' For that reason, he said, he used his illustrations to try to ``awaken something of importance . . . humor, responsibility, respect for others, interest in the world at large.''<P>

   Born in New York City, Williams was the son of artists. He tried to become a cartoonist at The New Yorker, but his work was rejected, he said, because his style ``was considered too wild and European.'' He did, however, publish small drawings in the magazine.<P>

   Ursula Nordstrom, the editor of children's books at Harper and Row, was more encouraging, and told him she was expecting a manuscript that he might illustrate. In a fortuitous coincidence, when the manuscript arrived the author had pinned a note to it saying, Try Garth Williams.'' The author was E. B. White, the book was Stuart Little.<P>

   In his review of Stuart Little  in The New York Times Book Review in 1945, Malcolm Cowley praised the book as ``one of the best children's books published this year,'' but never mentioned the name of the illustrator (often Williams' fate).<P>

   Stuart Little  was such an enormous success that Williams decided to become a full-time illustrator of children's books. In 1952, he and White collaborated on Charlotte's Web, the story of a spider who saves the life of a pig.<P>

   During the 1950s, Williams also illustrated Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House on the Prairie  and its sequels. In addition, he illustrated books by Margaret Wise Brown, Russell Hoban and Randall Jarrell, among others. Among his most popular books were those written by George Selden, beginning with The Cricket in Times Square.
