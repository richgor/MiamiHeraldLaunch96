   WASHINGTON (--) The FBI has advised Jewish organizations to be on ``heightened alert'' because of a threat to kill 1,200 Jewish executives and doctors in the United States unless Israel withdraws its military forces from Lebanon and pays $12 billion in compensation by today.<ep>
   The FBI said it learned of the threat through ``information received by a private party which turned it over to the FBI.'' The agency did not identify the party and did not say if the person or organization issuing the threat, which was delivered in a letter, had identified itself.<ep>
   ``There is no way to know at this time if the threat is real, but the FBI believes that Jewish organizations, synagogues and individuals should for their own safety be on heightened alert,'' the FBI said.<ep>
   Privately, federal law enforcement officials discounted the likelihood that the letter represented a legitimate threat. But they said they were publicizing it as a precaution.<ep>
   The FBI said it had notified its field offices and other federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies about the threat and that the Israeli government had been informed.<ep>
