<H2>Jury out in Kevorkian's 3rd assisted-suicide trial</H2>

   PONTIAC, Mich. -- (AP) -- Jurors began deliberations Friday in Dr. Jack Kevorkian's third assisted-suicide trial after his lawyer told them the doctor was the target of vindictive Michigan judges and prosecutors.<P>

   The common-law crime under which Kevorkian is charged was unconstitutionally fabricated by a tyrannical Michigan Supreme Court and state Court of Appeals, attorney Geoffrey Fieger told jurors during his closing arguments.<P>

   ``Some men and women got together in a back room in Lansing and said, `How do we get Jack Kevorkian?' '' Fieger said.<P>

   Assistant prosecutor Lawrence Bunting said Kevorkian's conspiracy theory ``sounds like paranoia run rampant.''<P>

   ``That's not a legal argument.''<P>

   Jurors began deliberating after receiving instructions from Oakland County Circuit Judge David F. Breck. One alternate juror, after being excused, said he would have voted to convict, while another said she was leaning toward acquittal.<P>

   Kevorkian, who has been acquitted twice of similar charges, faces up to five years in prison on each of two counts if convicted.<P>

   He does not dispute attending the suicides of Sherry Miller and Marjorie Wantz in 1991, and providing the materials used in their deaths. Miller, 43, of Roseville had multiple sclerosis and died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Wantz, 58, of Sodus had severe pelvic pain and was given a lethal drug injection.<P>

   Fieger repeated his argument that Kevorkian intended to relieve the women's pain, not to see them die.<P>

   ``We're not talking about death. We're not talking about killing people. We're talking about ending suffering,'' he said.<P>

   But Bunting said Kevorkian could only intend to kill someone by providing lethal drugs and gas. To say otherwise, he said, ``is to play fast and loose with the truth, with common sense and with the facts.''<P>

   Kevorkian is being tried based on a 1994 Michigan Supreme Court ruling that said assisted suicide is a common-law crime. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider Kevorkian's appeal.<P>

   The doctor has acknowledged attending 28 deaths since he began his crusade for physician-assisted suicide in 1990. The last death he attended was on Monday, hours after taking the witness stand in his own defense.<P>

   After being excused, alternate juror Dave Hamilton, a 19-year-old architecture student, said he would have voted to convict even though he supports doctor-assisted suicide and felt Kevorkian took the proper precautions before he helped the two women to die.<P>

   ``You're supposed to go by the law. If it's illegal . . .'' he said, shrugging his shoulders.<P>

   Denise Darling, a 21-year-old veterinary assistant, said she would have had to review all the evidence, but said she was leaning toward acquittal.<P>

   ``I believe in what Dr. Kevorkian does,'' she said.
