   ST. CLAIR SHORES, Mich. -- A couple was convicted Thursday of failing to control their 16-year-old son in violation of this upscale suburb's parental responsibility ordinance.<P>

   Anthony and Susan Provenzino have been on trial this week on allegations they failed to control their son, Alex, who is serving a year in a juvenile detention facility.<P>

   District Judge William Crouchman fined each parent $100, the maximum allowed, and assessed $1,000 in court costs. A jury deliberated about 15 minutes after hearing three days of testimony.<P>

   The couple had contended they did their best with the boy, but admitted to violating part of a previous order that he be supervised at all times. Provenzino had testified he held the justice system partly responsible for failing to keep his son in custody longer the first time he was arrested.<P>

   The Provenzinos could have been ordered to pay up to $27,000 in damages, stemming from burglaries and other delinquent behavior by their son. But Crouchman said he found that section of the ordinance to be in conflict with state law, and so didn't order any civil penalty.<P>

   ``I think this was a vote in favor of the family and vote in favor of parental responsibility,'' City Attorney Robert Ihrie said after the verdict was announced.<P>

   He said the Provenzinos ``essentially shrugged their shoulders and said, `Gee, we didn't know anything about this.' ''<P>

   Anthony Provenzino called the verdict ``terribly painful.'' But he urged other parents ``to do the best they can in raising their children. I don't know what else you can do.''<P>

   Their attorney, William Bufalino, noted that the parents are currently paying $155 a day for their son's housing in a juvenile detention center.<P>

   ``These `bad parents' are paying every day, paying court costs,'' Bufalino told jurors before deliberations began.<P>

   ``They are paying for the sins of their son,'' he said. ``They are not paying for their sins. They don't have any.''<P>

   Earlier Thursday, Provenzino told WJR radio that his son ``is rehabilitating very nicely'' and has changed while in juvenile detention.<P>

   Howard Davidson of the American Bar Association's Center on Children and the Law in Washington, D.C., said the concept of criminal sanctions for parents of wayward children is not new, and the number of such laws and ordinances has increased in recent years. He said many proceedings are held in juvenile court and not open to the public.
