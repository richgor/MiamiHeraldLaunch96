   NEW YORK (--) (AP) (--) Do forgive the intrusion, Mr. Cab Driver, but would you be so kind as to inform us of your feelings with regard to the city's request that you and your brethren learn to address customers more politely?<ep>
   ``You riding, or talking?'' demanded one taxi driver, cornered at a traffic light Monday.<ep>
   Um, talking.<ep>
   ``Then I'm riding,'' he replied, and sped off in search of a paying customer.<ep>
   So maybe it's not such a bad thing that the Taxi and Limousine Commission is asking New York City's cab drivers to learn 50 new, nice things to say, such as: ``Thank you for hailing me'' and ``Is there any particular route you would like today?''<ep>
   The courtesy phrases were given to the city's latest crop of 96 prospective cab drivers when training classes began two weeks ago. A sample:<ep>
   (box) ``I'm sorry if you think I am driving too fast, madam. I will slow down immediately.''<ep>
   (box) ``Please excuse the bumpy ride. I'll do my best to avoid the potholes.''<ep>
   What do the old cabbies think about the idea?<ep>
   Of the six drivers at the long line of yellow cabs outside the New York Hilton, three did not understand the question, one refused to roll down his window, and another said he hated reporters. The sixth, Russian-born Yakov Chaulov, said drivers should be polite.<ep>
``I myself am very friendly,'' he said. <m2><ep>
