   DETROIT (--) A jury in an upscale Detroit suburb Thursday convicted the parents of a wayward teenager of a criminal misdemeanor for failing to control him. The case has caught the attention of a nation at once alarmed by soaring juvenile crime rates and concerned about punishing parents for their children's misbehavior.<ep>
   The jury deliberated less than half an hour before convicting Susan and Anthony Provenzino of St. Clair Shores, Mich., of violating a city ordinance that requires parents ``to exercise reasonable parental control'' over children under 18.<ep>
   No one disputes that the couple's son, Alex Provenzino, 16, was out of control.<ep>
   Witnesses, including the boy himself, testified that he had repeatedly defied his parents in front of witnesses: He smoked marijuana, drank, cursed his mother and once attacked his father with a golf club. He committed crimes in his neighborhood as well, including burglary. He has admitted stealing $3,500 from the church his family attends.<ep>
   Young Provenzino is currently serving a one-year sentence at a juvenile jail for burglary and drug offenses.<ep>
   Prosecutors argued that despite the son's pattern of disruptive, sometimes violent behavior, the parents never forced their son to undergo counseling. Indeed, the prosecutors demonstrated that the Provenzinos knew little about their son's activities.<ep>
   Police told the court that on searching his second-floor room they had found a stolen handgun, a stolen knife, a bag of marijuana and a tall marijuana plant, along with an alcoholic beverage.<ep>
   In their defense, the parents said that they did not know the extent of their child's wrongdoings, and intimated that they were afraid of him. They have three other children.<ep>
   Taking the stand in his parents' behalf, the youth said that he had tried to keep his activities secret and that his parents had reprimanded him after learning about some of his crimes.<ep>
   After the jury's guilty verdict, a judge fined his parents $100 each and ordered each to pay $1,000 in court costs for their failure to properly supervise their son.<ep>
   ``A jury today decided that St. Clair Shores was burning and the parents were fiddling,'' said Robert Ihrie, who prosecuted the case.<ep>
   But William Bufalino, the lawyer for the Provenzinos, said the city's ordinance was unconstitutional because it punishes one person for another's crimes. ``Both the father and mother are being punished for the sins of the son.''<ep>
   Provenzino said after the verdict: ``It is very painful to be found guilty. We're shocked, we're sad, we're disappointed and we're surprised.''<ep>
   The two-year-old St. Clair Shores ordinance is a ripple in the wave of statutes that towns and cities have enacted in recent years in an attempt to crack down on parents whose children are misbehaving.<ep>
   Many states, including Florida, have passed similar laws that allow localities to punish the parents of young criminals.<ep>
   The American Civil Liberties Union says that the parental responsibility laws may be unconstitutional because they effectively punish parents for their children's actions, and because they are often vague.<ep>
   Other experts cautioned that without requirements that counseling and education be made available to parents, the new laws might further harm troubled families.<ep>
   ``People are struggling with what to do about juvenile crime because we all fear its increase and its consequences,'' said Howard Davidson, the director of the American Bar Association's Center on Children and the Law. ``There is a risk that in our concern, we will look for quick-fix solutions,'' that fail to address underlying family problems.<ep>
