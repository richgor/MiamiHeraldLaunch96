   LOS ANGELES -- Like other teen-agers, 17-year-old Kissandra Cohen is gearing up for the pomp and circumstance of her graduation.<P>

   But unlike her peers, Kissandra won't be receiving a high school diploma.<P>

   Instead, the child prodigy will have earned a double degree from Duke University in economics and sociology.<P>

   ``I don't want people to have preconceived ideas about me,'' Kissandra said last month, in between studying for her final exams.<P>

   ``I've purposely avoided the age issue. If they know me as the 17-year-old college senior, then they'll think all I do is study and that's just not the case,'' said Kissandra, who will graduate from Duke with honors and a 3.7 grade point average.<P>

   While many graduates her age are looking forward to a summer on the beach, Kissandra already has meticulously mapped out her future well into the next century.<P>

   In the fall, she will begin working on her law degree and her master's degree in business administration -- simultaneously. Then, she says, it's off to medical school.<P>

   ``I'm going to end up coming out of medical school at the same age other medical students would typically graduate. The only difference is that I'll have my law degree and my master's as well,'' Kissandra said.<P>

   ``I figure if I work for an HMO in administration, I could also use my law degree to represent the HMO legally, and use my medical knowledge as a basis for a lot of the cases I'll be dealing with. I think it's the perfect mix,'' she said.<P>

   It is that sort of self-determination that has driven Kissandra for most of her life.<P>

   She credits her attitude to her parents, who she says have never pressured her, but have always been supportive and have taught her to value education.<P>

   ``I know that whatever I set my heart on doing, I will accomplish it. As long as I never lose motivation or sight of my goals then I'll be fine,'' she said.<P>

   For Pamela Cohen, Kissandra's mother, the past 17 years have been a blur. It seems that it was only yesterday her daughter was a precocious 2-year-old, hamming it up for the home video camera, she said.<P>

   When Kissandra was 1 year old, she was speaking in sentences. By the time she was 2 she was reciting the national anthem and speaking Spanish, Pamela Cohen said.<P>

   ``She was reading and writing at 2. She was my first child so I read to her a lot. She articulated beautifully. . . . At 3 she was so advanced, we didn't know what to do with her,'' said Cohen.<P>

   At 3, Kissandra tested her way into kindergarten and also started playing the piano and the violin.<P>

   At 4, she was in the first grade at a private school, and had started acting, landing her first television commercial.<P>

   At 6 -- with an IQ of 158 -- Kissandra was attending a magnet elementary school program in Studio City. She also started modeling and acting in stage productions. She landed roles on several soap operas and television commercials -- including spots for McDonald's and Mattel toys.<P>

   At 10, while attending Portola Highly Gifted Magnet Center in Tarzana, Kissandra began taking college courses. She managed to earn the highest A in her UCLA calculus class.<P>

   By the time she was 14, Kissandra had skipped high school and had earned a liberal arts associates degree from Pierce College.<P>

   She transferred to Duke as a 15-year-old junior. Her mother moved to North Carolina and even took some courses with her for much of Kissandra's first year away from home.<P>

   ``It's hard for me to let go,'' Pamela Cohen said. ``But she's succeeding in life and I'm happy for her.''<P>

   Eric Meyers, one of Kissandra's professors at Duke, said he only recently learned of Kissandra's age. ``I was very surprised. She's a very brilliant, talented young woman,'' said Meyers, who teaches religion and Judaic studies.<P>

   Kissandra has been accepted into several law schools, including Pepperdine; UCLA; the University of California, Davis; and Hastings. And she is still waiting to hear from several other schools.
