<m0>   <m0>STRATFORD<m0> (--) A military transport helicopter undergoing a flight check before it was to be added to the White House fleet crashed and burned Thursday at Sikorsky Aircraft, killing all four crew members.<ep>
   Dozens of people working nearby and passing motorists watched in horror as the huge Sikorsky-built Super Stallion labored above the airfield, then dropped straight to the ground.<ep>
   The cause of the crash and the identity of the crew members were not immediately known.<ep>
   The CH-53E helicopter was to be assigned to a Marine unit at Quantico, Va., that provides support services for the White House. The helicopter would not have been used to carry the president.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>MARTINEZ<m0> (--) The 6-year-old boy suspected of beating a 5-week-old baby nearly to death can be released from juvenile hall but not returned to his family, a juvenile court referee says.<ep>
   The boy will be placed in a group home (--) ``secure'' but not locked (--) as soon as one can be found that is deemed suitable by both the defense and prosecution teams, Juvenile Court Referee Stephen Easton said Wednesday.<ep>
   A child advocate employed by the county asked that the 6-year-old, believed to be the youngest person in the nation charged with attempted murder, not be shackled or handcuffed during the transfer. The name and address of the group home will not be released, Easton said.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>BEATRICE<m0> (--) At least a dozen homes near this town were destroyed Wednesday night, torn apart by high winds as a string of thunderstorms packing hail, hard rain and tornadoes moved through the Midwest and Ohio Valley.<ep>
   No major injuries were reported, but the storms forced dozens of people to evacuate and knocked out power to thousands. One person was missing in a flood in Missouri.<ep>
   The town of about 12,000 was left a mess: Schools were canceled Thursday, and water poured through holes in the roof of the town auditorium.<ql>
