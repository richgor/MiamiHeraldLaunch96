<m0>   <m0>WASHINGTON <m0>(--) Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition, tried to dispel any impression Saturday that he was out of step with other leaders of the anti-abortion movement, angrily dismissing as ``totally inaccurate'' a news article saying he would accept changes in the party's platform.<ep>
   In a statement, the Christian Coalition said Saturday that the New York Times article ``inaccurately states'' that Reed ``would be willing to accept rape and incest exceptions as a possible change in the wording of the pro-life plank of the Republican Party's platform.''<ep>
   Reed said the Christian Coalition favored an exception to an abortion ban only if the mother's life was endangered.<ep>

<m0>   <m0>LOMA LINDA<m0> (--) Parents of Siamese twins joined at the abdomen are celebrating the girls' birth, having overcome the initial shock of their children's medical condition.<ep>
   Jeff and Michelle Roderick, both 29, say they are beaming with pride and still getting acquainted with the girls, Shawna Leilani and Janelle Kiana.<ep>
   The girls were delivered by Caesarean section last week at Loma Linda University Medical Center. Facing each other and sharing liver tissue, they weighed a combined 11 pounds, 4.7 ounces at birth. Doctors hope to attempt a separation in a few months.<ep>
  Michelle Roderick said she was upset when she first learned in December that the twins were joined. The couple decided against abortion, and the girls were born with a good prognosis for successful separation. ``We've been double-blessed with these girls,'' the mother said.<ep>
