<m0>   Aurand Harris, a prolific playwright for children's theater, best known for his 1963 classic <m0>Androcles and the Lion,<m0>  died Monday in New York. He was 80.<ep>
   Harris penned more than 50 published plays beginning with <m0>Once Upon a Clothesline<m0>  in 1945, which broke from the fairy tales traditionally featured in children's theater and instead profiled two characters dressed in yellow jumpsuits to resemble clothespins.<ep>
   Among his most popular plays are <m0>Steal Away Home,<m0>  <m0>Yankee Doodle<m0>  and <m0>The Arkansaw Bear.<m0> <ep>
   He often directed his own plays and was invited to China in 1988 to direct his version of <m0>Rags to Riches<m0>  in Shanghai.<ep>
   Harris also edited several anthologies, among them <m0>Plays Children Love<m0> ; and <m0>Short Plays of Theatre Classics.<m0> <ep>
   He taught at Grace Church School in Manhattan and at New York University.<ep>
   A book called <m0>The Theatre of Aurand Harris: His Career, His Theories, His Plays<m0>  is scheduled for publication in June.<ep>
