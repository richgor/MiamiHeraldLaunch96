   Seventy years ago, on May 9, 1926, Richard E. Byrd and his pilot-mechanic, Floyd Bennett, won fame as the first to fly an airplane to the North Pole. Or so they claimed. Doubts that they reached the pole have persisted to this day, and a few skeptics have suspected they never even made a serious attempt.<ep>
   Now, archivists at Ohio State University have found the diary Byrd kept on the flight. After examining the diary, a specialist in navigation and science history has concluded that Byrd almost certainly fell short of his polar destination and must have known at the time that he had not succeeded.<ep>
   If Byrd did not succeed, historians of polar exploration said, the team on the dirigible Norge (--) Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen, American Lincoln Ellsworth and Italian Umberto Nobile (--) should be recognized as the first to fly over the North Pole. Their flight was three days later than Byrd's, and its success in reaching the pole has never been questioned.<ep>
   At the time, Byrd was hailed as a national hero, paraded up Broadway and welcomed with medals by President Calvin Coolidge. Byrd later become the first person to fly over the South Pole and lead expeditions to Antarctica. <ep>
   Dennis Rawlins, an independent scholar in Baltimore who specializes in navigation studies and analyzing the records of polar explorers, examined the diary's notes and calculations. He said they appeared to exonerate Byrd in the case of an especially damning accusation, circulated by a former colleague in 1971, that the explorer had not made a genuine attempt.<ep>
   The accuser, Bernt Balchen, maintained that Byrd and Bennett had merely disappeared over the horizon, flown around for a certain time and returned to their base at Spitsbergen, Norway, with the claim that they had reached the North Pole.<ep>
   As it was, Rawlins said, Byrd's airplane probably came within 2 1/4 degrees of the pole before the two men, concerned about an engine leak, decided to turn back. That would have put the airplane 150 miles short of the pole. <ep>
   ``Had the motor's leak not occurred, Byrd and Bennett <m1> <m0>. . . would have succeeded in hitting the pole,'' Rawlins said.<ep>
