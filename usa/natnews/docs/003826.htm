   PHILADELPHIA -- For most of his 26 years on the run, all Richard Thomas had to worry about was staying out of trouble and keeping his story straight.<P>

   In the end, that was no longer enough.<P>

   A month ago, a small-town Illinois policeman, suspicious that Thomas was a pickpocket, weeded through his aliases and identified the balding, middle-aged construction worker as the onetime black radical wanted in the murder of a Philadelphia cop in 1970.<P>

   And the officer did so from a computer inside his patrol car.<P>

   Thomas, 49, now sits in a Chicago-area jail, fighting extradition.<P>

   ``I said, `Fingerprints say there's a warrant for you,' '' recalled the arresting officer, Edwin Rann of the River Forest Police Department. ``He said, `I might as well tell you . . . '. ''<P>

   These days, the long arm of the law reaches deep into cyberspace. An explosion of dual-use technology, much of it developed for the military, has strapped high-tech tools to the hips of police officers at a time when many are feeling outgunned and overrun by criminals.<P>

   In some departments, computer-generated composite photos are replacing the pencils and pads of sketch artists. Digital enhancers are revealing hidden details in photographs -- such as license plates -- to give detectives important leads. Fingerprint files that would take years to search by hand are now sorted in minutes by computers that mimic human deduction.<P>

   ``People that would previously have slipped through the cracks are being apprehended and charged,'' said Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit think tank in Washington.<P>

   Yet the transition from Blue Knight to Buck Rogers faces some obstacles. Much of the emerging technology is too expensive for most police departments. A lot of it is still experimental, and some battlefield tools have proved ill-suited for police work.<P>

   Still, police agencies that have long been wed to traditional approaches have begun to experiment, though the most imaginative gadgets aren't widely available yet. Even as a group, law-enforcement agencies don't have enough purchasing power to interest manufacturers in costly research-and-development projects. And in an era when local budgets are being cut, any new funds tend to go almost exclusively toward hiring officers.<P>

   ``Television programs often suggest that police have lots of fancy equipment,'' David Boyd, director of science and technology at the National Institute of Justice, testified before Congress last year. ``Unfortunately, most of this equipment is actually unavailable to local law enforcement.''<P>

   Scientists also have found that adapting military hardware to police work can be hard -- the two groups have distinctly different missions. Police are not out to obliterate an enemy; they must treat law breakers with a certain respect. And, unlike ** COLUMN 2 **<BR>
<BR>

the service branches, police cannot accept civilian casualties as part of the job.<P>

   Still, advances are seeping into law enforcement, including the in-car computer that was used to identify Richard Thomas at a bus stop outside Chicago. Thomas is charged in one of the most notorious police slayings in Philadelphia history -- the 1970 shooting of Sgt. Frank Von Colln in Cobbs Creek Park.<P>

   The ``mobile data terminal'' (MDT) is the same computer popularized in the 1991 Arnold Schwarzenegger film, Terminator 2: Judgment Day,  used by the evil T-1000 cyborg as he piloted a stolen Los Angeles police car.<P>

   MDTs are scheduled to be installed next month in 63 police cruisers in Philadelphia's Southwest Police Division. Officers in the pilot program will be able to check warrants and retrieve arrest records on their own, freeing air time for dispatchers who now run a million checks a year.<P>

   ``We're moving forward,'' said Police Commissioner Richard Neal. ``The time we save can be redirected at preventative patrol, and that time will generate into making the streets safer.''<P>

   This summer, officials hope to start moving toward a paperless operation, installing seven or eight personal computers in each of the city's seven detective divisions.<P>

   Police recently bought a $1 million Computer Aided Dispatch system to improve handling of the 3 million calls to 911 each year. CAD, as it's called, identifies the site of the call, sets a priority for response based on information from a dispatcher, and indicates the closest police car. It works 400 times faster than the machine it replaced -- and fills a space the size of a file cabinet.<P>

   Yet space-age technology isn't of much use if the human element fails.<P>

   Philadelphia police learned that lesson in 1993, when a civilian fingerprint technician, working on the slaying of Police Officer Charles Knox, failed to identify a suspect's fingerprints using a specialized computer system. Five months later, a state trooper nailed the suspect, using the same system.<P>

   Angry Philadelphia homicide detectives complained that the investigation could have been completed in days if the technician had properly analyzed the data. He was later transferred to another job.<P>

   City police commanders say technicians now are much more familiar with the system, called AFIS, for Automated Fingerprint Identification System.<P>

   The computer scans a database of more than a million fingerprints to produce a short list of possible matches. Then technicians try to match the prints through visual examination, as if piecing together a puzzle. The system enabled California police to track down Richard Ramirez, the serial killer known as the Night Stalker, by combing 1.7 million fingerprints -- a job that would have taken 67 years if done by hand.<P>

   AFIS can determine someone's identity even in crimes that were ** COLUMN 3 **<BR>
<BR>

committed ages ago. Other new machines have similar capabilities.<P>

   Just ask Richard Thomas, whose attempt to hide behind four different names was uncovered by a computer check that reached 26 years into the past. He was fingerprinted at the River Forest, Ill., police station, and those prints were transmitted to the FBI and confirmed within 10 minutes.<P>

   Faced with that evidence, Thomas made no effort to dispute that he was the wanted man, said Rann, the arresting officer.<P>

   ``He didn't appear to hold any grudge,'' Rann said.
