   WASHINGTON -- When postal inspectors came across what appeared to be a major child pornography operation, they decided it was too good a chance to pass up. Instead of just shutting it down, they changed the name and went into business.<P>

   The results of the two-year undercover operation were announced Thursday: 45 arrests in a nationwide sting, as many as 70 more to come.<P>

   ``Simply shutting down Overseas Male [the pornography distributor] wasn't enough because those who created the demand for child pornography were still out there,'' Chief Postal Inspector Kenneth J. Hunter said.<P>

   Hunter said the investigators concentrated on people who sought videos involving boys aged 7 to 11 -- offering the material for sale and bringing charges if the individuals accepted delivery of the videos.<P>

   ``We are not talking about adult videos someone can rent at some corner video store,'' Hunter said.<P>

   Hunter said his office began receiving complaints in 1993 from people who had been sent advertising for sexually explicit videos by Overseas Male, a San Diego company.<P>

   One of the operators of that business, James Leroy Kemmish, was arrested in 1994 by customs agents as he returned from Mexico. Agents found $16,000 in cash and child pornography when they searched his baggage. He has been convicted of distributing child pornography and sentenced to five years in prison.<P>

   Hunter said the agency decided to use the company's mailing lists to try to track down buyers of the porn. It sent out some 2,000 solicitations under the name Island Male, inviting people to send back a card if they were interested. <P>

   Those who asked for more information were sent letters discussing ``steamy'' videos involving boys and men of various age groups. Those who showed an interest in ages 7 to 11 were targeted.<P>

   Smith explained that when these people placed an order, it was delivered by a postal inspector. If they accepted delivery, a search warrant was obtained and their home or business searched for evidence of possession of child pornography.<P>

   Those regarded as threats to the community or likely to flee were arrested immediately, while cases were still being developed against many others, he said.<P>

   In all, the postal service conducted 130 searches in 36 states during its undercover operation, called Operation Special Delivery.<P>

    In South Florida, postal inspectors conducted searches at three homes Thursday but made no arrests. A Coconut Grove residence and two houses in Fort Lauderdale were searched by inspectors who will present their findings to a grand jury, said postal inspector Rafael Rivera.<P>

   ``The people involved are ordinary John Does who purchased this for personal purposes,'' Rivera said. ``There are no businesses involved.''<P>

   He declined to provide their names, because no arrests were made.<P>
