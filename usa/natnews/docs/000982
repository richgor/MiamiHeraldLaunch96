<m0>   TRENTON, N.J. (--) (AP) (--) Walter Petryshyn's well-ordered world began to come apart with the terrible realization that he had made an error in a textbook.<ep>
   A highly regarded Rutgers University mathematician with a reputation as a perfectionist who loved his work and his wife, Petryshyn became depressed and paranoid, started losing weight and began obsessing over apparently imaginary health problems, longtime friend Bohdan Boychuk said.<ep>
   ``He felt that his prestige was destroyed, that his colleagues in mathematics would laugh at him,'' Boychuk said.<ep>
   The obsession may have driven him over the edge. Early Monday, prosecutors say, Petryshyn smashed his wife's skull with a claw hammer 30 times. Her body was found in the couple's townhouse in North Brunswick.<ep>
   Petryshyn, a 67-year-old Ukrainian immigrant, was charged with murder in the death of Arcadia Olenska-Petryshyn, a 61-year-old painter who exhibited her work internationally. He was jailed on $500,000 bail.<ep>
   It was the textbook error that ``really broke him,'' Boychuk said.<ep>
   The problems began a year ago, when Petryshyn published the textbook <m0>Generalized Topological Degree and Semilinear Equations,<m0>  said Boychuk, a Ukrainian poet.<ep>
   ``I noted very drastic changes,'' Boychuk said. ``He discovered that there was some mistake in that book, and he told me that mistake was very serious and he couldn't solve it.''<ep>
   But Boychuk said he understood that Petryshyn's editors at Cambridge University Press in England said ``the error was small, that the book was very good, and selling.''<ep>
   ``That's the irony. It was all in his mind,'' Boychuk said.<ep>
   Petryshyn's editor, Lauren Cowles, said Petryshyn simply left out one assumption that was the basis for one of the book's central logical arguments (--) ``a technicality'' addressed by sending corrections to book reviewers for academic journals.<ep>
   ``It sounds as if his perfectionism drove him to insanity,'' said Rutgers mathematician Felix Browder, who has known Petryshyn for decades.<ep>
   Boychuck said the professor had complained of ``all kinds of pains.'' Antoni Kosinski, chairman of Rutgers' mathematics department, said Petryshyn was given a medical leave in February because he was losing his voice frequently, which made it difficult for him to lecture.<ep>
   Petryshyn's wife and sister tried to help him, and Boychuk called frequently to boost his spirits. The professor got treatment from a psychiatrist, but when the doctor suggested he enter a mental hospital for observation, Boychuk said, Petryshyn got scared and stopped trusting everyone.<ep>
   That worried his wife, who complained to Boychuk recently that it was very oppressive living with Petryshyn's terrors.<ep>
   Petryshyn is an expert in theoretical and applied mathematics, specializing in nonlinear functional analysis and numerical functional analysis.<ep>
