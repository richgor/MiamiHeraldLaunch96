<m0>   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (--) (AP) (--) Taking the stand at his fraud trial Tuesday, James McDougal, President Clinton's former Whitewater partner, denied he had committed any crimes and insisted he had never met with then-Gov. Clinton in the mid-1980s about an allegedly fraudulent loan.<ep>
   <m4>McDougal<m2><ql>
<m0>McDougal also proclaimed the innocence of his former wife, Susan McDougal, and Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, and offered to shoulder the blame for actions that prosecutors are trying to pin on Susan McDougal.<ep>
   Tucker and the McDougals were indicted in August on fraud and conspiracy charges for allegedly misusing $3 million in federally backed loans obtained before Tucker became governor in 1992.<ep>
   Former banker David Hale testified earlier in the trial that McDougal and Tucker schemed with him to generate loans to benefit themselves and their business partners.<ep>
   The 55-year-old McDougal, who is in poor health, moved slowly to the witness stand and spoke in a subdued tone in nearly two hours of questioning.<ep>
   ``I had no loans to any political person,'' he testified. Of Tucker, he said, ``He's done nothing illegal that I know of. We certainly didn't enter into a conspiracy.''<ep>
   McDougal made it clear he regards Hale (--) a disgraced municipal judge (--) as a liar.<ql>
