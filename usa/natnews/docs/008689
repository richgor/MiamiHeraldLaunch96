<m0>   LOS ANGELES (--) Richard Rouilard, the flamboyant and innovative former editor of The Advocate, died Wednesday of AIDS complications. He was 43.<ep>
   Rouilard, who increased circulation of the United States' oldest major gay magazine from 60,000 to 150,000 during his two-year tenure from 1990 to 1992, died at the West Hollywood home he shared with his companion of 20 years, Robert Cohen.<ep>
   Rouilard, a lawyer turned journalist, was credited with raising the journalistic standards of the biweekly Advocate and adding national public relations panache, increasing the visibility and credibility of both the magazine and the gay and lesbian community that it serves.<ep>
   He published controversial interviews with celebrities such as Madonna and articles dealing with police brutality and suicides of gays. He jokingly threatened to declare California Gov. Pete Wilson ``an honorary homosexual'' for galvanizing the gay and lesbian community by vetoing legislation that would have banned discrimination.<ep>
      Rouilard also is survived by a sister, Beth Olsmit, of Coral Springs.<ql>
