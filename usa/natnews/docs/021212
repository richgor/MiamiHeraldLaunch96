<m0>   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (--) Terry Ewing was late. His plane left in an hour and he was cutting it close. But he couldn't tear himself away from his computer and the hole he had hacked into the security network of Tower Records.<ep>
   He kept poking around, looking for something interesting to take to the hackers' convention. Finally, five minutes before the airport shuttle beeped in front of his apartment, he downloaded a file containing 1,700 credit card numbers.<ep>
   ``I thought, `I'll grab this database and see what's on it that I can use, as sort of a leverage at this hacker convention' (--) to actually be somebody instead of just spouting off a lot of garbage,'' Ewing recalls.<ep>
   ``We didn't expect anyone was watching,'' he says seven months later (--) through an inch of Plexiglas at the Sacramento County Jail. Looking back on it now, with 21 months in federal custody stretching before him, the 21-year-old grins and says, ``Idle hands, I guess.''<ep>
   Idle hands and a ethic that says, ``If your security can't keep me out, it's your own fault.'' Overwhelmingly male and often young, hackers are bright when it comes to technology.<ep>
   But they can be dumb when it comes to reality. They imagine themselves to be invincible.<ep>
<m1>Risks are great<ep>
<m0>   The truth is, most hackers who steal get caught, most intrusions are noticed and the authorities on the other side of that screen are becoming more technically astute (--) and they're serious about prosecuting computer crime. Despite dreams of glory, most hackers don't get media attention, just jail time.<ep>
   Smart, likable and funny, Ewing and his best friend, Michael Kim, are a case in point. They figured if Tower caught them, they'd get some kind of warning, they'd stop and everything would be fine.<ep>
   That's how it might have gone down in the old days. The hacker community grew up in the 1960s and '70s, when the Internet was first being built. In the old days, there really wasn't much of anything there.<ep>
   ``If you dial the clock back a long way, to the '70s, there were systems at MIT that had no access control at all. Anyone would walk up, log in and poke around,'' said Noel Chiappa, one of scientists involved to the Internet's development.<ep>
   It was the golden age of the network, when what are called hackers today were known somewhat affectionately as ``tourists.''<ep>
   Times, however, have changed.<ep>
   ``You've got the older hackers justifying what they've always done, giving these kids a false sense of what the situation is (--) and it's not the same situation,'' said Bill Benton, a Secret Service agent in the agency's financial crimes division in Washington, D.C.<ep>
   Business has come online in a major way in the past three years. The stakes are higher, and the old days of getting nasty e-mail from a system administrator for breaking in are long gone.<ep>
<m1>`Not fun and games'<ep>
<m0>   ``It's not fun and games. There's too much commerce happening online to allow these cases to go unprosecuted,'' said William Portanova, the assistant U.S. district attorney in Sacramento who prosecuted Ewing and Kim.<ep>
   Ewing had had second thoughts about taking the Tower Records file with him on July 31, so he left it on his hard drive while he and Kim hit DefCon, the biggest of the West Coast hacker gatherings, for a weekend of bragging, hanging out and messing around.<ep>
   ``We never guessed they were onto us. Their security was so weak it really blew,'' Kim, 20, says by phone from the sixth floor of the same jail that held his friend. He is facing an 18-month sentence.<ep>
   ``We actually went and took a tour of their corporate offices. We saw where the guy who runs their computer sits, in a little itty-bitty cubicle, and we thought `This guy doesn't know anything.'<ep>
   ``But then,'' he adds, ``we really weren't all that bright either.''<ep>
   Indeed not. According to Kelli O'Neill, an investigator with the Yolo County District Attorney's office, Tower officials knew they were under siege the first time the hackers entered the system.<ep>
   The computer operators Kim had thought so clueless actually rigged it so that every time the duo logged in, beepers alerted Tower to the intrusion. They also set up a program to monitor the hackers' every keystroke.<ep>
   Tower went to the police, who convinced them not to close the security holes but instead wait to see what the hackers would do next.<ep>
   As the case progressed, the police called in the Secret Service, who convinced O'Neill to bump the case to the federal level. It was the first big hacker incident the eastern district of the U.S. Department of Justice had seen, and officials there were eager to make an example of it.<ep>
   ``We wanted to get the word out as far as we could. It seems incomprehensible that sitting in your bedroom pushing little bits of light around on your monitor is going to land you in federal prison (--) well, here's proof it can happen,'' Portanova said.<ep>
<m1>No clue<ep>
<m0>   Seventy miles to the southwest, the duo had no idea there was a spider in their net.<ep>
   They'd rented a small room in a shared apartment in Berkeley. Kim, who was from Los Angeles, was waiting to find out if his applications to the University of California at Berkeley computer science program had been accepted. Ewing, from Pocatello, Idaho, was waiting to establish his California residency so he was eligible for in-state tuition.<ep>
   Both were proficient hackers, but neither viewed himself as a criminal: It was a game.<ep>
   ``We didn't know we'd get in,'' Ewing said of the Tower computer, which controls information for the chain's book, video and record stores worldwide. ``We just got caught in a big `can we do it?' game and it snowballed.''<ep>
   Not quite crime kingpins, the first thing the duo used their computing powers for was to open an account at the Tower video store just up the road (--) which they promptly erased after they rented some movies, to escape the fees.<ep>
   But to set up the account, Kim used their real address. And when Ewing downloaded the file containing the credit cards, that bit of honesty came back to haunt them.<ep>
   ``Somebody remembered that a couple of weeks previous, one of the kids had set up an account for themselves. . . . The [Tower employee] printed out the screen, thinking it might be important later,'' Portanova said.<ep>
<m1>Cards sorted, file created<ep>
<m0>    It was. Because a month later, the hackers finally did something worth looking into: The programmers watched as someone in Berkeley issued a command to sort the credit card numbers by expiration date, then created a separate file containing only those cards with dates at least a year off.<ep>
   This was no hacker trophy to be shown off: It was clear criminal intent.<ep>
   ``What they were doing up to that point was illegal, but they hadn't really risen to a level justifying federal involvement,'' Portanova said.<ep>
   So while Ewing and Kim were hanging out in Las Vegas, agents were busting into their apartment.<ep>
   Under federal law, each ``access device,'' as credit cards are known in legal parlance, is worth $100. The few commands Ewing had typed had resulted in a theft worth $17,000 in the eyes of the law (--) a felony offense.<ep>
   Even though the two never had a chance to do anything with the cards, they still were guilty, despite a hacker myth that says if you don't actually use the numbers you can't be prosecuted.<ep>
   Ewing and Kim turned themselves in and admitted guilt as part of a plea bargain.<ep>
   ``The whole time, we were thinking, `If we just plead guilty, we'll get six months' house arrest' (--) but it didn't work,'' said Kim, a slight young man with wire-framed glasses who looks closer to 17.<ep>
   Both were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and possession of credit card information, and have now been sent to separate federal facilities to serve their time. They are under court order to have no contact with each other and, after they are released, cannot hold jobs where they might have access to credit cards.<ep>
