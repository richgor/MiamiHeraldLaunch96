<m0>   Garth Williams, the artist who illustrated E.B. White's <m0>Stuart Little<m0>  and <m0>Charlotte's Web<m0>  and scores of other children's classics, died Wednesday in Guanajuato, Mexico. He was 84.<ep>
   Generations of children picture their favorite fictional characters as drawn by Williams: that dapper mouse Stuart Little; the kindhearted spider Charlotte and Wilbur the pig; and bears, dogs, kittens, crickets, elves, fairies and children in books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, George Selden, Charlotte Zolotow, Else H. Minarik and oth<m4>Williams<m2><ql>
<m0>ers. Williams also wrote the text for seven books.<ep>
   He said he used his illustrations to try to ``awaken something of importance . . . humor, responsibility, respect for others, interest in the world at large.''<ep>
   Williams' father was a cartoonist, his mother a landscape painter. He first intended to become an architect, then switched to painting and sculpture. He graduated from the Royal Academy of Art in London.<ep>
   Williams also illustrated Laura Ingalls Wilder's <m0>Little House on the Prairie<m0>  and its sequels. In addition, he illustrated books by Margaret Wise Brown, Russell Hoban and Randall Jarrell. Among his most popular books were those written by George Selden, beginning with <m0>The Cricket in Times Square.<m0><ep>
   In 1958, he wrote and illustrated <m0>The Rabbits<m0>' <m0>Wedding,<m0> which became the subject of controversy because it dealt with a marriage between a white rabbit and a black rabbit. <ep>
   For the past 40 years, Williams lived in a hacienda he built in Guanajuato and in his home in San Antonio.<ep>
   He is survived by his wife Leticia, five daughters and a son.<ql>
