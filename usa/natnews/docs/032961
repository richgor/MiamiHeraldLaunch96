   Tim Gullikson, the effervescent tennis coach who helped transform Pete Sampras from an introverted prodigy to a genuine candidate to become one of the greatest champions to play the sport, died Friday. He was 44.<ep>
   Inoperable brain cancer had been diagnosed in Gullikson in January 1995. His family said he died at home in Wheaton, Ill., a suburb of Chicago.<ep>
   His alliance with Sampras, the No. 1-ranked male player in the world and the defending champion of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, was the culmination of a career that began in relative obscurity.<ep>
   ``Today, I lost a dear friend and a coach,'' Sampras said in a statement Friday from his home in Tampa.<ep>
   Timothy Edward Gullikson was born Sept. 8, 1951, in La Crosse, Wis., just minutes after his identical twin brother Tom. They graduated from Northern Illinois University, with Tim earning a degree in physical education.<ep>
   As professional players, the two won 10 doubles titles together and were 1983 finalists at Wimbledon. The Gulliksons were also a top team on senior circuits until last year.<ep>
   In addition to Tom Gullikson, his wife, his 13-year-old son and his 9-year-old daughter, he is survived by his mother, Joyce Gullikson Olson, another brother, Gary, and a sister, Sue Ellen Levinger.<ql>
