   WASHINGTON (--) Craig Johnstone, the State Department's budget chief, was driving to work one day, frustrated that the Clinton administration had to fight fiercely to find $160 million to help build Russian democracy.<ep>
   As he drove, a radio announcer reported that Interstate 66 would get two new car-pool lanes in Virginia at a cost of $150 million. To Johnstone, the news was yet another disheartening reminder of the relentless squeeze on America's foreign spending.<ep>
   ``Just about the same amount of money that we're spending to try and ensure the consolidation of the gains of the Cold War, so you get a sense of where our priorities are,'' Johnstone said. ``This is a very, very small budget.''<ep>
   Spending on American foreign aid and diplomacy has dropped 51 percent since 1984, the State Department says. Specialists say the crunch imperils U.S. diplomacy and limits America's ability to maintain influence, sell products and do the right thing in distant lands.<ep>
   ``Will we continue to work for peace and security in regions of vital importance, or will we ignore threats until they reach our shores?'' Secretary of State Warren Christopher recently asked Congress. ``Will we walk away from our commitments and leave ourselves no option but to face future crises alone?''<ql>
<m1>Spending out of whack<ep>
<m0>   Doomsaying is a budget rite everywhere, especially in these budget-cutting days in Washington. Yet diplomats and other advocates of foreign spending argue that things are out of whack when military spending is 15 times greater than funding for diplomacy and foreign assistance.<ep>
   ``It makes no sense at all for the United States to possess the world's finest military machine, but to let the very diplomatic functions that prevent war and instability wither on the vine,'' J. Brian Atwood, director of the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), told Congress.<ep>
   Atwood's agency, which manages U.S. aid programs, survived a Republican effort to eliminate it this year. But budget cuts will reduce its spending by about $700 million, or 11 percent. The agency has closed 27 missions since 1993 and has cut its staff from 11,500 to 8,700.<ql>

<m1><ep>
<m0>   By the year 2000, the agency will be operating in 75 countries, compared with 120 when the Clinton administration took office, Atwood said. Large-scale programs will be reduced from 43 to 30.<ql>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   Despite the budget cuts, however, Congress has also asked the agency to sustain or expand certain programs.<ep>
   ``Unfortunately,'' Atwood said, ``only an alchemist could meet such demands with such rapidly declining resources.''<ep>
   Republicans who have fueled the recent budget-cutting momentum on Capitol Hill say the United States simply cannot afford the programs favored by many diplomats and aid organizations.<ep>
   ``It's not that I don't care, or that I'm not concerned with people in hot spots,'' said Rep. Mark Neumann, R-Wis., ``but I also recognize that we've got a huge problem here at home to solve. Is it fair to take my children's money and send it overseas? I'd have to answer no.''<ep>
      Neumann, a freshman member of the House Appropriations Committee, said his priorities are clear: ``What the American people sent me here to do is balance the budget.''<ql>
<m1>Spending rationale disappears<ep>
<m0>   The deeply skeptical nature of the recent foreign-policy budget debate reflects a significant change in the way Washington views overseas spending. During the Cold War, when countries virtually unknown to average Americans were seen as battlegrounds against communism, the money flowed. And flowed.<ep>
   Then the Soviet empire collapsed. The instant rationale for foreign spending disappeared. Congress went from the general presumption that budget requests were justified, to the general presumption that they were not.<ep>
   In the salad days of the early 1980s, the United States fought proxy wars in Africa and Central America and spent energetically to win hearts and minds elsewhere.<ep>
   ``The Cold War flew cover for all these budgets,'' said a State Department official.<ep>
   The U.S. spends less per capita on foreign aid than any of the world's 21 most developed countries.<ep>
   Critics say that the Republican-led Congress is slicing hundreds of millions of dollars without considering the implications. They say it is no way for a great power to lead the world.<ep>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees foreign spending, said the international budget will continue to drop despite the foreign-policy establishment.<ep>
   ``I wouldn't expect them to be happy about it. Unfortunately, it's going to be cut, whether I like it or not, or whether they like it or not,'' he said.<ql>
<m1>Perceptions are off<ep>
<m0>   One problem for advocates of foreign spending is that Americans tend to have a dramatically inflated view of the size of the foreign aid budget.<ep>
   A recent University of Maryland poll found that a typical respondent thought that 15 percent of the federal budget is spent on foreign aid. A 1993 Harris survey registered an average estimate of 33 percent.<ep>
   When asked how much should be spent on foreign aid, people told the University of Maryland researchers that 5 percent seemed reasonable.<ep>
   In fact, the foreign aid budget is about half of 1 percent of the $1.6 trillion federal budget. Overall foreign spending (--) which includes foreign aid and money to run the State Department (--) is slightly more than 1 percent, or about $18 billion.<ep>
   U.S. military spending, by comparison, amounts to about $260 billion.<ep>
   David Gordon, who studies the issue for the Overseas Development Council, a group that promotes international investment, says that foreign spending is not simply a handout. Rather, aid helps develop U.S. trade, as well as extend America's strategic reach.<ep>
