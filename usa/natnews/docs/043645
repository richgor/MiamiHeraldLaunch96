<m0>   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (--) (AP) (--) Two Marine helicopters collided in the dark and crashed in a piney swamp Friday during the biggest U.S.-British training exercise in history, killing 14 people. A pilot and co-pilot were seriously injured.<ep>
   The collision involved a CH-46E Sea Knight and an AH-1W Cobra assault helicopter and happened about 2 a.m. in clear weather under a half-moon.<ep>
   Rescue workers had to wade into chest-deep mud and water and cut through the underbrush with chain saws to search for bodies. All the victims were Americans.<ep>
   ``It's in a heavily marshed thick woods, extremely dense underbrush, making it just about impassible by any kind of vehicle,'' said Col. J.C. Yannessa, whose uniform had a water line across the top of his shirt pocket.<ep>
   Crews retrieved all the bodies by 6 p.m. Many were extensively burned by a fire that broke out on impact, a Pentagon official said. Dental records will be needed to identify the remains, he said.<ep>
   It was the worst Marine Corps aviation disaster since a Sea Knight crashed at sea in 1989, killing 14 aboard.<ep>
   ``Our hearts go out to the families, the friends, the loved ones of those who lost their lives,'' President Clinton said.<ep>
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. The Marine Corps said the Cobra's mission was to fly ahead of the larger Sea Knight, a troop transport, to secure a landing zone for it. Once the Sea Knight approached the zone, the Cobra was to swing back around.<ep>
   Camp Lejeune spokesman Maj. Steve Little could not say whether the pilots were using night vision goggles, or describe other conditions on the mock battlefield.<ep>
   Fisherman David Milbourne heard the crash while pulling shrimp nets.<ep>
   ``It sounded a lot like an 18-wheeler crashing into a wall,'' he said. ``I didn't pay much attention because it was late. We had heard helicopters flying overhead all night, but after the noise, everything went silent. It was dead quiet.''<ep>
   The Pentagon official said the two Marines who survived the crash were the pilot and the co-pilot of the CH-46E. The pilot was hospitalized in critical condition with head and chest injuries. The co-pilot was in stable condition.<ep>
   The aircraft were participating in Operation Purple Star, war games involving 38,000 U.S. troops and more than 15,000 British troops assembled off the North Carolina coast this week.<ep>
   As part of the war games, British troops with 27 ships and 57 aircraft are operating with the Americans as a coalition force against the fictitious enemy nation of Korona, whose army ``invaded'' the smaller country of Kartuna.<ep>
   The scenario is meant to replicate a potential crisis in the Persian Gulf. A U.S.-British amphibious assault overnight kicked off the war games.<ep>
   Air operations related to the war games were suspended after the crash but resumed later in the morning.<ep>
