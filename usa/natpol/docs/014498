   WASHINGTON (--) New Jersey Rep. Robert Torricelli, a Democrat seeking a Senate seat, made another fund-raising pilgrimage to Miami last weekend. Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat in an expensive re-election fight, headed south this year in search of cash, too. Even Indiana Congressman Dan Burton, a Republican who prides himself on Hoosier support, made two trips so far this session.<ql>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ep>
<m0>   When it comes to exclusive low-key political fund raising, Florida is fertile ground (--) so much a mecca that for some Northern politicians, the road to Congress seems to cut right through the Sunshine State.<ep>
   ``I haven't met a senator or congressman who is interested in raising money nationally (--) outside of their state or district, outside of Washington (--) who is not interested in going to Florida,'' says political strategist Jonathan Slade, whose clients include the Cuban American National Foundation.<ep>
   ``It's one of the natural places to go to. A lot of them don't want to have to do it, don't want to have to go,'' said Slade. ``Unfortunately, that's the process.''<ep>
   A combination of factors makes South Florida a magnet for candidates seeking cash:<ep>
   <m0>Money: <m0>As Florida's population grows, so do many donors' businesses and pocketbooks. Many are year-round residents, entrepreneurs and investors, but some have northern addresses as well. And a lot have special interests, from love of Israel to loathing for Fidel Castro, which fuel special donations.<ep>
   <m0>Personalities: <m0>Several of America's best, largely behind-the-scenes political fund-raisers live in South Florida. They include Dade Democrat Jerry Berlin, a caterer and banquet hall owner, and Fort Lauderdale Republican Zachariah ``Zach'' Zachariah, a cardiologist who collected more $1,000 individual contributions for George Bush's 1992 campaign than any other fund-raiser.<ep>
   <m0>Climate: <m0>Fund-raising efforts focus on the winter months, when the weather in Washington is far less hospitable than the beaches and golf courses of Florida. Besides, some members of Congress already have holiday homes in the region (--) from Bob Dole's Bal Harbour getaway to the former Kennedy estate in Palm Beach.<ep>
   <m0>Kin: <m0>Everyone seems to have family or friends in Florida (--) from California Sen. Barbara Boxer, whose daughter is married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, to California Gov. Pete Wilson's dad. If not full-time Floridians, some are ``snowbirds,'' such as Elaine and Jerry Schuster of Massachusetts and Palm Beach, who threw a Florida fund-raiser for Kerry in February.<ep>
   ``There are people down here raising money all the time (--) on both sides,'' says Dante Fascell, a Miami lawyer and Democrat who served in Congress for 38 years. ``It's hard to pick a specific time frame or date when Florida transformed itself as far as politics is concerned because there are so many building blocks in making that change.''<ep>
   How big a phenomenon is it? Because fund raising is often done in the shadows, it is hard to count how often congressional candidates shuttle south in search of funds to fuel their campaigns.<ep>
<m0>Golden zip codes<ep>
<m0>   But, says Ellen Miller of the Center for Responsive Politics, which studies fund-raising trends: ``There is no question that Miami is one of the centers where candidates go for money. We call them `The golden zip codes.' ''<ep>
   According to the center, Florida ranked seventh in the nation (--) behind New York, California, Texas, Illinois, New Jersey and Massachusetts (--) in terms of top individual contributions for congressional campaigns in 1995. The Florida total: $4,134,644.<ep>
   Palm Beach's pricey zip code (--) 33480 (--) ranked 17th in the nation, contributing $260,275, a Center for Responsive Politics study found. Three Dade zip codes combined (--) 33156, 33133 and 33131 (--) contributed $343,830. Together all four totaled $604,105 (--) nearly twice the total contributed in Beverly Hills' famous zip code of 90210.<ep>
   South Floridians are familiar with the high-profile events, such as President Clinton's recent $1,500-a-plate dinner at Coral Gables' Biltmore Hotel. But smaller, more private events are frequently held far from the public eye, for example at the homes of Berlin and Zachariah, party activists familiar in national fund-raising circles.<ep>
   ``What really makes it difficult is when one of the sitting governors or one of the sitting senators will call you (--) and you have to decide whether to take his or her phone call,'' said Zachariah, national co-chairman of the Bob Dole For President Finance Committee.<ep>
   ``You don't want to say `no' to them,'' he explained. ``So sometimes you just don't take the call. Or you just send $1,000 to get them off your back.''<ep>
<m0>`There's money here'<ep>
<m0>   Zachariah, who estimates he is asked to host two or three events a month, has held recent fund-raisers for Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, who is challenging Kerry, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico (--) all Republicans.<ep>
   But why South Florida?<ep>
   ``Because they think there's money here. And they must be right. They're still coming back,'' said the doctor.<ep>
   Political insiders describe a circuit of sorts for senators and House members waging costly races that are mostly unfamiliar to South Florida, where members like Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Carrie Meek often run unopposed.<ep>
   Insiders say the business of traveling in search of funds at small gatherings (--) in private homes, hotels, exclusive clubs (--) started in earnest in the early 1980s when campaign finance laws changed and Congress discovered the concept of ``the national constituency.''<ep>
   Burton of Indiana is a case in point.<ep>
   Some support comes from South Floridians who admire the seven-term congressman's sponsorship of Congress' ``Libertad'' legislation, which seeks to suffocate Cuba's economy. For months it was called The Helms-Burton Act.<ep>
   ``The congressman still does most of his fund raising in the state of Indiana and the Midwest,'' says Burton aide Kevin Binger. ``But Congressman Burton has been active with the Cuban population and there is obviously a large Cuban population in southern Florida.''<ep>
   That's just one explanation for the trend.<ep>
   ``It's part of the national circuit: New York, Florida, Chicago and California. There's probably at least a dozen people running for the U.S. Senate who are making that four-state tour,'' says Larry Weitzner, campaign manager for New Jersey Rep. Dick Zimmer, a pro-Israel Republican who is competing with Torricelli for Sen. Bill Bradley's seat.<ep>
   ``Quite a few people grew up and worked in New Jersey and moved down to Florida who have supported him in the past and wanted to support him in the future,'' says Weitzner.<ep>
<m0>Poaching on donations?<ep>
<m0>   Whatever the reason, Rep. Peter Deutsch, Democrat from Lauderhill, said the phenomenon is proof positive that ``we're a major urban center, we're a large metropolitan area, with all four major sports teams.''<ep>
   But does he see it as poaching on political donations that could stay in the state?<ep>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Orlando, who says Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah raises money regularly in Orlando, believes some Floridians would like to use the out-of-state phenomenon as leverage for legislation that would benefit Florida or ``help us get our fair share of the pie.''<ep>
   Deutsch sees it a bit differently.<ep>
   ``I don't really see it as a problem,'' he said. ``I don't think there's `X' amount of dollars in South Florida to raise and that if some people get it, other people won't.<ep>
   ``It's a very good thing for South Florida. I don't believe enough people are involved in the political process both in time and money (--) and you need to be involved and influence policy.''<ql>
