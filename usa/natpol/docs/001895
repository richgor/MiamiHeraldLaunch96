   WASHINGTON (--) A pledge by the major TV networks of free air time for presidential candidates this fall was greeted as good news across the political spectrum, even though analysts were divided over its impact on the campaign.<ep>
   ``I've always thought that the more people learned about the candidates and about the issues, the better it was, the more intelligent a vote they would cast,'' longtime GOP consultant Charles Black said Wednesday, as ABC became the sixth network to offer free time to major presidential candidates.<ep>
   Black said the proposal should be the most advantageous to a challenger, although he conceded that prospective GOP nominee Bob Dole comes across as less polished on television than President Clinton.<ep>
   But, he said, ``anything that gets people to hear messages about issues and focus on the issues is good for Dole.''<ep>
   In general terms, free TV time might help challengers, agreed Paul Begala, a Democratic consultant who worked in Clinton's 1992 campaign, but ``that will change from year to year as the candidates change.''<ep>
   ``In this cycle it probably helps Clinton, because he has more talent as a candidate,'' he added.<ep>
<m0>Different formats<ep>
<m0>   ABC said it would air a one-hour prime-time special during the final week of the campaign.<ep>
   ABC President David Westin said the event would be ``unstructured,'' and that the candidates ``would discuss with each other, and the American people, the issues they believe to be the most important in the election.''<ep>
   CBS, NBC, CNN, the Public Broadcasting Service and Fox previously said they would make time available, although the formats were all different. Most said they would offer the candidates segments of up to five minutes during newscasts or prime-time news programs. Fox offered an hour on election eve.<ep>
   In all cases, the time would be given to the candidates to address the nation without interruption.<ep>
   ``It means the candidates will have more of an opportunity to reach anyone who wants to listen unfiltered by journalists or others,'' said Steven Hess, a scholar who specializes on the presidency and the media at the Brookings Institution.<ep>
   ``But having said that, I would doubt that it would have any major impact,'' he added. Since none of the free air times will be simultaneous, viewers who don't want to hear the candidates could simply switch channels, Hess said.<ep>
   Sharon Holman, a spokeswoman for Ross Perot and his new Reform Party, said the commitments by the networks ``falls in with campaign finance reform'' that Perot is advocating.<ep>
   Perot spent $60 million of his own money on his independent 1992 campaign, much of it on television spots similar to those the networks are now offering free.<ep>
   ``Anything we can do to balance the playing field is positive,'' Holman said. She said she expected the Reform Party candidate (--) whether it is Perot or someone else (--) to be included in the free air time.<ep>
   But Stuart Rothenberg, an analyst who publishes a political newsletter, said he's skeptical.<ep>
   ``I suspect that what we're going to see is just more political spin from the candidates. Like a series of positive political ads. I don't think it's going to change things dramatically.''<ep>
<m0>Clinton welcomes free time<ep>
<m0>   The free-time announcements follow a campaign by the nonprofit Free TV for Straight Talk Coalition, founded by former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite and former Washington Post political reporter Paul Taylor.<ep>
   They originally proposed that the networks give the candidates from two to five minutes a night for the final month of the campaign (--) to be aired simultaneously.<ep>
   On Wednesday, Taylor welcomed the fact that all the networks had responded to the plea, even if not completely as he had hoped. ``It's an acknowledgement that something is broken in the way political communication happens on television. And it's encouraging that these are well-intentioned efforts to fix it.''<ep>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the president ``has always been an advocate of free TV time'' and the move by the networks should ``elevate the quality of the debate this fall.''<ep>
