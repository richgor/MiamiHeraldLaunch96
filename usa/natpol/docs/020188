   All major television networks except ABC have now agreed to offer free time for presidential candidates to state their views this fall, and ABC is expected to announce a plan today.<ep>
   NBC and CNN announced plans Tuesday, following CBS' announcement Monday that it would make time available within its newscasts.<ep>
   NBC, like CBS, said the candidates would be given the time on its news programs, ranging from <m0>Today <m0>to the <m0>Nightly News <m0>to <m0>Dateline.<m0> CNN, like Fox Television, agreed to provide the time during the peak viewing hours, between 8 and 11 p.m.<ep>
   The networks have been prodded by a public-interest coalition that includes Walter Cronkite, and then by Rupert Murdoch, the head of Fox, who announced in February that he would offer free time.<ep>
   Cronkite and others argue that free time for candidates to seriously discuss issues will help to reduce the effect of big money and corrosive negative advertising.<ep>
