   WASHINGTON (--) Tired of presidential candidates doing nothing but attacking each other? Frustrated by 30-second commercials that gloss over national problems? There might be something a little different this fall.<ep>
   On Wednesday, ABC became the sixth television network to offer free air time to major presidential candidates, unfiltered by questions or instant commentary from reporters.<ep>
   Although the offers range in time and format (--) from five minutes a week on CNN to an hour on ABC (--) all are designed to change the course of American politics, a course of increasingly negative attacks and sound bites that have left millions of citizens turned off and tuned out.<ep>
   ``Maybe, just maybe, this new voluntary format will drown out those negative ads that turn off so many citizens,'' wrote former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite in an article for USA Today this week.<ep>
   ``Maybe it will increase voter participation. It might even chip away at the cynicism rampant in our political culture,'' said Cronkite, one of a group of journalists, politicians, academics and others who prodded the networks for months to offer the free time.<ep>
   They want the free air time to help Americans get more and better information from candidates for president. They say that has grown difficult, if not impossible, as politicians use 30-second television commercials to make their case, as they spend more and more time attacking their rivals, and as television news itself condenses coverage into shorter and shorter stories.<ep>
   One example: During this year's Republican primaries, viewers watching ABC, CBS or NBC saw the average quote from a candidate reduced to 7.2 seconds. Cronkite notes that television viewers saw the network reporters six times as much as they saw the candidates.<ep>
   A generation ago, in 1968, the average television coverage of a presidential candidate talking was 42 seconds.<ep>
<m0>More direct communication<ep>
<m0>   ``This should enable candidates to deliver whole sentences, complete thoughts or even paragraphs directly to voters,'' said Ann Lewis, deputy campaign manager for President Clinton.<ep>
   ``That's how we communicate with one another all the time. Yet in a decision as important as picking a president, we have less and less direct communication.''<ep>
   Though there is no assurance that candidates won't use the time to attack one another as they do in their paid commercials, supporters hope that politicians will be reluctant to attack when their own face is on the TV screen. Most attack ads are voiced by announcers or surrogates, lest the attacking politician look mean.<ep>
   ``We hope there will be provisos requiring a candidate to appear himself or herself during the entire spot,'' said Ellen Hume, a media scholar at the Annenberg Center for Communications. ``If the candidate has to appear during the entire spot, they're less likely to use ad hominen attacks.''<ep>
   Hume and others point to last year's face-to-face forum between Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich in New Hampshire. With no one else moderating or getting between them, the two antagonists talked amiably about public policy.<ep>
<m0>Offers are different<ep>
<m0>   The network offers all are different, and not all would allow face-to-face debating. ABC offered Wednesday to let ``major candidates'' debate, without questions from anyone else, during a free hour of prime time during the last week before the November election. The time would be offered to Clinton, Sen. Bob Dole, and probably Ross Perot if he runs.<ep>
   CBS offered to air taped, 90-second statements from the candidates during its morning and evening news programs. CNN offered candidates five minutes a week for the last four weeks of the campaign, to be aired on its <m0>Inside Politics<m0>  program. NBC offered unspecified time on its news programs during the last 60 days of the campaign, including <m0>Dateline NBC,<m0>  the prime-time program that appears four times a week.<ep>
   The Fox network is offering the major candidates 10 one-minute spots in the fall, followed by a half hour each during prime time on election eve. PBS also has offered unspecified free air time.<ep>
   Hume said the candidates' representatives will meet with the networks in about two weeks to work out details.<ep>
