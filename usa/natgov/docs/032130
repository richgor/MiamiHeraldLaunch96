<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) Senate Democrats conceded Monday that a temporary repeal of the 1993 gasoline tax increase is unavoidable, and Republican leaders prepared to tap the nation's savings institutions to pay for it.<ep>
   Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said the Senate could vote as soon as today on the tax cut, which he proposed less than two weeks ago. He planned to discuss the timing, as well as a Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage, with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.<ep>
   ``We think [it] is inevitable,'' Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters. Republicans are ``in the majority. They have the votes to pass legislation.''<ep>
   The leading proposal for paying for the cut, according to House and Senate aides, was separate legislation that strengthens the government fund insuring savings and loan deposits.<ep>
   That plan requires a one-time premium payment from S&Ls, and, under budget rules, the money can be used to offset the tax cut. GOP leaders also are looking at a cut in Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's travel budget.<ep>
   The Clinton administration supports the S&L legislation, and Daschle said he is ``not necessarily averse'' to using it to cut the gas tax.<ep>
   Republican leaders are pushing hard for the repeal, seen as having wide popular appeal. Dole, Clinton's rival in the presidential race, notes repeatedly that the tax increase was approved ``without a single Republican vote.''<ep>
   Many Democrats are criticizing the tax cut, saying it could amount to a windfall for the oil companies who pay the tax and ultimately pass it on to the consumer. And environmentalists maintain the tax cut would encourage more energy consumption and hurt the environment.<ep>
   However, some Democrats feel compelled to vote for the tax cut, and Republicans are near unanimous in backing it.<ep>
   At the White House, spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton wanted the tax cut considered as part of a balanced budget. But that doesn't mean Clinton had decided to veto the tax cut.<ep>
   ``If it comes to us separately, we'll look at it separately,'' McCurry said. ``We would hope that the Congress would give equal priority treatment to raising the minimum wage.''<ql>
