<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) President Clinton warily lauded Republicans Thursday for edging toward his fiscal priorities as a pair of congressional committees neared approval of new GOP budget-balancing plans.<ep>
   Amid verbal fusillades fired by lawmakers of both parties, the House and Senate budget committees debated election-year blueprints for fiscal 1997 that pledged $122 billion in tax cuts and about $700 billion in savings, enough to end annual federal deficits by 2002.<ep>
   As in last year's stalemated budget duel with Clinton, Republicans would trim taxes and rein in spending for Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and scores of other domestic programs more deeply than the president wants. But eager to defuse Democratic accusations that they were again heartlessly axing programs for the elderly, children, the poor and the environment, Republicans moderated some of their proposals.<ep>
   ``Key changes are proposed to shrink the federal bureaucracy,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``But at the same time, we continue to support programs which provide needed services to our citizens, and we have been painstakingly careful to preserve a safety net for those in need.''<ep>
   The congressional budget does not need Clinton's signature and is a nonbinding guide for later legislation that will make tax and spending changes. But it allows Republicans to banner their vision of government.<ep>
   ``Well, I'm encouraged that they moved,'' Clinton told reporters, acknowledging the Republican shift.<ep>
   But Clinton still complained about proposals to cut the projected growth of Medicare, to <m1> <m0>let states limit Medicaid coverage, to cut some education and environmental protection programs and to kill his national service program.<ep>
   The GOP would save $158 billion over six years from Medicare, $72 billion from Medicaid, and about $70 billion from welfare and the earned income tax credit for low-wage earners. All are deeper than Clinton wants.<ep>
   Republicans' initial tax-cutting effort would focus on providing a $500 per child tax credit for most children age 13 or under.<ep>
   GOP leaders say they would find savings to finance a cut in the capital gains tax rate and to cut the gasoline tax by 4.3 cents.<ep>
