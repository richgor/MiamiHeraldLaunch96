<m4> TEXT DIVIDED INTO 1 LEG(S) (--)(--) LEG MEASURE SET TO  23p2 <m2><ql>
<m4> BEGIN LEG #1 <m1>    <m0>Congress is moving to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax hike it imposed on gasoline in 1993 to help cut the federal budget deficit. Questions and answers:<ue5><m2><ql>

<m4> TEXT DIVIDED INTO 2 LEG(S) (--)(--) LEG MEASURE SET TO  11p1 <m2><ql>
<m4> BEGIN LEG #1 <m1><ep>
<m0>   Q: Would a repeal cut gasoline prices immediately?<ep>
<m0>   A: Probably, but there's no guarantee. Gasoline prices are set by complex market forces. Cutting the tax reduces one cost to suppliers. But if other supply costs rise, that could offset the repeal and leave prices unchanged or even rising.<ep>
<m0>   Q: When will the repeal take effect?<ep>
<m0>   A: Six days after enactment of the bill, through Dec. 31. Republican leaders in Congress hope to have a bill to President Clinton by Memorial Day.<ep>
<m0>   Q: If prices go down after Memorial Day, how will we know whether it was because of the tax cut or because prices would have gone down anyway?<ep>
<m0>   A: We won't.<ep>
<m0>   Q: Did the 1993 tax hike cause this spring's gasoline price spike?<ep>
<m0>   A: No. Prices jumped this spring for other reasons.<ep>
   Global oil production was lower than expected because of weather-related problems in the North Sea and Mexico. The unusually harsh winter delayed refiners from shifting their mix to gasoline from fuel oil as much as usual and as soon as usual.<ep>
   Refiners also had kept inventories lean in expectation that new Iraqi oil supplies would cut global prices by now.<ep>
   Three California refineries were shut down temporarily. And California air-pollution regulators recently ordered more expensive, less-polluting gasoline to be used there.<ep>
   In addition, gasoline prices usually rise a few cents in spring <m4> BEGIN LEG #2 <m0>as suppliers build inventories for summer. Weather-related and refinery-breakdown problems are now over.<ep>
<m0>   Q: Are retail prices still rising?<ep>
<m0>   A: They are leveling off and expected to fall soon. Prices for contracts promising gasoline and oil deliveries this summer have fallen nearly 20 percent since peaking in mid-April; retail prices typically follow such ``spot market'' trends within weeks. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Q: Will repeal of the 1993 gasoline tax hike hurt the deficit?<ep>
<m0>   A: It will cost the Treasury $2.9 billion through Dec. 31. Republicans propose to offset that loss by cutting the Department of Energy's budget by $800 million and by selling portions of the broadcast spectrum. GOP leaders also were considering tapping an insurance fund for savings-and-loans to avoid worsening the deficit.<ep>
<m0>   Q: Will President Clinton go along?<ep>
<m0>   A: Yes, as will many Democrats who supported the tax in 1993, because repeal is believed to be popular politically, and this is an election year.<ep>
<m0>   Q: Is this wise public policy?<ep>
<m0>   A: Many conservatives believe it is always wise to cut taxes. But many economists and environmentalists note that cutting the fuel tax gives an incentive to consume more gasoline. That increases U.S. dependence on foreign oil and encourages people to drive gas guzzlers, such as four-wheel-drive vehicles.<ep>
