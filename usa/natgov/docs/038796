<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) Plenty of golfers would love to play a round with President Clinton, a dream made possible in spirited three-way bidding that raised an eye-popping $76,000 at a weekend auction for the school attended by the president's daughter.<ep>
   The Saturday night auction raised money for student scholarships to the Sidwell Friends School, where Chelsea Clinton is a high school junior.<ep>
   The White House would not identify the winning bidder Sunday, and there was no answer at the Sidwell Friends auction office.<ep>
   Parents of students, alumni or others connected with the school were allowed to bid. The golf game for four, one of 35 items offered, had an opening bid of $1,000, said auctioneer Bob Levey. He said the price accelerated in $1,000 bursts.<ep>
   One bidder was Robert Johnson, head of Black Entertainment Television and father of two Sidwell students. Johnson bid up to $75,000 and then gave in. <ep>
   Clinton left the auction well before the bidding began on his golf game, then attended the 82nd annual dinner of the White House Correspondents Association, where he joked that the round of golf was ``not bought by the ambassador from Iran.''<ep>
   Recalling astronomical prices paid for memorabilia from the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Clinton feigned disappointment that the round of golf didn't raise as much money as he'd hoped.<ep>
