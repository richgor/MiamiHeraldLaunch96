<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) Election year gridlock gripped the Senate on Tuesday as the two parties struggled for advantage on Majority Leader Bob Dole's call for a rollback of the federal gasoline tax and the Democrats' demand to raise the minimum wage.<ep>
   ``We're obviously in a situation now where nothing is going to get <m4>Dole  <m2><ql>
<m0>done,'' Democratic leader Tom Daschle said after more than 30 minutes of sparring on the Senate floor with Dole, the prospective GOP presidential nominee.<ep>
   Six months before Election Day, presidential politics hovered over the debate.<ep>
   Dole charged President Clinton and the Democrats with doing the bidding of ``labor bosses'' in opposing legislation to change certain workplace rules.<ep>
   ``I thought certainly he'd be flexible on something like this. Probably is,'' Dole said in a jab at Clinton's consistency, or lack of it, on other issues.<ep>
   The White House circulated a three-page paper that accused Dole of ``hypocrisy'' on taxes. By his prior votes, it said, the Kansas Republican supported increases in the gasoline tax, as well as hikes in the Social Security payroll tax that took place in eight successive years.<ep>
   The Senate has been at loggerheads for weeks over Democratic demands to raise the $4.25-an-hour minimum wage by 90 cents over two years.<ep>
   Dole has gone to extraordinary lengths to thwart an up-or-down vote on that issue, but he and the Republicans have been forced onto the defensive. <ep>
   The only vote of the day came when Republicans fell short of the 60 votes needed to choke off debate on legislation to pay the legal bills of seven workers fired in the White House travel office affair three years ago.<ep>
   Democrats are blocking the measure (--) as they have others (--) because Dole won't permit them a vote on the minimum wage. The 52-44 vote against choking off debate fell along party lines.<ep>
   Ten days ago, Dole proposed repealing a 4.3-cent-a-gallon hike in the gasoline tax that Clinton and the Democrats pushed through in 1993, a politically appealing proposal given the sharp rise in gasoline prices in recent months.<ep>
   The gas tax bill Dole attempted to push through the Senate would be effective through Dec. 31. He would offset the $2.9 billion cost with an $800 million cut in the Department of Energy's administrative budget and with the proceeds from the auction of unused portions of the broadcast spectrum.<ep>
   The Senate struggle unfolded as Majority Leader Dick Armey said a vote on the minimum wage would take place in the House later this summer.<ep>
