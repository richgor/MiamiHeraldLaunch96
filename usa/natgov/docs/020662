<m0>   ROCK POINT, Md. (--) (AP) (--) After an eight-day search involving divers, dogs and sonar equipment, the body of former CIA Director William Colby was found face down in a marshy riverbank Monday, near where he disappeared on a canoe outing.<ep>
   Authorities said the 76-year-old retired spy master was probably alive when he fell into the water and suffered hypothermia and drowned. There were no marks on the body to indicate foul play, Sheriff Fred Davis said.<ep>
   ``There is nothing unusual about this case at all,'' he said.<ep>
   Colby, whose family owns a waterfront vacation home in this southern Maryland town, had been missing since April 27, when he told his wife by phone that he was going canoeing. She was out of town at the time.<ep>
   His body was found on a secluded spit of beach about a half-mile from his home, 100 yards downstream of where his swamped canoe was discovered a day after he disappeared. No life jacket was found with the body.<ep>
   Colby's wife, Sally Shelton-Colby, identified the body, clad in khaki pants, a red windbreaker, a blue and white shirt and no shoes. She said her husband customarily kept the life jacket in the canoe but didn't wear it.<ep>
