<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) Overriding Democratic objections of election-year politics, House Republicans pressed ahead Wednesday with plans to investigate the Clinton administration's role in allowing Iran to ship arms to the Bosnian government.<ep>
   By a largely party-line vote of 224-187, the House created an eight-member select subcommittee to carry out the probe.<ep>
   The subcommittee of the House International Relations Committee will be made up of five Republicans and three Democrats and have a $995,000 budget to carry out its six-month investigation.<ep>
   Democrats pointed out that the select subcommittee is scheduled to complete its work a week before Election Day.<ep>
   ``This select committee is not only completely unnecessary but also completely political,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas. He said the probe would provide ``one million dollars of work for the Dole presidential campaign.''<ep>
   The Democrats argued that any probe ought to be carried out by existing committees. Creating a select subcommittee gives the panel its own budget to carry out the investigation.<ep>
   Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Miami Republican, said Congress has a responsibility to investigate the administration ``secretly giving a green light to the arming of the Bosnians by one of the most horrendous enemies of the American people.''<ep>
   The White House has said it will cooperate with an investigation of the decision to allow Iranian arms shipments to go to Bosnia through Croatia in 1994 when a U.N. embargo against arms shipments was in effect. Administration officials have said that the Croatian government was told the United States would have no objection to the shipments.<ep>
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, officials have said that President Clinton personally approved sending that message to Croatia.<ep>
   Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, the senior Democrat on the International Relations Committee, argued that there was no need to create a select subcommittee to carry out the investigation.<ep>
   ``Many members knew about the arms shipments at the time and they did not protest,'' said Hamilton, who pointed out that three other House committees (--) including the full International Relations Committee (--) are investigating the incident as well.<ep>
