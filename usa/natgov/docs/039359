   WASHINGTON (--) Republicans talk darkly of a ``foolish and deceitful'' policy. Democrats counter that the Republicans are playing ``desperation politics'' in an election year.<ep>
   To sort it out will cost at least $995,000, the House decided Wednesday when it voted to investigate President Clinton's tacit approval of Iranian arms shipments to Bosnia.<ep>
   The 224-187 vote, almost exactly along party lines, means House Republicans will be poking a stick at the president's Bosnia policy until the eve of November's presidential election.<ep>
   It means subpoenas, public hearings and weighty questions about what the White House intended in April 1994 when it essentially flashed a green light to Iran, despite a United Nations arms embargo.<ep>
   Iran delivered tons of weapons to Croatia and the besieged Muslim-led government of Bosnia, then fighting for its life against more powerful Serbian forces. The shipments fueled a dramatic counterattack last year that helped force the Serbs to make peace.<ep>
   Republicans charge that the White House was wrong to give quiet assent to the Iranians when the U.N. embargo was in force and when the administration was declaring publicly that it opposed efforts to arm the Bosnians.<ep>
   They charge that the administration should have moved more quickly to notify Congress, the Pentagon and the CIA. The Republicans also contend that the policy wrongly permitted Iran, a bitter U.S. foe, to become more deeply involved in Bosnia.<ep>
   ``Behind the scenes,'' Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said Wednesday, ``the president was allowing a terrorist state to send weapons underground to another embargoed country. That sounds like unethical behavior at the very least.''<ep>
   Unlike the Reagan administration's illegal arms-for-hostages activities, which led to deep embarrassment and criminal convictions, there is no suggestion from either camp on Capitol Hill that the Clinton administration broke any laws.<ep>
   At a time when at least three Republican-controlled committees are asking questions about the Iranian arms pipeline, Democrats railed against the creation of a special committee to be chaired by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.<ep>
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., described it Wednesday as ``spending a million dollars . . . to try to get the president.'' Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., called it ``desperation politics.''<ep>
   The Democrats portray the Clinton administration's decision as a difficult choice among unsavory options. They say the Iranians' role was hardly secret, since The Washington Post wrote its first front-page story about the issue more than two years ago.<ep>
   Democrats also point out that Republican leaders had publicly demanded that the United States should abandon the arms embargo and help Bosnia defend itself. Shortly after Clinton's decision not to oppose Iranian shipments, Congress passed a resolution calling on the White House to help arm the Bosnians.<ep>
