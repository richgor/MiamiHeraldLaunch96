<m0>4-year `buyout' round on Clinton agenda<ql>

<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) The Clinton administration will urge Congress to approve a four-year ``buyout'' program that would allow federal agencies faced with budget cuts to avert layoffs by offering cash bonuses to employees willing to quit or retire early, senior officials say.<ep>
   The proposed legislation, if approved, would represent the second time that non-defense agencies have been granted the right to offer buyouts as part of a government-wide program. More than 32,000 federal workers took buyouts when they were offered from March 1994 to March 1995, giving the administration a jump on its downsizing initiative while avoiding mass firings at agencies.<ep>
   The terms of the buyouts would be different in the proposed second round, however. They would be tied to each agency's jobs cuts, rather than government-wide downsizing goals, and would include an enforcement mechanism to ensure that agencies eliminated fully staffed jobs as opposed to unfilled slots.<ep>
   Instead of offering a standard amount of $25,000, as agencies did in the first round, the proposed legislation stipulates that cash bonuses would be worth more when the buyout window opened than when it was about to close: up to $25,000 would be offered in fiscal years 1996 and 1997; up to $20,000 in fiscal 1998; up to $15,000 in 1999, and up to $10,000 in 2000.<ep>
   The proposal represents a turnabout for administration officials, who said last year they did not think another round of buyouts would be needed, since the government is on schedule to cut 272,900 jobs by the end of 1999. But President Clinton recently agreed with the Republican-controlled Congress to move toward a balanced budget early in the next century, virtually ensuring that most federal agencies will face three to five years of constant budget pressure.<ep>
   John A. Koskinen, deputy director for management at OMB, said Wednesday that the President's Management Council, a group of senior officials from Cabinet departments and major agencies, strongly supports the new buyout proposal. ``They have made it clear over the last several months that this is an important tool that they need to manage effectively through the next three or four years,'' he said.<ep>
