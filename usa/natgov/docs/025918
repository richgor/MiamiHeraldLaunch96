   WASHINGTON (--) Sparring with his Republican opponent Wednesday, President Clinton said for the first time that he would sign a GOP-backed bill repealing his 1993 tax increase of 4.3 cents per gallon of gasoline.<ep>
   But Clinton insisted that Congress also should pass a Democrat-backed bill raising the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 over two years. He stressed that if Congress passed both measures separately and ``clean'' (--) without other provisions (--) he would sign them and, thus, break a ``logjam'' on Capitol Hill.<ep>
   Preaching high-minded bipartisanship, Clinton challenged Congress to follow that ``clean'' approach for 90 days and pass a raft of pending bills on everything from welfare reform and health insurance to doubling the size of the Border Patrol.<ep>
   He would sign them all, the president said (--) so long as they were tailored to his specifications and shorn of GOP refinements, which Clinton termed ``poison pills.''<ep>
   Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the GOP presidential nominee-in-waiting, watched Clinton's White House pressroom performance on television, then matched it with one of his own from the Senate TV gallery.<ep>
   Dole's tone was dismissive from the start.<ep>
   ``Well, I've had the opportunity to watch President Clinton in his bipartisan or whatever statement on cooperation from Congress,'' the Kansas senator began, then blamed Clinton for blocking a balanced budget, welfare reform, tax cuts and pension reform.<ep>
   ``And all of these issues, I can tell the president, remain priorities for the Republican Congress,'' Dole said.<ep>
   As for Clinton's talk about breaking a ``logjam,'' Dole advised him to consult Democratic leaders in Congress, whom Dole blamed for causing all the trouble.<ep>
   What about GOP poison pills?<ep>
   ``We think what we've offered him is good medicine,'' Dole said.<ep>
   Clinton, cruising toward the fall campaign with polls showing him consistently 20 points ahead of Dole, wants to win public favor by calling for bipartisan moderation, which he then defines on his own terms.<ep>
   Dole, trying to sharpen distinctions between himself and Clinton, is hoping his leadership credentials will look more impressive if Congress passes bills bearing a strong GOP stamp, even if Clinton vetoes them.<ep>
   Dole has been trying to package the GOP gas-tax cut with the Democratic minimum-wage increase. Both measures enjoy bipartisan support because both are seen as highly popular with voters in this election year.<ep>
   Lately, Dole has tried to add a third measure to the package (--) a labor-law change that unions oppose. It would permit employers to organize worker-management circles to discuss common problems without the involvement of union leaders. Democrats call that provision a ``union buster'' and have blocked Senate progress on all three measures all week because of it.<ep>
   Dole suggested Democrats are tools of ``the labor bosses'' and chided them for mounting filibusters against the very bills (--) the gas-tax repeal and minimum-wage hike (--) they said they supported.<ep>
   Senate Democrats accused Dole of partisan mischief.<ep>
   ``We are simply going to shut this place down,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, ``until we're given the opportunity to offer our own amendments and debate these issues.''<ep>
