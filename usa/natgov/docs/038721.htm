   WASHINGTON -- The elegant town house in a historic block near the Capitol is a busy place this election year. A couple of times a week, lawmakers stroll over from their offices at breakfast, lunch or cocktail hour to meet with lobbyists.<P>

   The host is United Parcel Service, whose political action committee doled out $3.5 million to federal candidates over the past three years -- more than any other special interest PAC.<P>

   The company multiplies its clout by maintaining the private town house to host fund-raisers and hold quiet talks with those it is seeking to influence.<P>

   With the conversation comes a check for as much as $4,500.<P>

   ``It's our way to have a more personal chance to spend time with the member,'' UPS spokeswoman Gina Ellrich said. ``It allows a chance to talk about our business with a member, and for them to get a chance to understand it in a different setting. It's convenient.''<P>

Easy access<P>

   The gray brick two-story town house, on a shaded street just three blocks from the Capitol, has a brass porch lantern next to its natural oak front door. Pots of geraniums decorate the black wrought-iron front porch.<P>

   While it is not talked about openly, at least a dozen companies or lobbyists maintain similar facilities on Capitol Hill where they can huddle with legislators and raise money for them.<P>

   The others include Beneficial Finance; the lobbying and law firm of Williams & Jensen; sporting goods manufacturer Nike; lobbyist Tommy Boggs and the state of Florida. Florida's Victorian house is also used by corporate sponsors such as AT&T and CSX, and by lobbying firms such as the Jefferson Group.<P>

   The American Trucking Associations use the conference room in their Capitol Hill headquarters frequently for events. The lobbying firm Dutko and Associates has a rooftop deck that can be used for fund-raising.<P>

   The practice has been going on quietly for a long time, said one prominent lobbyist, who didn't want to be identified for fear of alienating colleagues.<P>

   ``The deal is not giving the thousand dollars. The deal is how much you get credit for'' hosting a fund-raiser, he said. ``If you have the space, a member can just walk over for breakfast or whatever. They are nice little quiet getaways, they're not going to be seen by anybody.''<P>

Alternative schmoozing<P>

   Such events are likely to become more common, lobbyists say, in light of stricter gift rules that prevent another form of schmoozing: the lobbyist-paid lunch or golf outing.<P>

   If lobbyists want an away-from-the-office audience now, they must do it in the context of a political fund-raiser.<P>

   ``More and more, if you want members to come to your reception, you'd better have it up there (near the Capitol), because they're too busy to come downtown,'' said Timothy May, managing partner of the lobbying firm Patton Boggs.<P>

   Beneficial spokesman Gary Perkinson said the fund-raising arrangements are appreciated by lawmakers. ``At some point they say, `This is nice of Beneficial to let us use this.' It's part of doing business, and it's a pure convenience for everybody.''<P>

Hefty contributions<P>

   Rep. Paul Gillmor, R-Ohio, went to the UPS town house on March 5 for a fund-raising breakfast. ``We discussed things of interest to their industry. You make small talk, get to know somebody. . . . They made a contribution,'' he said.<P>

   Gillmor, who sits on the House Commerce Committee, received a $4,000 donation. His committee handles many issues vital to UPS, including vehicle and driver safety standards and interstate commerce.<P>

   At about the same time, UPS also remembered Gillmor's wife, Karen, donating $4,000 in February to her re-election campaign for the Ohio state Senate.<P>

   The company also gave to other state legislative candidates in Ohio, but Karen Gillmor stood apart -- her contribution was more than 10 times the average.<P>

   Gillmor denied any connection. ``She does her campaign, I do my campaign. Some of our contributors are the same, most are different. . . . We both have UPS installations in our districts. I've never had the sense that that (spousal relationship) was a factor in anybody's contributions.''<P>

   Another favored guest was Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the Transportation Committee, which has obvious importance to UPS.<P>

   Shuster came to a gathering at the town house Feb. 27, where he and his son Bob, who last month lost his bid for Congress in the Pennsylvania primaries, collected $4,750 apiece.<P>

   Others recently invited by UPS include Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; Rep. Jack Reed, D-R.I.; Sen. John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va.; Rep. Jimmy Hayes, R-La.; Rep. Robert Franks, R-N.J.; Rep. Frank Mascara, D-Pa.; Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.; Rep. Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va., and Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan.
