<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) Relatives of the victims of the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, have begun taking advantage of a change in federal law that allows them to sue Libya for its alleged role in the 1988 terrorist attack that killed 270 people, including 189 Americans.<ep>
   In Washington, lawyers for Victoria Cummock of Coral Gables, whose husband, John, was killed in the attack, filed a class action lawsuit Friday against Libya, the two alleged bombers, Libyan Arab Airlines and the Libyan External Security Organization. Last week, lawyers for relatives of 91 of the bombing's victims filed a civil case in Brooklyn's federal court.<ep>
   The lawsuits were filed after President Clinton signed an anti-terrorism bill with provisions that allow victims of terrorist acts abroad to sue foreign countries in American courts. In the class action suit filed in Washington, Cummock's lawyers are asking for $1 billion in punitive damages for the attack.<ep>
   Previously, the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act doomed such lawsuits. But even with the major change, the victims' relatives face a tough fight. The anti-terrorism bill allows the attorney general to avoid turning over information about the bombing while U.S. authorities are pursuing a criminal case against two Libyan intelligence agents who have been charged in the case but remain in Libya. The Justice Department could argue that airing evidence in the civil cases could jeopardize the criminal case if it ever came to trial.<ep>
   A bomb hidden in a portable radio cassette player packed in a suitcase exploded on Pan Am 103 on Dec. 21, 1988, after it took off from London's Heathrow Airport en route to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.<ep>
   Libya has been under strict economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations for its failure to turn over the two defendants indicted in the bombing. The defendants, Abdel-Basset Ali Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, were charged in the United States and England in November 1991.<ep>
   According to Cummock's lawsuit, Fhimah and Al-Megrahi served in high-ranking positions in the Libyan Arab Airlines that allowed them to learn about security lapses at airports in other countries. At the same time, they served in similarly top positions within the Libyan External Security Organization, the Libyan intelligence service.<ql>
