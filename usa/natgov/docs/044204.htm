   WASHINGTON -- President Clinton on Monday endorsed a bill that would give a $5,000 tax credit to most families adopting a child and punish states that make it difficult for whites to adopt black children.<P>

   Clinton's support, expressed in a letter he sent to House Republicans, makes it likely that the bill -- originally part of the conservative Republican ``Contract With America'' -- will become law.<P>

   The proposed adoption legislation is unlikely to have a large impact on the enormous problem of half a million children waiting in foster care in the United States, child welfare experts say. There are too many children in need and not enough potential parents of either race, they explain.<P>

   Still, many Republicans and moderate Democrats see the legislation as a useful first step.<P>

   ``We haven't deluded ourselves into thinking this is the solution,'' said Patrick Purtill of the National Council for Adoption. ``But we think removing some of the barriers is better than removing none of them.''<P>

   Clinton's decision clearly reflects an election-year strategy of making family issues a central <BR>

theme in his campaign.<P>

   On Saturday, Clinton told states they would lose federal funds if they don't end welfare payments to teenage parents who refuse to stay in school or live with a parent or guardian. House Republicans have long sought such measures as a part of their welfare reform proposals.<BR>
The transracial issue<P>

   Many in Congress have long supported a less-restrictive adoption process, disregarding the cultural concerns raised by the placement of minority children with white parents.<P>

   But some black child welfare administrators have opposed transracial adoption -- the placement of black and other minority children with white families. The National Association of Black Social Workers has condemned the practice as ``racial genocide.''<P>

   In his letter, Clinton called such concerns ``outdated assumptions,'' and said he was ``committed to breaking down barriers and making adoptions easier,'' by providing financial incentives and eliminating racial barriers.<P>

   In the past, some child welfare agencies have opted to keep black children in foster care rather than place them in white homes, arguing that they would be culturally deprived in such settings.<P>

   Nearly half of the 500,000 children in foster care are black and they often languish without families as much as five times longer than white children.<P>

   Sheryl Chatman, executive director of the Baptist Home for Children and Families in Bethesda, Md., said she would have preferred that Clinton endorse legislation that committed more resources to finding minority parents. She and others think the transracial adoption issue is too complex to be solved with a tax credit and a slap on the wrist.<BR>
Problems not documented<P>

   But supporters of the proposed law say research shows that transracially adopted children don't suffer in white homes.<P>

   ``These so-called problems just don't show up in longitudinal research,'' Purtill said. ``They are well-adjusted, have a strong sense of self-esteem, and are excelling in school. They're doing just fine.''<P>

   The legislation, which may be voted on by the House later this week, would provide a $5,000 tax credit for families earning up to $75,000 a year. The credit would be lower for families with incomes between $75,000 and $115,000, and disappear for families earning more than $115,000.<P>

   States that delay the placement of minority children with white families would risk losing federal adoption assistance funds.<P>

   The bill's advocates say that there's no way blacks, who are 12 percent of the country's population, could ever meet the steadily growing need for black adoptive parents.<P>

   Former Ohio senator Howard Metzenbaum, a Democrat, led the crusade to end the practice of ``race matching'' black children with black families with his Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994.<P>

   But when it wrote the rules for states on the new law, Clinton's Department of Health and Human Services allowed cultural issues to be considered as part of the adoption process -- a move that some supporters of the 1994 law said gutted the intent of the measure.
