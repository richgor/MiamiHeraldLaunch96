<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) States would be required to inform the public when a convicted sex offender considered a danger to the public gets out of prison and settles in the neighborhood under a tougher version of ``Megan's Law'' under consideration Tuesday by the House.<ep>
   ``Today we're putting the rights of children above the rights of convicted sex offenders,'' said Rep. Dick Zimmer, R-N.J.<ep>
   The bill is named after 7-year-old Megan Kanka of Hamilton Township, N.J., who was killed two years ago. A convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her (--) unbeknown to the Kankas (--) is accused of the crime.<ep>
   New Jersey then passed a bill called ``Megan's Law,'' and the federal 1994 crime law included similar provisions that allowed states to inform communities when a known sexual offender is released from prison and moving into their area.<ep>
   This bill would require such notification. But it would still let states rate the danger of offenders and determine how much public warning would be appropriate, from telling just local schools and youth groups to ordering door-to-door visits with each neighbor. If states fail to establish a system by September 1997, they would lose some federal anti-crime funds.<ep>
   The Florida Legislature passed a law in 1995 requiring that communities be notified when sex offenders are released. Fourteen other states also require community notification when dangerous child molesters are released, according to Zimmer, the bill's sponsor.<ep>
   The Clinton administration supported the new Megan's Law bill as well as three others considered by the House on Tuesday.<ep>
   By voice vote, the House passed a bill that would close a loophole in the 1994 crime law's interstate stalking provision, making it a crime for anyone to cross state lines to injure or harass another person.<ep>
   The current law applies only to stalking by current or former spouses or intimate partners. In addition to extending the law to nonrelated individuals, this bill would make restraining orders from one state valid in all.<ep>
   Also slated for action were bills that would:<ep>
   (box) Automatically increase the sentences for those convicted of violent crimes against children 14 and under, senior citizens 65 and older and the mentally or physically disabled. Most violent crimes fall under state laws. Supporters said the objective of the law was to prompt states to enact similar legislation.<ep>
   (box) Increase the punishment of those convicted of jury or witness tampering or witness retaliation from the current 10 years to the maximum penalty for the crime being tried in the case, other than the death penalty.<ep>
