   WASHINGTON (--) In the first such move by one of the Big Three networks, CBS said Monday that it would give the presidential candidates free air time this fall on its morning and evening news shows.<ep>
   But the network stopped short of a bipartisan coalition's request that the access be provided during prime-time evening hours. The Fox network offered in February to provide such time, and PBS joined the effort last week. TCI News, a unit of the Denver-based cable giant, also has been giving the candidates free time.<ep>
   ``Our plan is to invite the candidates to appear on CBS News programs to address the issues of greatest concern to the viewers,'' Martin Franks, a CBS senior vice president, said in a letter. ``These concerns will be determined by a CBS News nationwide poll. The candidates would be given substantial time to give their views in a form that allows them to speak directly to the voters.''<ep>
   Franks said in an interview that taped comments by the candidates would be aired on the <m0>CBS Evening News <m0>and CBS <m0>This Morning,<m0> probably daily, for the ``last couple of weeks'' of the campaign. He said the candidates would be asked to submit tapes of up to 1 1/2 minutes on a half-dozen issues identified by the poll.<ep>
   ``We will let them stand without instant analysis or further commentary,'' Franks said. ``It's meant to give them a clean shot at the audience without it being a quiz on how quick they are on their feet.''<ep>
   Paul Taylor, the former Washington Post reporter who heads the Free TV for Straight Talk Coalition, said: ``This is a delicious half a loaf, and CBS is to be congratulated for offering it, but it's only half a loaf.'' He said the air time would be ``all the more worthwhile in prime time, where it would reach more than double the audience, including tens of millions who've stopped watching the news and stopped voting because they've become deeply cynical about public life.''<ep>
   Taylor has been joined by former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite, other journalists and senators of both parties in urging the free time as a way to elevate the campaign discourse. NBC, ABC and CNN have not rushed to embrace the proposal.<ep>
