   WASHINGTON -- A health-reform bill that would help 25 million Americans with medical problems get or keep insurance is being threatened by partisan bickering over a tax break for one million taxpayers.<P>

   Conservative Republicans say there won't be a health-care bill this year unless it includes tax breaks for a controversial kind of insurance called a medical savings account, or MSA. Democrats say MSAs are veto bait for President Clinton.<P>

   With an MSA, patients would pay for routine health costs from a special tax-sheltered savings account. They would also have to carry so-called catastrophic insurance for medical expenses above $1,500.<P>

   Independent experts say MSAs could be a dud with consumers. The reason: They involve more risk than health maintenance organizations or traditional insurance.<P>

   Congress' own experts project that many fewer people would benefit from MSAs than from the noncontroversial provisions of the health-care bill.<P>

   According to congressional tax analysts, a majority of the one million tax filers who would use MSAs would be upper-middle-class and high-income.<P>

<BR>

   It compares with 25 million individuals who would be helped by noncontroversial sections of the bill, according to estimates by Congress' General Accounting Office. Those provisions would limit insurers' ability to deny coverage to people with health problems and make it easier for workers to switch jobs without a break in insurance.<P>

   About 160 million Americans have private insurance coverage, and nearly 40 million are uninsured.<P>

   The intensity of the debate over medical savings accounts puzzles some experts.<P>

   They attribute it to ideology, political competition and the impact of sharp lobbying and campaign contributions to Republicans by insurance companies that sell catastrophic coverage.<P>

   ``It's a combination of free-market Republican sentiments plus heavy contributing,'' said Dave Durenberger, a former GOP senator from Minnesota who has long been involved in health-care issues.<P>

   As to the real-world consequences of MSAs, an independent report by the American Academy of Actuaries concluded they would be ``relatively minor.''<P>

   It said consumers won't flock to MSAs because of uncertainty about risk. Employers, meanwhile, are likely to stick with managed-care plans. MSAs would not help the uninsured.<P>

<BR>

   That undercuts the importance both sides are giving the issue. The Republican promise that MSAs will be a boon, as well as the Democratic warning that they will cripple the insurance system by enticing away the healthy, could be equally exaggerated.<P>

   The House-passed bill includes MSAs. The Senate bill does not, but a majority of Republican senators support them. A conference committee will have to sort out the differences.<P>

   MSAs are legal right now. What the House would do is provide a tax break that makes them more attractive.<P>

   Here's how MSAs would work under the House bill:<P>

   <LI> A person or an employer would buy a lower-cost ``catastrophic'' health insurance policy that starts paying claims only after at least $1,500 of annual expenses for an individual, or $3,000 for a family.<P>

   <LI> Either the worker or employer could deposit up to $2,000 a year for an individual or $4,000 for a family in a medical savings account. The money deposited and any interest would be tax-free. Balances could be carried over from year to year. A penalty would be imposed on withdrawals for anything other than health care.<P>

   Studies have shown that MSAs can be a better deal than traditional insurance for the healthy majority. But if people get seriously ill or injured, they can be caught short.
