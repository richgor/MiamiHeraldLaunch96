   Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, called the court's expedited review ``unnecessary and profoundly unwise.''<ep>
   Consideration of the weighty constitutional questions involved ``should be undertaken with the utmost deliberation, rather than unseemly haste,'' Stevens declared.<ep>
   Sweeping those objections aside, the justices set oral argument for June 3. They are expected to rule before July 4 in the case of Ellis Wayne Felker, who was convicted 13 years ago of the rape and murder of a 19-year-old college student south of Macon, Ga.<ep>
   Felker, 48, was scheduled to be executed Thursday night at a state prison in Jackson, Ga., but the justices granted a delay so they could review his lawyers' constitutional attack on the appeals provisions of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act.<ep>
   The act limits appeals by setting time limits for filings and rulings, curbing repetitive petitions and toughening standards for review.<ep>
   One provision bars a convicted state defendant from beginning a second round of federal appeals without authorization from a three-judge appellate panel. An inmate who is turned down has no appeal, either to a full appeals court or the Supreme Court.<ep>
   The key constitutional issues before the justices are whether the new law unconstitutionally limits the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or suspends the writ of habeas corpus.<ep>
   The writ, a means of bringing prisoners before federal judges to hear complaints of injustice, may be suspended only during rebellions or invasions when ``the public safety may require it,'' the Constitution states.<ep>
   Felker's lawyers, Stephen C. Bayliss and M. Elizabeth Wells of Atlanta, contend that Congress invaded the constitutional territory of the courts and assured inconsistent results by panels throughout the nation. As a result, they said, ``the death penalty will strike like lightning.''<ep>
   Supporters of such limits argue that death penalty appeals procedures amount to a killers' loophole, often enabling convicted murderers to drag out their cases for 10 years or more.<ep>
   To opponents, tightened appeals procedures increase the possibility that innocent people will be put to death. In recent years, federal judges have reversed convictions, sentences or both in nearly 40 percent of all death penalty cases brought before them on habeas corpus writs.<ep>
   Felker's lawyers claim their client is innocent. But this week in Atlanta, a panel of three judges, all appointees of President Bush, rejected Felker's attempt to file a second federal appeal.<ep>
   Felker was convicted of killing Evelyn Joy Ludlum, whose body was found floating in a creek on Dec. 8, 1981.<ep>
