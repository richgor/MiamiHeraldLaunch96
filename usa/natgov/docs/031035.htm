   WASHINGTON -- William Colby, who as director of central intelligence chose to disclose some of the nation's darkest secrets to save the spy service he loved, spent most of his adult life as a cold warrior in his country's clandestine service, ``a soldier-priest,'' as a colleague called him, on a covert crusade.<P>

   He perfected the look of an invisible man: gray suits, graying hair, glasses with translucent frames the color of pale white skin. More than one interlocutor noted that when asked a question he did not care to answer, he would tilt back his head so light reflected off the lenses of his glasses, turning his eyes into blank white disks.<P>

   But as the nation's chief spy, he helped reveal the CIA's hidden history and confessed to its sins. And when the Cold War was over, he proposed beating swords into plowshares, arguing that half of the billions for the Pentagon should be invested in education, economic competitiveness and programs for the poor.<P>

   This transformation began April 27, 1973, 12 days before Colby learned that President Richard Nixon, then deeply enmeshed in the Watergate scandal, was about to nominate him as director of central intelligence.<P>

   Colby's immediate predecessor, James R. Schlesinger, had vowed to tear the agency apart if necessary to ``find out if there were questionable or illegal activities hidden in the secret recesses of our clandestine past that we didn't know about and that might explode at any time under our feet.''<P>

   Colby, the agency's director of covert operations, was left with a task that violated every precept of a secret agency: compiling a list of the deepest secrets.<P>

   The agency's clandestine officers called the list ``the family jewels,'' or ``the skeletons.'' It stayed secret -- for a while.<BR>
Possibly leaked to the press<BR>
<P>

   Colby's confirmation hearings that summer were excruciating, in part because of his past in Vietnam. From 1968 to 1971, under the aegis of the Agency for International Development, Colby had run programs that included Operation Phoenix. Conceived by the White House and supported by the CIA, that program sought to expose Viet Cong agents working in South Vietnam.<P>

   Phoenix killed 20,587 Vietnamese. Colby told Congress in 1971 that these deaths included ``illegal killing.''<P>

   Before the vote to confirm him as the nation's 10th director of central intelligence, Colby decided to share the family jewels with a few select members of Congress.<P>

   The secrets did not keep. In December 1974, The New York Times reported that the agency had spied on Americans, and Colby was a source for the article. The pressure for a full congressional investigation grew irresistible. Colby cooperated, and the skeletons began tumbling out of the closet.<P>

   Senior agency officers called him a traitor. Some hinted that he was a Soviet agent. Those hints grew darker in January 1975, after Colby dismissed James Angleton, for 20 years the agency's chief of counterintelligence. Obsessed with a search for a Soviet spy inside the agency, Angleton had developed ornate theories of Soviet plots to subvert the United States.<P>

   To save the agency, Colby believed, he had to confess to its sins. He felt it crucial to educate Congress, the press and the public about the agency.<BR>

   Even after his dismissal as director of central intelligence in November 1975 by President Gerald Ford, who believed that Colby had been too forthcoming, Colby insisted he had done the right thing by throwing the cloak off the cloak-and-dagger business.<P>

   William Egan Colby was born on Jan. 4, 1920, in St. Paul, Minn. In 1943, while in the Army, he answered a call for officers who could speak fluent French and became a member of the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime American espionage agency.<P>

   In 1944, he parachuted behind German lines to link up with a French resistance group. In 1945, he commanded a squad of saboteurs who blew up German rail lines in the snows of northern Norway. For these missions, he earned the Silver Star and the French Croix de Guerre.<P>

   After the war, he returned to Columbia and received a law degree in 1947. But the law bored him, and he joined the fledgling CIA in 1950.<P>

   Posing as a diplomat, Colby served in Stockholm from 1951 to 1953; in Rome from 1953 to 1958; and, fatefully, as the CIA's station chief in Saigon from 1959 to 1962. He was responsible for all the agency's covert operations in Asia from 1962 to 1967, as the United States went to war in Vietnam.<P>

   Colby left Saigon and returned to Washington in 1971, in part to care for his eldest daughter, Catherine, who was slowly dying of anorexia nervosa. At headquarters, he took on desk jobs that led two years later to the directorship.<P>

   In retirement, Colby lectured, practiced law and worked as a risk consultant to clients that included New York investment banks.<P>

   In recent months, Colby embarked on a quintessential post-Cold War endeavor: marketing a computer CD-ROM game about espionage and counter-terrorism he created with Oleg Kalugin, a former top Soviet intelligence officer.
