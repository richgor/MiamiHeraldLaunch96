   WASHINGTON (--) The Senate on Thursday passed a measure requiring all states to warn communities when convicted sex offenders who might still pose a danger settle in their neighborhoods.<ep>
   Similar legislation, modeled after a two-year-old New Jersey statute known as Megan's Law, was approved by the House on Tuesday to amend the 1994 federal crime act. President Clinton, who strongly supports the legislation, is expected to sign it into law when it reaches his desk in the next few days.<ep>
   ``The administration has a longstanding commitment to insuring the safety of families and protecting them from child molesters and sexually violent offenders,'' the White House said Thursday.<ep>
   The measure, approved by a voice vote in the Senate, would require states to make public ``relevant information'' about child molesters and sexually violent offenders who are released from prison or placed on parole. The information would include the address where the offender is expected to live.<ep>
   The Florida Legislature adopted a similar community-notification law last year.<ep>
   The Senate did not take any action Thursday on three other crime measures that the House approved this week and that the White House also supports.<ep>
   Megan's law is named after Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old girl from Hamilton Township, N.J., who was kidnapped, raped and killed in July 1994. A new neighbor who was a twice-convicted sex offender was subsequently charged.<ep>
