<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) The House on Thursday approved a bill that would overhaul the nation's public-housing programs by giving local authorities more latitude to raise rents, oust troublemakers and attract more working people to serve as role models.<ep>
   The five-year, $65.5 billion bill, which passed 315-107, would substantially reduce the federal government's financing of public housing. By the turn of the century, federal spending for public housing would be about 60 percent less than what it might have been under the law in 1995.<ep>
   In the Florida delegation, 14 of the 15 Republicans voted for the bill, as did Democrat Pete Peterson of Marianna. Seven of the eight Democrats opposed the measure, as did Republican Joe Scarborough of Pensacola.<ep>
   Although the bill incorporates many of the reforms already put in place by the Clinton administration, it also contains several provisions the president opposes. The administration said the president does not support the bill in its current form.<ep>
<m0>Higher income threshold<ql>
<m0>   One of the controversial provisions would raise the income threshold in determining eligibility for space in public housing. The average income now ranges between $6,420 and $6,900. Under the House-passed bill, critics complained, some families earning up to $40,000 theoretically would be eligible.<ep>
   Another controversial provision would eliminate existing rules that set aside up to 85 percent of public-housing units for the poorest tenants, reducing the set-asides to 35 percent.<ep>
   Sponsors said this would draw in more working families that could serve as role models and encourage more diversity in project populations. Critics, including the Clinton administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development, say many near-destitute people could be precluded from decent housing.<ep>
   The Senate earlier passed its version of the bill, which differs in key respects from the House measure and is much closer to what the administration wants.<ep>
<m0>More local flexibility<ql>
<m0>   A major change in the House bill would transform the 3,400 existing public-housing authorities around the nation into new Local Management Housing Authorities with far greater flexibility in managing local public-housing facilities.<ep>
   New 12-member boards, which would have to include at least two recipients of public-housing aid, would set broad policy for each local housing authority and monitor its compliance with the policy. Each authority would have a free hand to set rents for tenants and control the income mix of renters.<ep>
   That provision sparked a raucous debate between Republican sponsors of the bill and opponents, in both parties, over whether some low-income families would be priced out of some rentals and made homeless.<ep>
   Opponents tried and failed to retain an existing provision that restricts housing agencies from charging rents higher than 30 percent of a tenant's monthly income.<ql>
