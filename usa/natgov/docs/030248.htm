NO SIGN OF FOUL PLAY: William Colby.

   ROCK POINT, Md. -- (AP) -- After an eight-day search involving divers, dogs and sonar equipment, the body of former CIA Director William Colby was found face down in a marshy riverbank Monday, near where he disappeared on a canoe outing.<P>

   Authorities said the 76-year-old retired spy master was probably alive when he fell into the water and suffered hypothermia and drowned. There were no marks on the body to indicate foul play, Sheriff Fred Davis said.<P>

   ``There is nothing unusual about this case at all,'' he said.<P>

   Colby, whose family owns a waterfront vacation home in this southern Maryland town, had been missing since April 27, when he told his wife by phone that he was going canoeing. She was out of town at the time.<P>

   His body was found on a secluded spit of beach about a half-mile from his home, 100 yards downstream of where his swamped canoe was discovered a day after he disappeared. No life jacket was found with the body.<P>

   Colby's wife, Sally Shelton-Colby, identified the body, clad in khaki pants, a red windbreaker, a blue and white shirt and no shoes. She said her husband customarily kept the life jacket in the canoe but didn't wear it.<P>

   Experts had said that the buildup of decomposition gases in a body after death often brings a drowning victim's body to the surface after a few days. The colder the water, the longer the process takes.<P>

   Colby's body was believed to be in water seven to 13 feet deep and at temperatures less than 60 degrees, so it was not considered unusual that it took nine days to surface.<P>

   ``What happened today is, nature took its course,'' said Lt. Mark Sanders, an officer with the state Department of Natural Resources.<P>

   The search, which at one time included dogs, divers, sonar equipment and drag lines, had been scaled back in recent days.<P>

   ``Judging by what we've seen, he was alive when he went over and there was nothing like a heart attack,'' Sanders said.
