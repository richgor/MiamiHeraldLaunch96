<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) President Clinton said Wednesday he would accept a temporary cut in the gasoline tax as Republicans have proposed, but some economists questioned how much of the reduction ever will get to consumers.<ep>
   Clinton said he would sign the gas tax repeal only in tandem with a separate bill raising the minimum wage. The two issues have stalled the Senate all week.<ep>
   Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., had offered to push both a tax reduction and a minimum wage increase in a single bill, but also attached a controversial change in labor law that is strongly opposed by unions.<ep>
   The dispute brought the Senate to a halt Wednesday, blocking consideration of other legislation, including health care and welfare reform.<ep>
   ``I am offering a way to break the logjam,'' Clinton told a White House news conference. Dole later suggested he might agree to three separate bills, but details were not clear.<ep>
   Clinton emphasized he would sign the gas tax and minimum wage bills only if they were free of ``poison pills'' (--) such as Dole's proposed labor law change.<ep>
   Clinton's pronouncement was the first clear indication that he would accept a gasoline tax cut, albeit with some conditions.<ep>
   It came as Republican and Democratic lawmakers sparred both on the Senate floor and in two House committees over whether the gas tax cut (--) as well as a decision by Clinton to draw on emergency oil stocks (--) actually will drive down gasoline prices.<ep>
   Dole told reporters he is convinced that the lower taxes will mean lower prices. ``Whatever the price ends up being, it will be 4.3 cents lower,'' insisted Dole.<ep>
   But some economists questioned whether the gas tax reduction would force down gasoline prices, which have jumped 20 cents or more a gallon since February.<ep>
   ``I don't think you'll see it,'' said Philip Verleger, an oil industry analyst for Charles River Associates. ``It's not going to get reflected in the retail price, certainly not until after Labor Day.''<ep>
   Verleger told a House subcommittee that tight gasoline supplies and summer driving demand would ease pressure on refiners and gasoline station operators to pass the tax cut on to motorists.<ep>
   ``The refiners are going to have a strong incentive to put it in their pocket and rejoice,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.<ep>
   Oil industry representatives disagreed.<ep>
   ``I'm convinced almost all of [the tax cut] is going to come back to the consumer sooner rather than later,'' said Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the trade group representing large oil companies.<ep>
   The 4.3-cent-per-gallon surcharge was enacted in 1993 without a single GOP vote as part of a broader deficit reduction package championed by Clinton and congressional Democrats. Two weeks ago, Dole began pushing for a repeal of the surcharge, seizing on motorists' discontent over gasoline prices.<ep>
   Democrats accused Dole of using the issue for political gain. Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., on Wednesday called Dole's proposal ``the worst pandering I've seen in my 76 years.''<ep>
   But Republicans were just as critical of Clinton's decision to draw down the national emergency stockpile of petroleum in an attempt to ease gasoline prices, calling it ``political grandstanding'' that will have little actual affect on prices.<ep>
   Energy Department officials, however, defended the move and said the first oil from the emergency reserve would be put on the market next week.<ep>
