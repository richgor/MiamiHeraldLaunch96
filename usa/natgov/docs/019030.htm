   WASHINGTON -- (AP) -- The House voted overwhelmingly Friday to encourage more adoptions, promising parents tax incentives and banning racial hurdles. Supporters said the measure would decrease the number of youngsters -- particularly black children -- languishing in foster care.<P>

   The bill would offer families a $5,000 tax credit to adopt children and would ban ``race matching,'' a policy that allows social workers to reject or put potential interracial adoptions on hold until adoptive parents can be found matching a child's race.<P>

   There is controversy in the field on that issue. For example, the National Association of Black Social Workers has said interracial adoptions should be approved only after exhaustive attempts to find a relative or black adoptive parents have failed.<P>

   The House voted 393-15 to approve the plan, which would provide the tax credit to families earning up to $75,000 a year to help pay for adoption expenses. Smaller credits would be given to families earning up to $115,000, with no credits above that level.<P>

   A similar bill is making its way through the Senate.<P>

   Florida's House delegation supported the bill 22-1. Miami Democrat Carrie Meek voted against it.<P>

   Complicated adoptions, particularly those involving foreign children, can cost $15,000 or more.<P>

   After the vote, House Republicans involved in bringing the bill to a vote celebrated with three families that have adopted children.<P>

   ``Thank you for passing this bill so more kids like me can be adopted,'' said Reid McKenney, 9, the Korea-born adopted son of William McKenney of Arlington, Va. Reid spoke before television news cameras while standing on a chair.<P>

   ``We're happy that we were able to get this done, and we're happy to get it done by Mother's Day,'' Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., said.<P>

   About 450,000 American children live in foster care at any given moment, according to the bill, and as many as 600,000 live in foster care during a year. About half are minorities, and 41 percent of black children in foster care wait more than four years to be adopted.<P>

   President Clinton endorsed both the tax credit and the elimination of race matching, but opposed another provision that would make it easier for anyone to adopt American Indian children.<P>

   Some white parents have complained that the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act has kept them from adopting children with as little as 1/64th Indian ancestry.<P>

   Some Indians have denounced the bill's provision, saying it would weaken a law enacted to preserve their cultures by placing Indian children in Indian homes. The new measure also would allow courts to decide who is Indian and who is not, they said.<P>

   The tax credit was part of the GOP's Contract With America.<P>

   To offset a $1.7 billion loss in tax revenue, the bill would change tax rules for foreign trusts with U.S. beneficiaries and eliminate an income exclusion for energy conservation items that businesses buy and use.
