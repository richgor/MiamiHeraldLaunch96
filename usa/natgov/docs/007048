<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) Senate Democrats blocked a vote Tuesday on cutting the gasoline tax after Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., balked at increasing the minimum wage without tying it to legislation strongly opposed by organized labor.<ql>

<m0>   In a half-<m4>Dole<m2><ql>
<m0>hour of intense maneuvering, the two parties fought each other to a standoff over the two high-stakes campaign issues that have swept virtually everything else to the sidelines on Capitol Hill.<ep>
   Dole, who is championing the gasoline tax cut as a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, suggested talks between key party leaders to end the impasse. Democrats warned it would have to be resolved before any more legislation moves through the Senate, although they say they will not attempt to thwart passage of the gasoline tax rollback once agreement is reached on the minimum wage.<ep>
   ``We're obviously in a situation where we aren't going to get anything done . . . until we resolve this impasse,'' said Minority Leader Thomas Daschle, D-S.D.<ep>
   The minimum wage increase (--) from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour over two years (--) is causing problems for Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., because it commands enough votes to pass in both houses but evokes intense opposition from conservatives within each Republican caucus. The leaders are trying to sweeten the pill for unhappy Republicans by tying it to some of their favored causes. <ep>
   By the end of Tuesday's maneuvering, Dole offered Democrats a vote on the minimum wage but only as part of a bill that would include both the gasoline tax cut and a proposal to permit employers to deal with workers on work-related issues outside of the normal collective bargaining process.<ep>
   The AFL-CIO vehemently opposes the proposal as anti-union. It has strong business backing.<ep>
