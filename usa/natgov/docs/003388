   WASHINGTON (--) The Joint Chiefs of Staff have watered down a proposed U.S. moratorium on land mines, recommending a broad exception that could allow the use of mines anywhere the United States and its allies need protection from an enemy across a demilitarized zone, Clinton administration officials said Friday.<ep>
   The proposal, which was presented to President Clinton in a White House meeting Friday, would allow the use of mines indefinitely in Korea and other potential war zones where the United States and its allies patrol a demilitarized area recognized by the United Nations.<ep>
   The wording of a statement by the Joint Chiefs suggests that the United States could use mines in the Persian Gulf, including the buffer zone between Kuwait and Iraq established after the 1991 war, and in other regions where war is a threat.<ep>
   Legislators and organizations seeking a complete ban on land mines said they were outraged by the recommendations, which came after a two-year Pentagon study of whether land mines were still needed in the U.S. military arsenal.<ep>
   More than 20,000 people, mostly civilians, are killed or maimed by mines each year, and several international organizations have joined in a campaign for a worldwide ban on their use.<ep>
   ``The Pentagon's recommendation would be a tragic failure of American leadership,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who has led congressional efforts to totally ban the use of land mines. ``Instead of encouraging other countries to stop using these weapons, it would give a green light to their continued use for years to come.''<ep>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, defended the recommendations, which he described as subject to change.<ep>
   ``We're looking for a formula that will meet the president's promise of eliminating the use of anti-personnel land mines,'' Bacon said. ``There's a humanitarian imperative to do this, but we have to balance the humanitarian imperative with the need to protect our forces.''<ep>
   Under the Joint Chiefs' proposal, the United States would ban the use of devices known as dumb land mines, which remain active indefinitely, by the end of 1999 except ``to defend the U.S. and its allies from armed aggression that crosses a demilitarized zone recognized by the United Nations and incorporated in an armistice agreement.''<ep>
   The United States could also continue to use devices known as smart mines, which self-destruct or deactivate over time, until there is an international agreement banning their use.<ep>
