<m0>   RALEIGH, N.C. (--) (AP) (--) Former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt swept aside political newcomer Charlie Sanders in Tuesday's racially charged Democratic primary, setting up a rematch with Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.<ep>
   With 49 percent of precincts reporting, Gantt had 143,049 votes, or 53 percent; Sanders had 111,168 votes, or 41 percent; and Ralph McKinney of Durham had 13,888 votes or 5 percent.<ep>
   The Democratic Senate race pitted Sanders, the former chief executive of pharmaceutical giant Glaxo, against the first black mayor of Charlotte in an often bitter campaign.<ep>
   Sanders campaigned as the only Democrat who could beat Helms in November. Gantt lost to Helms 52 percent to 48 percent in the 1990 general election.<ep>
   Gantt accused Sanders of playing the race card by implying that he has an edge against Helms because he is white in a state where blacks make up just 20 percent of registered voters.<ep>
   Helms, who is seeking a fifth term, faced no primary opposition but has already run attack ads accusing both Democrats of being liberals who support racial preferences in hiring and health benefits for gay partners.<ep>
