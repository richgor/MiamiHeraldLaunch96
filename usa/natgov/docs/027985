<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) A House committee voted Thursday to seek a criminal contempt charge against three presidential aides after President Clinton invoked executive privilege and refused to turn over documents involving the White House travel office firings.<ep>
   ``The president has directed me to inform you that he invokes executive privilege, as a protective matter,'' White House counsel Jack Quinn wrote the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee.<ep>
   The Republican-led committee voted 27-19, along party lines, to approve the contempt resolution.<ep>
   The vote followed several hours of rancorous partisan debate, in which Republicans insisted that the White House was stonewalling their investigation by withholding the documents, and Democrats accused Republicans of using McCarthy-era tactics.<ep>
   Quinn's letter left open the possibility that, after further review, some documents the White House is withholding may be released.<ep>
   Nevertheless, his letter drew an immediate, sharp response from the committee's chairman.<ep>
   ``Unfortunately, the White House, in keeping with their culture of secrecy, has decided to withhold from this investigation a vaguely defined body of documents,'' Rep. William Clinger, R-Pa., said.<ep>
   The contempt resolution will have to be voted on by the full House.<ep>
   Named in the document subpoenas and the contempt resolution were Quinn and former White House aides David Watkins and Matthew Moore. <ep>
   Contempt of Congress carries a $1,000 fine and up to a year in prison.<ep>
   The White House said the move was protective, since Congress had given Clinton until Wednesday to turn over the documents or face a contempt vote, and that a final decision on which documents ultimately will be covered by the privilege will be made later.<ep>
   Clinger accused the White House of failing to properly detail any claim of executive privilege it might use to justify withholding the documents.<ep>
   ``It is troubling . . . that the president continues to attempt to contain a scandal that has no connection with national security or any vital domestic policy, but at the bottom is a scandal about the character of this presidency,'' he said.<ep>
   At issue are documents related to the White House's firing in May 1993 of the seven longtime employees at the travel office, which arranges charters for reporters traveling with the president. Critics accused the White House of fabricating charges of incompetence against the employees so they could be replaced by Clinton allies.<ep>
