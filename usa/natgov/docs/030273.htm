   WASHINGTON -- (AP) -- States would have to inform the public when dangerous sex offenders are released from prison and move to their neighborhoods under a bill passed Tuesday night by the House.<P>

   The legislation, a federal version of New Jersey's ``Megan's Law,'' was one of four separate anti-crime bills considered Tuesday by the House.<P>

   Lawmakers voted 414-4 for a two-strikes-and-your-out measure that would enable federal prosecutors to seek life sentences without parole for repeat offenders convicted of rape or serious sexual assault.<P>

   ``It's time we got tougher on the most violent, repeat sexual offenders,'' said Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. That bill also toughens sentences for crimes against children, the elderly and the disabled.<P>

   A third bill, passed by voice vote, would expand the reach of federal anti-stalking provisions to include strangers who cross state lines to injure or harass another person.<P>

   There is strong support in the Senate for the legislation, and President Clinton, too, is in favor of the bill.<P>

   Awaiting a final House vote was a bill that would increase the punishment of those convicted of jury or witness tampering or retaliating against a witness from the current 10 years. The new maximum sentence could be the same as that for whatever crime was being tried in the case.<P>

   ``Today we're putting the rights of children above the rights of convicted sex offenders,'' said Rep. Dick Zimmer, R-N.J., the bill's author.<P>

   The bill is named after 7-year-old Megan Kanka of Hamilton Township, N.J., who was killed two years ago. A convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her home -- unbeknownst to the Kankas -- is accused of the crime.<P>

   New Jersey passed a law mandating various levels of notification depending on an offender's record. A Florida law passed in 1985 did the same.<P>

   A 1994 federal law included provisions allowing such notifications when a know sex offender is released from prison but not mandating.<P>

   The House bill would require such notification. However, it would still let states rate the danger offenders pose and determine how much public warning would be appropriate, from telling only local schools and youth groups to ordering door-to-door visits with all neighbors. If states failed to establish a system by September 1997, they would lose some federal anti-crime funds.<P>

   ``Sexual offenders are different,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``No matter what we do, the minute they get back on the street, many of them resume their hunt for victims, beginning a restless and unrelenting prowl for children, innocent children, to molest, abuse, and in the worst cases, to kill.''
