<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) Settling an election-year battle between trial lawyers and business, the House of Representatives has sustained President Clinton's veto of a bill limiting damage awards in lawsuits over faulty products.<ep>
   The vote was 258-163 in favor of overriding Clinton's objections (--) 23 votes shy of the two-thirds majority needed to enact a law over the president's veto.<ep>
   In the Florida delegation, 14 of the 15 Republicans voted to override the veto, and all eight Democrats voted to sustain it, as did Republican Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Miami.<ep>
   In rejecting the bill last week, Clinton said it would do little to improve the legal system but ``would mean more unsafe products in our homes. It would let wrongdoers off the hook.''<ep>
   Limiting monetary awards for damages has been a major goal of manufacturers and businesses for 13 years. Consumer groups and lawyers representing people who claim to have been harmed by faulty products have just as adamantly opposed any such limitations.<ep>
   In debate before Thursday's vote, Democratic lawmakers supporting the veto argued that corporations spent lavishly on Republicans to get the bill passed. Republicans demanding an override countered that trial lawyers' financial support of Clinton influenced the president.<ep>
   The legislation would have capped the punitive damages a jury could award in cases involving faulty products. Punitive damages could not have exceeded the larger of $250,000 or twice the claimant's compensatory damages. <ep>
