<m0>   WASHINGTON (--) (AP) (--) A proposed rollback of gasoline taxes to help motorists cope with soaring prices cleared a key House committee Thursday, and Republican leaders said they expect final action before Memorial Day.<ep>
   The House Ways and Means Committee advanced legislation that would suspend the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax for seven months, despite warnings by Democratic lawmakers that oil companies, not consumers, are most likely to benefit.<ep>
   Nevertheless, some tax relief for motorists has been gaining bipartisan support in this election year. The rollback, first proposed two weeks ago by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the prospective GOP presidential nominee, was also embraced Wednesday by President Clinton.<ep>
   But Clinton said he would sign the measure only in tandem with legislation that would raise the $4.25 minimum wage. The minimum wage issue has stalled a vote on gas-tax relief in the Senate most of this week.<ep>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told reporters he expects the full House to vote on the tax measure within two weeks and that it has wide support.<ep>
   But the proposal is not without controversy.<ep>
   ``This is political pandering. <m1> <m0>. . . [It's] nothing but one, or perhaps two, politicians running for national political office,'' said Rep. Sam Gibbons of Tampa, the ranking Democrat on the panel, in a clear reference to Dole and Clinton.<ep>
   He suggested there was no need to cut the gasoline tax to deal with what most economists believe is a temporary price spike.<ep>
   ``We need to roll back this tax,'' countered Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the panel's chairman, who questioned whether it should have been imposed in the first place three years ago.<ep>
   The 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax was approved in 1993 on top of an existing 14-cent-a-gallon levy as part of a broader deficit reduction effort championed by Clinton and Democrats who were then the majority in Congress. Not a single Republican lawmaker voted for it.<ep>
   The House bill would repeal the tax six days after the bill becomes law. The levy would be reinstated on Jan. 1, 1997. If passed on to motorists, the tax cut would save them about $15 individually over the seven months, assuming average travel of 15,000 miles a year in a vehicle that gets 25 miles per gallon.<ep>
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., suggested it might be just as good to give every motorist a $15 check and retain the tax. ``There's no assurance consumers will ever see this,'' he said. ``Prices are likely to go up.''<ep>
