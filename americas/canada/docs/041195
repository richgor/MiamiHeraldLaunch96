<m0>   MONTREAL (--) Organized criminals have been roaming the Montreal Casino in search of high-rollers on winning streaks.<ep>
   They choose their targets, follow them from the casino and then rob them of thousands of dollars, police say.<ep>
   A Toronto businessman was robbed at gunpoint, a U.S. tourist was run off the highway and several local residents have been held up at their homes or in their cars.<ep>
   So far, police have arrested two men in their 20s and a 16-year-old girl in connection with one robbery and another failed holdup.<ep>
   The Toronto man was held up by two masked men April 22 when he stopped his car at an intersection on the outskirts of Montreal, said Detective Lt. Mario Gisondi.<ep>
   The man, who didn't want his name made public, said a gun was pointed at his head. He said he tried bluffing by showing them an empty wallet.<ep>
   ``The guy holding the gun said, `You cashed over $3,000 [in chips] at the casino.' Then I knew there was no sense denying it or they would kill me or something.''<ep>
   The man said he handed over about $3,800 hidden on his body and the robbers locked him in trunk of the car.<ep>
   Gisondi said the groundwork for the arrests was helped by casino security personnel who reviewed surveillance videotapes and located victims of recent robberies as they played slot machines or gaming tables.<ep>
   By examining those tapes, police and security officials were able to identify suspected ``spotters'' (--) such as the arrested teenage girl (--) who look for players with lots of cash and follow them to the parking lots.<ep>
   Using cellular telephones, the ``spotters'' would tell their cohorts where the victim's car is heading.<ep>
   In Windsor, Ontario, the provincially owned casino has had some robberies but hasn't experienced teams of criminals staking out high-rollers on winning streaks.<ql>
