<!-- end headlines -->
 OTTAWA -- The House of Commons voted Thursday to add ``sexual orientation'' to the Canadian Human Rights Act, two words that have resulted in acrimonious debate and division within the parties.<P>

   MPs voted 153-76 in favor of Bill C-33 during a free vote. The bill fulfills a decade-old promise by successive governments to outlaw discrimination against homosexuals.

 CALGARY -- Dorothy Joudrie, whose high-society marriage mixed wealth and privilege with abuse and alcoholism, was found not guilty Thursday by reason of mental illness of trying to kill her husband rather than face a divorce.<P>

   Joudrie, 61, shot her estranged husband, oil executive Earl Joudrie, 62, six times in January 1995 at her Calgary home.<P>

   But her lawyer argued she was in a robot-like state, unaware of what she was doing.

 QUEBEC -- Finance Minister Bernard Landry looked ahead to sovereignty Thursday, tabling a budget he says will prepare Quebec's finances for independence but also signaling that he's serious about deficit reduction.<P>

   Landry spared Quebecers income tax increases but targeted big business as he announced the province's deficit would be chopped to $3.3 billion this year from $4 billion.<P>

   The province has come under strong pressure from bond-rating agencies to clean up its finances.

<H2>Ottawa may join sovereignty case today</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 QUEBEC -- Ottawa will likely announce today whether it will join a court case that challenges Quebec's right to unilaterally declare its sovereignty.<P>

   ``It should be [Friday] because it's the deadline,'' said Stephane Dion, federal intergovernmental affairs minister.<P>

   The court case, initiated by Quebec City lawyer Guy Bertrand, was a major topic of discussion between Dion and his provincial counterpart Jacques Brassard on Thursday.<P>

   The Parti Quebecois government wants the case, which begins Monday in Quebec Superior Court, thrown out. It has warned that Ottawa's involvement would be considered a challenge to Quebec's right to decide its own political future.<BR>
IN BUSINESS

 TORONTO -- Canadian stocks closed little changed as investors waited for more signs of whether economic growth will drive up interest rates, analysts said.<P>

   Seagram Co. and BCE Inc. helped lift the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index, while Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan and Alcan Aluminium offset the gains.<P>

   The TSE closed up 0.39 points to 5161.20.<P>

 The U.S. dollar closed Thursday at C$1.3673. The Canadian dollar closed Thursday at U.S. 73.14 cents.<BR>

  During May-September, The Herald publishes Canadian news every Thursday and Sunday, and on other days as space allows. A daily Canadian report will resume in October.
