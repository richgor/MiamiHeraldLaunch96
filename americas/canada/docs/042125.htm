<H2>Chretien won't face assault charges</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 HULL, Que. -- Quebec Justice Minister Paul Begin says his department will not allow charges of common assault to proceed against Prime Minister Jean Chretien.<P>

   ``I have asked for the termination of the procedures [against Chretien],'' Begin told a news conference in Quebec City shortly after a Quebec Court judge said they could go ahead.<P>

   Kenneth Russell, an unemployed man from Moncton, brought the charges against Chretien, which received the go-ahead after a closed-door session before Quebec Court Judge Pierre Chevalier on Monday.<P>

   But Begin said he was maintaining a decision his department had already made not to proceed with charges against Chretien arising from the incident last Feb. 15 when he grabbed demonstrator Bill Clennett by the neck.<P>

   Russell brought no new elements to light in a hearing on his application for charges before the judge, Begin said.

<H2>Quebec leaders worry riot may hurt tourism</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 QUEBEC -- Some Quebec City officials wondered Monday whether the city's tourism industry is about to take a hit after a weekend riot.<P>

   ``It's true that it gives us a bad image,'' Acting Mayor Claude Cantin said. ``But I hope we can remake our image in tourists' eyes.''<P>

   Cantin was particularly worried that pictures of youths hurling bottles and rocks were broadcast over the weekend on CNN, the U.S. cable news network.<P>

   Between 1,000 and 1,500 people clashed with police on the edge of the city's historic old quarter late Saturday night. It took police using tear gas and pepper spray about three hours to disperse the crowd.<P>

   Sixteen arrests were made and eight police officers were injured by flying debris. Windows in about 15 stores and restaurants were smashed and several cars were also damaged.

<H2>Judge: Olympians can don designer duds</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 TORONTO -- Canada's Olympic athletes will have designer clothes on their backs after all at this summer's games in Atlanta.<P>

   A Federal Court judge refused Monday to grant an injunction preventing the athletes from wearing outfits for the Olympics' opening and closing ceremonies that have been credited to designer James Yunker of Toronto.<P>

   Another Toronto designer, Hasmig Possian, had sought the injunction, saying the designs resemble sketches she had submitted well before Yunker's drawings were selected in June 1995.

<H2>200 mourn cabby who died in police custody</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 MONTREAL -- Mourners of a cabbie who died 29 months after he was beaten into a coma in police custody were told Monday to forgive the officers because that's what Richard Barnabe would have wanted.<P>

   But the Rev. Andre Gazaille told the 200 people at Barnabe's funeral that violence should not be tolerated.<P>

   Barnabe, 41, died of internal bleeding last Thursday night. He was arrested in December 1993 after leading police on a wild car chase when they responded to a broken church window in nearby Laval.<P>

   He collapsed in police cells and suffered extensive brain damage. He was in a vegetative state when he was admitted to the hospital and never regained consciousness.<P>

   Four Montreal police officers are appealing their conviction on charges of assault causing bodily harm. A fifth officer was acquitted.

<H2>Pincher caught in immigration pinch</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 MONTREAL -- A Canadian convicted of pinching a woman's behind says the U.S. government is unfairly squeezing him out of this country.<P>

   Paul Toutounjian, 33, of Montreal, is suing the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which denied him entry into the United States. He claims U.S. officials are making too much of the 1986 pinching.<P>

   ``He was inebriated, he was on a Montreal street, and a nice-looking young woman walked by. He put his hand on her posterior,'' his lawyer, Robert Kolken, said Monday. ``Although we don't condone his actions, a simple pinch on the fanny does not render him inherently depraved.''<P>

   Toutounjian pleaded guilty to sexual assault and commission of an indecent act and received two years' probation.<P>

   In 1992, Toutounjian was heading to an Armenian music festival in Boston when American immigration officials barred him from getting on an international flight.<P>

   An immigration judge and an appeals board later upheld the ban.<BR>

<H2>Couple arrested after children beg for money</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 MONTREAL -- Police arrested a French couple over the weekend and placed their three children in protective custody after the man and woman allegedly made the kids beg for money in historic Old Montreal.<P>

   The parents were later released because begging for money isn't a crime in Montreal, police said.<P>

   The parents, who weren't named to protect the children, ages 6, 8 and 9, claim they've done nothing wrong.<P>

   The family is from Nancy, in eastern France, and arrived in Canada with their two daughters and son March 21. They told the newspaper they'd like to move to the French islands of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, near Newfoundland.<P>

   Police arrested the man Saturday in Old Montreal with two of his children. The mother was arrested later with the third child in a small hotel.

<H2>Stocks rise amid demand for gold bullion</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 TORONTO -- Canadian stocks rose for a second session as concern that demand for gold bullion will outstrip supply lifted shares of producing companies, analysts said.<P>

   Barrick Gold, Placer Dome and Alcan Aluminum led the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index up 15.58 points to 5140.10.<P>

   New York-based investment bank Morgan Stanley & Co. Monday raised its recommendation of the percentage of gold shares that investors should hold in their portfolios to 3 percent from 0, citing tight supply and ``inflation fears,'' said Robert van Doorn, Morgan Stanley gold analyst.<P>

   ``This is quite bullish for the sector, in that it says that people will really start believing that gold [bullion] will have a major run,'' van Doorn said.<P>

     The U.S. dollar closed Monday at C$1.3650. The Canadian dollar closed Monday at U.S. 73.26 cents.
