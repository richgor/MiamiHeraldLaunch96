<ue5><m0>Diverse group meets<ql>
on Quebec strategy<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>OTTAWA <m0>(--) Six months after sovereigntists nearly won a referendum in Quebec, old war horses charged out of the past and into the breach Saturday with ideas for keeping the country together.<ep>
   About 100 prominent Canadians (--) among them former Prime Minister Joe Clark, former Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed and onetime Quebec Liberal leader Claude Ryan (--) met in Ottawa to formulate a plan for keeping Quebec in Canada.<ep>
   Many of the recommendations echo ideas from the Clark and Ryan eras, while others mirror the Chretien government's February throne speech.<ep>
   What may be new is that consenus was reached among a fairly disparate group of Canadians that included business leaders, academics and former leaders.<ep>
   Conference 2000, sponsored by the Business Council on National Issues, will deliver its report to the prime minister and each of the premiers. Changes the group says are needed in the next six months include freer trade among the provinces and a federal withdrawal from labor market adjustment and training.<ql>

<ue5><m0>Designers fight<ql>
over Olympic garb<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>TORONTO <m0>(--) Two Toronto clothing designers are locked in a legal struggle over what Canada's athletes will wear at the Summer Games in Atlanta.<ep>
   The dispute threatens to keep the specially designed opening-ceremony outfits on the rack when the games open July 19.<ep>
   For his creations to mark the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympics, designer James Yunker was inspired by the turn of the century: antique-white blazers and slacks for the men, and antique-red vests and long dresses for the women.<ep>
   But another Toronto designer, Hasmig Possian, says Yunker copied her work and is seeking a court injunction, Yunker's lawyer says.<ep>
   Possian's bid for an injunction goes before a Federal Court judge today in Toronto. If she's successful, it's unlikely the Olympic association could commission replacement outfits in time for the opening.<ql>

<ue5><m0>Study: Bad air<ql>
killing Canadians<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>OTTAWA <m0>(--) Bad air is killing Canadians, a new Health Canada study says.<ep>
   The study of Toronto-area hospital records found that when the air is polluted, an extra two to three people a day die from heart and respiratory diseases. Most are 65 or older.<ep>
   That's an increase of 2 to 4 percent for these diseases, the department says.<ep>
   The study area covered metropolitan Toronto, home to about 2.5 million people, over a 20-year period ending in 1990.<ep>
   A Health Canada investigator says Montreal, though it has a slightly different mix of pollutants, has a similar overall air quality to Toronto and may show similar extra deaths. Ottawa, with cleaner air, probably does not.<ql>

<ue5><m0>Specialty channels<ql>
seek spot on dial<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>  <m0>OTTAWA <m0>(--) Rug rats and retirees, sports fans and sci-fi buffs are among TV viewers who could have more channels to surf a year from now.<ep>
   The federal broadcast regulator begins hearing a new round of specialty channel applications today, with 40 applicants lined up for precious space in the TV lineup.<ep>
   The offerings include all-day headline news channels, comedy, kids' shows, sports, history, seniors' programs, outdoor life, ethnic and other programs.<ep>
   It's anyone's guess how many will be licensed by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission. After the last round of applications in 1994, eight channels were awarded, including two French.<ep>
   Licenses will probably be granted next fall, with winners starting up in 1997.<ql>

<ue5><m0>People afraid despite<ql>
alleged killer's arrest<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>ABBOTSFORD, B.C. <m0>(--) After seven months of fear and frustration as police hunted for the jeering killer of 16-year-old Tanya Smith, nervous doubts still trouble residents of this city, who never dreamed such terrifying events could happen in their midst.<ep>
   Terry Driver, the man arrested and charged in the case on Friday, is slated for a brief court appearance today.<ep>
   Yet huge questions and incongruities remain. No one in this city of 105,000, known for its placid farmland and active church groups, seems ready to let their guard down.<ep>
   Driver, a 31-year-old print shop worker, was charged Friday with first-degree murder in Smith's death, and attempted murder in the beating of her friend Misty Cockerill, 16. Cockerill remains in hiding despite the arrest.<ql>

<ue5><m0>Appeal filed to stop<ql>
girl's deportation<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>TORONTO <m0>(--) An appeal has been filed in Federal Court to stop the deportation of a 3-year-old Somali girl whose refugee claim was rejected.<ep>
   An Immigration and Refugee Board ruled last week that Iftin, whose last name can't be revealed because she is a claimant, is not a refugee and should be removed from Canada.<ep>
   ``This is inhumane,'' said her lawyer, Geraldine Sadoway. ``In war, it's the little kids who are the most endangered.''<ep>
   Sadoway said the child was sent here with an adult by her parents in May 1994. Her parents and five siblings live in a refugee camp in Kenya.<ep>
   ``She was young and sick and they didn't think she would survive,'' Sadoway said.<ep>
   But the board threw out the little girl's refugee claim because her father is a citizen of Ethiopia who moved to Somalia but never obtained citizenship there.<ql>

<ue5><m0>Students to attend<ql>
gay and lesbian prom<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>TORONTO <m0>(--) Homosexual high school students will have their own party next month, Toronto's first gay and lesbian prom.<ep>
   Toronto school trustee John Campey said the June 14 prom is sponsored by the public school board's Triangle program but is open to any gay and lesbian student in Toronto.<ep>
   They're hoping about 150 students and adults will attend, he said.<ep>
   Triangle is a transitional program that opened its doors last fall for gay and lesbian high school students.<ql>

<ue5><m0>Convicted killer<ql>
gets birthday visit<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>TORONTO <m0>(--) The mother and sister of convicted killer Karla Homolka visited her in prison Saturday to mark her 26th birthday, says the woman's father.<ep>
   But Karel Homolka told The Toronto Sun there was no party for Karla, who is serving 12 years in prison after pleading guilty in July 1993 to manslaughter in the deaths of teenagers Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy.<ep>
   She also admitted she and ex-husband Paul Bernardo drugged and sexually assaulted her 15-year-old sister Tammy, who later died, apparently after choking on her own vomit.<ep>
   He said his wife, Dorothy, and daughter Lori arrived at the prison for women in Kingston, Ont., Thursday to spend a few days with Karla in a ``little house'' on prison grounds.<ep>
   He said his daughter would probably get ``a birthday card, that's about it . . . the gift is we go there every five weeks.''<ql>
