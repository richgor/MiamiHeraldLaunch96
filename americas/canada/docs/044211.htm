   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Fishing boats crowd the harbor. On the dock, workers hose down the pier, washing away the pungent odor of fish. But they cannot expunge the smell of fear and anger.<P>

   ``I think I will be ruined,'' says Vicko Mise, Croatian-born skipper of the commercial salmon boat Rose-Lind. ``My whole life I fish . . . now I think I lose everything, end up broke, on welfare . . . and all because of the government.''<P>

   Confronted with the imminent collapse of some wild Pacific-salmon stocks, Canada has launched a plan to reduce by half the British Columbia fleet -- in part, by paying fishermen to voluntarily surrender their licenses. If the plan succeeds, 2,200 boats will be permanently beached and thousands of seasonal jobs lost.<P>

   And, desperate to avoid an environmental disaster, officials are also considering a ban on commercial salmon fishing in Canada's western waters. The United States imposed a similar ban in 1993 on Washington state, Oregon and California.<P>

   For many fishermen, the extreme measures mean an end to a generations-old tradition of work on the sea. But without aggressive action now, officials on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border say, independent fishermen will vanish along with wild salmon.<P>

   Fishermen of both nations are struggling more than ever, caught between boom and bust. A worldwide glut of salmon -- mostly Norwegian and Chilean pen-reared fish -- has driven down prices. Simultaneously, efforts to protect dwindling populations of wild Northwest salmon -- and the genetic diversity they represent -- have meant increased regulation and drastically shortened fishing seasons.<P>

   In British Columbia, the commercial salmon fishery employs about 10,000 people and has an estimated worth of $450 million. But Canadian officials say revenues could fall by as much as 40 percent as a result of record low returns to the Fraser and other rivers.<P>

   Poor ocean conditions, overfishing -- and in the United States, habitat loss -- have contributed to the unprecedented decline of many West Coast salmon populations.<P>

   Because salmon migrate thousands of miles, U.S. and Canadian fishermen compete for many of the same fish. The massive reduction of Canada's commercial fleet is ``a good sign that Canadians are finally prepared to make conservation sacrifices,'' says Don Stuart, a longtime advocate for Washington's salmon fishermen.<P>

   Canada's plan does signal a shift in the way it manages the salmon fishery. But whether it will result in long-term conservation remains to be seen. Likewise, it's unclear whether it will lessen the considerable tension over the allocation of fish under the Pacific Salmon Treaty.<P>

   Despite assurances from federal Fisheries Minister Fred Mifflin that ``the fish come first,'' Canada's plan to buy back commercial salmon licenses does not ensure fewer salmon will be caught off British Columbia's coast. That's a problem from the U.S. perspective.<P>

   ``We'll benefit only if Canada reduces the harvest along with the fleet,'' said Rob Zuanich, executive director of the Purse Seine Vessel Owners Association in Seattle. ``If they continue to catch the same numbers, we'll continue to face the same problems.''<P>

   If Canada's goal is conservation of salmon, then its plan is flawed -- in part because it's voluntary and, so far, few fishermen are rushing to accept their government's offer.<P>

   ``Since 1959, I fish here. Now the government wants me to wash my boat and sell it. . . . I will not,'' said John Katnic, skipper of the C.F. Todd, a 72-foot boat equipped with high-tech fish-finding gear and huge nets.<P>

   ``Maybe I eat scrap fish and cornmeal rest of my life but, so long as I can stay on my feet, I fish.''<P>

   Although most Canadian fishermen agree there are too many boats on the water, they're angry the government isn't offering more in return for sacrificing livelihood and lifestyle.<P>

   ``There's no offer of job retraining, no offer to buy a man's boat. . . . What's a fishermen without a fishing license going to do with a boat? Sink it in the back yard and plant flowers in it?'' asked John Katnich, Vancouver waterfront organizer for United Fishermen & Allied Workers Union. ``Why would anybody sell?''<P>

   Officials hope to induce fishermen to sell by putting new limits on their licenses. Instead of entitling fishermen to chase salmon along the length of Canada's west coast, a license will be good for only half the area. Fishermen who can afford it will be allowed to buy a second license and continue to fish the entire coast.<P>

   Phil Eby, executive director of British Columbia's Vessel Owners Association, says most fishermen will be priced off the water:<P>

   ``Before this announcement, a second license cost around $300,000 [Canadian] . . . already that cost is going up. A bidding war has started and, believe me, darn few fishermen can win against the government.''<P>
