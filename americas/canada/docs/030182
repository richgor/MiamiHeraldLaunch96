<ue5><m0>Bouchard calls elections to fill 2 empty seats<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>QUEBEC <m0>(--) Premier Lucien Bouchard has called two by-elections for June 10, one of which is to fill the seat left empty by his predecessor, Jacques Parizeau.<ep>
   Parizeau's L'Assomption riding northeast of Montreal has been vacant since Parizeau officially resigned his seat last Jan. 29.<ep>
   The other by-election will be in the Montreal riding of Outremont. That seat was left vacant when Liberal Gerald Tremblay quit politics last month.<ql>

<ue5><m0>Ontario to make Quebec's budget look bad<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>QUEBEC <m0>(--) Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves has put Quebec in a bind.<ep>
   His budget on Tuesday cut income taxes for individuals and businesses while reducing the Ontario deficit. Quebec's budget (--) to be delivered today (--) will probably only trim the deficit.<ep>
   ``What the Ontario budget did is show it's possible to focus on deficit reduction while stimulating the economy through tax measures,'' said Pierre Cleroux, a spokesman for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.<ep>
   Premier Lucien Bouchard has painted himself as a deficit-chopper with a heart. He has promised no income tax increases in his first budget as premier. But Quebec's fiscal woes are too deep for tax cuts.<ep>
   Quebec is projecting a $3.2 billion deficit for the 1996-97 fiscal year, but it must find $600 million on top of $1.1 billion in cuts already announced.<ql>

<ue5><m0>Small quake in Niagara area shakes ground<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>HAMILTON, Ontario <m0>(--) A minor earthquake in the Niagara area was felt in Hamilton and Burlington early Wednesday.<ep>
   The quake at 2:28 a.m. registered 2.5 on the Richter scale, a level that reportedly caused no damage but noticeably shook the ground.<ep>
   The epicenter was under Lake Ontario, about 35 miles east of Hamilton.<ep>
   ``This is a small earthquake with no damage associated with it,'' said Janet Drysdale, a seismologist with the Geological Survey of Canada.<ql>

<ue5><m0>Executive landed Paris job amid cutbacks<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>MONTREAL <m1> <m0>(--) A Hydro Quebec executive has been on loan to a utilities association in Paris for two years while provincial taxpayers pick up the yearly $215,000 tab.<ep>
   Claude Durand, a director of the hydro's equipment division before he moved to Paris with his family, works as a senior adviser to the International Union of Producers and Distributors of Electrical Energy.<ep>
  The arrangement to lend Durand was made as Hydro Quebec cut thousands of jobs over the last two years and as its profits fell by half in 1995.<ep>
   Durand refused to comment. He was sent to France on loan in 1994 for a two-year stint, but his appointment was extended to June 1997, Hydro spokesman Yvan Cliche said.<ep>
   Cliche defended the posting.<ep>
   ``It allows us to network and create alliances with foreign utilities, which eventually leads to new business.''<ql>

<ue5><m0>Stocks fall amid forecasts of rising rates<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>TORONTO <m0>(--) Canadian stocks fell for the first time in four sessions as expectations of rising interest rates attracted investors to bonds and away from equities, analysts said.<ep>
   Canadian Pacific, BCE and gold stocks led the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index down 6.27 points to 5160.80.<ep>
   ``Yields keep creeping up, so it's hard for the market to gain,'' said Steve Bokor, a portfolio manager at Majendie Securities.<ep>
   During the past few months, reports of stronger economic performance and rising commodity prices have ignited concern that the rate of inflation will accelerate and push rates higher soon.<ep>
 The U.S. dollar closed Wednesday at C$1.3663; the Canadian dollar closed at U.S. 73.19 cents.<ql>
