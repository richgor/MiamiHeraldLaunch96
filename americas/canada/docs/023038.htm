<H2>Deputy minister quits over tax</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 OTTAWA -- Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps resigned from parliament Wednesday in a controversy over the government's change in the national value-added tax.<P>

   Her resignation marks the third loss in the ruling Liberal Party ranks in the past 10 days because of proposed changes to the national 7 percent goods and services tax.<P>

   Two Toronto-area members of parliament left the Liberal Party last week, accusing Chretien of not living up to his 1993 electoral pledge to get rid of the GST. Copps promised on the campaign trail to resign if the Liberal government didn't ``scrap and abolish'' the GST.<P>

   In a news conference last week, Copps said the remark was ``shooting from the lip'' under the stress of the campaign.

   Justice Minister Allan Rock introduced the amendment Monday. It would add sexual orientation to the list of prohibited grounds for discrimination along with race, religion, age, sex, marital status and disability.<P>

   Reform MP Bob Ringma has drawn criticism for his remarks that it should be OK to fire blacks or homosexuals if they're hurting a business. He later apologized for the statements.

 WINNIPEG -- Several hundred Montrealers have responded to a promotion offering a free weekend in Winnipeg.<P>

   The city of Winnipeg ran an advertisement in The Montreal Gazette touting Winnipeg's attributes and offering two Montrealers a chance to win a weekend to the city some call Winter-peg.<P>

   The campaign was prompted by an earlier promotion in the Gazette that belittled the Manitoba capital.<P>

   The Gazette ads told Montrealers if they didn't feel good about Montreal after reading the newspaper's series on that city, they should spend a week in Winnipeg.<BR>
