<H2>Eleven arrested, four cops hurt in downtown riot at tourist site</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   QUEBEC -- Cars were damaged and windows broken early Saturday in a three-hour riot touched off when police tried to arrest several people for setting a fire in a street in the city's historic Old Town, a popular tourist area.<P>

   Police used tear gas and fired pepper spray into the rioters several hours after the trouble began, said police spokesman Jean Eudes Lachance. Eleven people were arrested and four police officers were injured, most with cuts from being hit with rocks and bottles.<P>

   Another police spokesman said the trouble began when police tried to break up a crowd of about 1,500 young people who had set a large fire in the street. Police tried to arrest several of the youths but the crowd responded by throwing rocks at the officers.

<H2>Author: Mowat's research into Inuits, wolves is fiction</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   In the latest issue of Saturday Night magazine, journalist John Goddard says Farley Mowat did not conduct the Arctic research he described in his books Never Cry Wolf, People of the Deer  and The Desperate People.<P>

   Goddard's heavily document article includes assertions that Mowat:<P>

   <LI> Did not spend two years in the Keewatin District of the Far North, as his books say, but was there for less than six months.<P>

   <LI> Never set foot in an Inuit camp and did not once see a starving Inuit person.<P>

   <LI> Spent only 90 hours over a period of less than four weeks studying wolves and did not live with the wolves but commuted daily from a cabin he shared with another man.<P>

   Mowat, 74, replied Saturday: ``For a guy who is sanctimoniously devoted to facts, this guy's got . . . as many facts wrong as there are flies on a toad that's road kill.''

<H2>Police think they've caught the killer who was taunting them</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   ABBOTSFORD, B.C. -- A man was charged Saturday in the case of an accused killer who taunted police by defacing the gravestone of a girl he had bludgeoned to death.<P>

   Police charged Abbotsford resident Terry Driver, 31, with first-degree murder in the death of Tanya Smith, 16, who was beaten with a baseball bat and dumped into a river seven months ago.<P>

   Among the phrases scrawled on her gravestone were ``I'm looking for more'' and ``I'm still out there.''<P>

   Driver was also charged with attempted murder in connection with the beating of Smith's friend, 16-year-old Misty Cockerill.<P>

   Driver was arrested Friday night in the police station after he went there with his lawyer.

<H2>Buried cocaine stash allegedly linked to arrested Outlaws leader</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
    TORONTO -- Police say they have found a stash of buried cocaine on a farm near Niagara Falls that is allegedly linked to an Outlaws Motorcycle Club leader.<P>

   Sgt. Mark Carter said officers seized the drugs on the farm that is apparently home to Mario Parente, president of the St. Catharines Outlaws. He was arrested Monday.<P>

   Parente was charged with drug trafficking and threatening death. He remains in custody pending the outcome of his bail hearing, which is scheduled to resume Monday in Hamilton.

<H2>Manitoba meets some of guards' safety concerns after jail riot</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   WINNIPEG -- Officials on Saturday met some of the demands of guards who threatened to stay away from work at Headingley jail because of safety concerns at the riot-torn prison.<P>

   The Manitoba government will install a million-dollar electromagnetic locking system to replace one master key that was used to open cells and barriers in many different areas of the burned-out jail.<P>

   And range bars dividing large parts of the jail won't be removed at the Depression-era building, the scene of a bloody rampage last week.<P>

   Guards say it's a start but not enough. They still want a full public inquiry and the resignation of senior justice officials. They said they still might walk off the job.

<H2>Samples of hay fever drug believed diluted, then sold</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   TORONTO -- An investigation has been launched into how at least 160 physician samples of a prescription allergy medicine ended up diluted and on sale in pharmacies.<P>

   Thousands of bottles of Rhinalar, manufactured by Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd. in Mississauga, Ontario, were recalled last week after two consumers complained the treatment for hay fever wasn't working.<P>

   Lorenzo Biondi, a spokesman for the company, said tests by the federal Health Protection Branch found no evidence of any illicit drugs or known poisons in the medicine. ``It could just be water,'' he said.<P>

   So far, the company has found 160 bottles that have been tampered with, he said.

<H2>Teen `terrorist' is charged in rape, pellet-gun shootings</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   HAMILTON -- A 15-year-old boy has been charged with more than 20 serious crimes, including the rape of a 14-year-old girl.<P>

   ``This is a little terrorist,'' police Sgt. Dennis Waddle said.<P>

   The boy is charged with attacking six girls ages 13 to 15. One of them was raped. The others were injured by shots fired from a pellet gun. The three-month string of crimes terrorized residents of an east Hamilton apartment building.<P>

   The boy is charged with four counts of assault with a weapon, breaking and entering, and theft. Other charges include sexual assault, forcible confinement, careless use of a firearm, possession of a dangerous weapon, assault and mischief. A second 15-year-old boy, who allegedly kept the rape victim from escaping, is charged with sexual assault and forcible confinement.
