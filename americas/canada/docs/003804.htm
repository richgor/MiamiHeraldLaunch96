<H2>Hundreds attend funeral for officer slain on duty</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
  ST-EUSTACHE, Quebec -- Hundreds of police officers from all over North America gathered Friday for the funeral of a Montreal constable fatally shot as he stopped a motorist on a routine traffic check.<P>

   The officers crowded into the Eglise St-Eustache church in this community north of Montreal to pay last respects to Andre Lalonde.<P>

   Lalonde, 51, was gunned down Monday morning on a quiet residential street in the Montreal suburb of Senneville.<P>

   Lalonde, who was to retire at the end of this year, was shot three times. Police think he had stopped the motorist because of a noisy muffler.<P>

    Police arrested a man Wednesday and questioned him in connection with the killing. He has not been charged in the death but was charged with armed robbery.

<H2>Taxi driver dies 29 months after beating by police</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 MONTREAL -- A Montreal taxi driver who was beaten into unconsciousness while in police custody 29 months ago has died.<P>

   Richard Barnabe, 41, died Thursday evening from internal bleeding, his sister Claudette said Friday.<P>

   The cabbie collapsed in police cells in December 1993 after being arrested for leading police on a wild car chase when they responded to a broken church window in nearby Laval. Barnabe was unconscious when he was admitted to the hospital and he remained there in a vegetative state until he died.<P>

   Four Montreal police officers were convicted of assault causing bodily harm. They are appealing the verdict and have not served any time in jail. A fifth officer was acquitted.

<H2>Guards demanding resignation, public inquiry over jail riot</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 WINNIPEG -- Guards at Headingley Jail, the site last week of a bloody 24-hour riot, are demanding the province call a public inquiry and the Manitoba justice minister resign.<P>

   About 250 of the guards met Thursday night before submitting a letter of their demands Friday. They want their demands met within 48 hours or some say they will not return to work at the ravaged jail.

<H2>Victim's families appeal ruling to allow pornographic evidence</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 TORONTO -- The families of two girls killed by Paul Bernardo have appealed a judge's dismissal of their bid to bar the public and media from courtrooms when pornographic evidence is presented.<P>

   ``First and foremost we are dealing with Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French, but the argument that we made would apply to all Canadian women and Canadian children,'' lawyer Tim Danson said Friday.<P>

   The appeal of the ruling by Justice Patrick Gravely was filed with the Ontario Court of Appeal. The French and Mahaffy families complained to Gravely that their rights were violated each time videotapes of Bernardo raping the girls was played at his trial last summer.<P>

   ``It's too late for us,'' Leslie Mahaffy's mother, Debbie, said Friday. But she said other families shouldn't have to go through the suffering.<P>

   Gravely had ruled that it is up to individual judges to bar the public from seeing evidence.<BR>

<H2>U.S. jobs report reassures stock market on interest rates</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
  TORONTO -- Canadian stocks rose after a U.S. jobs report eased concern that inflation will accelerate and cause interest rates to rise soon, analysts said.<P>

   Alcan Aluminium Ltd., Newbridge Networks Corp. and Canadian Pacific Ltd. led the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index up 7.31 points to 5124.50.<P>

   Stocks gained after the Labor Department said the U.S. economy created 2,000 nonfarm jobs in April, much less than the 117,000 forecast by analysts.<P>

   A rise in interest rates by the United States -- Canada's largest trading partner -- likely would prompt an increase in Canadian rates.<P>

   The U.S. dollar closed Friday at C$1.3652; the Canadian dollar closed at U.S. 73.25 cents.

<H2>Premier Bouchard to try to sell Americans on Quebec during visit</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
  QUEBEC -- Premier Lucien Bouchard will try to sell Americans on investing in Quebec when he visits New York next month.<P>

    Bouchard will deliver a speech June 3 to the Foreign Policy Association.<P>

   The trip to New York is, in part, an attempt to assuage jittery international investors on Quebec's political future, but it also has domestic ramifications.<P>

   After Quebec businessmen complained earlier this year that the prospect of another sovereignty referendum was hurting investment, Bouchard promised he would try to help.

<H2>Largest labor groups agree to end their 14-year feud</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
 OTTAWA -- Canada's largest labor groups kissed and made up Friday, ending a sometimes bitter 14-year feud.<P>

   The 2 million-member Canadian Labor Congress and the smaller Canadian Federation of Labor signed a cooperation agreement committing them to fight unemployment and economic policies that create it.<P>

   ``Inter-union disputes within the labor movement waste resources which could be better spent elsewhere,'' said Jim McCambly, president of the 215,000-strong federation.<P>

   McCambly helped create the federation in 1982, when several building trades unions broke away from the Labor Congress in a dispute about unions raiding each other for members.
