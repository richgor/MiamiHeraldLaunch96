   TORONTO -- Lucien Bouchard was on the brink of death after being struck down by flesh-eating disease in 1994 and may have been saved by a new procedure involving ``a kind of antibody cocktail,'' his doctors have disclosed.<P>

   An article describing the case in the U.S. magazine Clinical Infectious Diseases does not identify Bouchard. However, his doctors confirmed that it was about the former Bloc Quebecois leader and current premier of Quebec, The Toronto Star and The Toronto Globe and Mail reported Saturday.<P>

   The doctors said they asked for Bouchard's permission to publish the text in a specialized magazine because they thought it could help other doctors and their patients.<P>

   After losing his left leg to the disease, Bouchard had low blood pressure, blood that didn't coagulate, and badly functioning kidneys and liver.<P>

   In an attempt to stabilize him, doctors gave Bouchard massive doses of antibiotics and 12.8 liters of blood over a 24-hour period, more than double the five liters of blood normally in the body.<P>

   However, the bacteria continued its deadly progress, so doctors decided to operate to clean tissues under the skin of Bouchard's side and armpit.<P>

    During the procedure, Bouchard's blood pressure dropped to 80 over 0 (normal is 120 over 80) and his pulse shot up to 140 beats a minute, about double the normal rate.<P>

   ``The danger was that the toxic shock could become irreversible'' causing death, said microbiologist Francois Lamothe.<P>

   After the operation, Bouchard's doctors, led by Patrick D'Amico, decided to inject him with immunoglobulins, ``a kind of antibody cocktail produced from the blood of several donors.''<P>

   Lamothe said doctors can't say for sure if the antibody mixture saved Bouchard's life but that the full procedure -- surgery, antibiotics and immunoglobulins -- has since been used several times in Canada.<P>

   It's estimated the procedure reduces the mortality rate for flesh-eating disease from 80 percent to less than 40 percent.<P>

   ``What is important about this case is that it suggests [the antibody mixture] has a therapeutic effect and should be used more widely to treat toxic shock,'' Lamothe said.
