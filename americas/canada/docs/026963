<ue5><m0>Legislature rejects ban on gas additive<ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>  <m0>QUEBEC <m0>(--) The provincial Legislature has turned thumbs down to a federal proposal to ban the use of MMT, a magnesium-based additive that improves the quality of gasoline.<ep>
   The legislation was unanimously condemned Wednesday. Ottawa argues the legislation would lead to less pollution.<ep>
   Guy Chevrette, minister of natural resources, said refineries would be required to replace the additive with other substances or make extensive changes to the way they process gasoline. He said that would lead to higher gasoline prices.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>TORONTO <m0>(--) Canadian stocks took their biggest drop in two months as signs of a more-robust economy fueled concern that interest rates will rise and crimp share prices.<ep>
   Canadian Pacific, Seagram Co. and Bank of Montreal led the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index down 33.94 points to 5117.20.<ep>
   Three U.S. reports Thursday indicated economic growth in Canada's largest trading partner may be robust enough to accelerate inflation, lowering corporate profit and share prices.<ep>
 The U.S. dollar closed Thursday at C$1.3621; the Canadian dollar closed at U.S. 73.42 cents.<ql>

<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>  <m0>WINNIPEG <m0>(--) The provincial government is selling the Manitoba Telephone System through a public share offering.<ep>
   The province expects to receive between $700 million and $750 million through the share offering. Employees and Manitoba residents will get first crack at the shares.<ep>
   Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon said it was necessary for the company to change its structure in order to compete in the rapidly changing communications world.<ep>
   ``The old MTS is about to pass into the history books,'' he said. ``The days when it can afford to be a simple telephone company are long gone.''<ql>
