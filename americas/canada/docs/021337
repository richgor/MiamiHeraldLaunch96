<m0>  Prime Minister Jean Chretien's scuffle with a protester has led to an assault charge but he won't have his day in court.<ep>
  Kenneth Russell, who said his profession is ``fighting government,'' had Chretien charged with assault over the February incident when Chretien grabbed a protester by the neck.<ep>
  Russell, of New Brunswick, used an obscure section of the Criminal Code that allows a person other than a victim to ask the court to lay a charge.<ep>
  He told Judge Pierre Chevalier of Quebec Court that Chretien, ``in my opinion, broke the law.'' Chevalier ruled that Chretien should face the charge in court on June 6.<ep>
  But within two hours, Quebec Justice Minister Paul Begin used another legal option to stay proceedings against Chretien, saying the victim, Bill Clennett, didn't want to proceed with a charge. Clennett was compensated for dental work from injuries when Mounties wrestled him to the ground.<ep>
  Chretien joked about the run-in at last week's Parliamentary Press Gallery dinner.<ep>
  ``When the guy Bill Clennett jumped in front of me I thought he was John Nunziata, so I took him out,'' Chretien said, referring to the politician he recently expelled from the Liberal Party for opposing a government tax.<ql>
<m0>Gay rights bill approved<ep>
<m0>  Canada's Parliament approved a bill endorsing gay rights after two weeks of debate.<ep>
  The 153-76 vote in the Commons enacts a long-standing promise by several governments to outlaw discrimination against homosexuals.<ep>
  Twenty-nine members of the governing Liberal Party opposed the bill, saying it will lead to benefits for gay couples, promote an unhealthy lifestyle and allow legalized pedophilia.<ep>
  The bill amends the Canadian Human Rights Act to include sexual orientation along with age, sex, race, religion and disability as prohibited grounds of discrimination.<ql>
<m0>From the west<ep>
<m0>  Hours after promising personal income tax cuts, Premier Glen Clark called a provincial election for May 28 in British Columbia. Voters have a choice ``between protecting Medicare and education with tax relief for the middle class, or cutting health care and education to pay for tax breaks for large corporations,'' the New Democratic premier said.<ep>
  Calgary socialite Dorothy Joudrie, 61, was found ``not criminally responsible'' because of her mental condition for shooting her estranged husband and business executive, Earl, 62, six times and seriously injuring him. She was ordered to undergo psychiatric assessment and treatment, if needed.<ep>
  <m0>In brief<ep>
<m0>  (box) The Ontario government is keeping a promise of a 30 percent provincial income tax break by announcing a first-stage, 15.5 percent cut effective July 1. Even though it's the first time in years taxes have been cut, there are critics who suggest the in-debt province can't afford it. Premier Mike Harris said the aim is to boost the economy and create jobs.<ep>
  (box) Quebec is attempting to get its financial affairs in order within two years to prepare for another run at seeking independence from Canada. The mainly French-speaking province will try to eliminate its deficit while sparing Quebecers income tax increases in the Parti Quebecois' budget.<ep>
