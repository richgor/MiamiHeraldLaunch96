<m0> <m0>OTTAWA <m0>(--) The House of Commons voted Thursday to add ``sexual orientation'' to the Canadian Human Rights Act, two words that have resulted in acrimonious debate and division within the parties.<ep>
   MPs voted 153-76 in favor of Bill C-33 during a free vote. The bill fulfills a decade-old promise by successive governments to outlaw discrimination against homosexuals.<ql>

<m0> <m0>CALGARY <m0>(--) Dorothy Joudrie, whose high-society marriage mixed wealth and privilege with abuse and alcoholism, was found not guilty Thursday by reason of mental illness of trying to kill her husband rather than face a divorce.<ep>
   Joudrie, 61, shot her estranged husband, oil executive Earl Joudrie, 62, six times in January 1995 at her Calgary home.<ep>
   But her lawyer argued she was in a robot-like state, unaware of what she was doing.<ql>

<m0> <m0>QUEBEC <m0>(--) Finance Minister Bernard Landry looked ahead to sovereignty Thursday, tabling a budget he says will prepare Quebec's finances for independence but also signaling that he's serious about deficit reduction.<ep>
   Landry spared Quebecers income tax increases but targeted big business as he announced the province's deficit would be chopped to $3.3 billion this year from $4 billion.<ep>
   The province has come under strong pressure from bond-rating agencies to clean up its finances.<ql>

<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0> <m0>QUEBEC <m0>(--) Ottawa will likely announce today whether it will join a court case that challenges Quebec's right to unilaterally declare its sovereignty.<ep>
   ``It should be [Friday] because it's the deadline,'' said Stephane Dion, federal intergovernmental affairs minister.<ep>
   The court case, initiated by Quebec City lawyer Guy Bertrand, was a major topic of discussion between Dion and his provincial counterpart Jacques Brassard on Thursday.<ep>
   The Parti Quebecois government wants the case, which begins Monday in Quebec Superior Court, thrown out. It has warned that Ottawa's involvement would be considered a challenge to Quebec's right to decide its own political future.<ql>
