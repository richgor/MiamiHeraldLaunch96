<m0>   Former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney insisted that he's not a crook as he testified in a pretrial hearing in his libel suit against the government.<ep>
  ``I've never committed a crime in my life,'' an angered Mulroney, 57, said during testimony in his $50 million (Canadian) suit against the Canadian government and the police over allegations that he received millions of dollars in kickbacks from the purchase of aircraft. ``I am going to fight for my honor and my reputation.'' <ep>
  Mulroney accused the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of ``fascism'' in its investigation of alleged kickbacks from Air Canada's purchase of 34 Airbus planes in 1988.<ep>
  He launched the lawsuit in November after learning that the government sent a confidential letter to Swiss authorities seeking access to three bank accounts. It is also alleged that former Newfoundland Premier Frank Moores and businessman Karlheinz Schreiber were involved.<ep>
  ``Every single reference to me in this document is false,'' Mulroney said, waving it in the air.<ep>
  The Montreal hearing was the first time Mulroney spoke publicly about the incident and was the first time a prime minister has testified in court.<ql>
<m1>Facts and figures<ep>
<m0>  The Bank of Canada trimmed .25 percent from its key interest rate, now at 5 percent, and Canadian banks lowered their prime lending rate to 6.5 percent, causing the dollar to drift lower.<ep>
  The dollar closed Friday at 73.40 cents, while a U.S. dollar was $1.3623 Canadian (before exchange fees).<ep>
  Stock markets are higher, with Toronto's composite index at 5,069 points, Vancouver 1,161 points and Montreal 2,444 points.<ep>

<m1>In brief<ep>
<m0>  (box) The federal minimum wage of $4 an hour since 1986 is being adjusted to match each province's rate. That will increase the rate to a range of $4.75 an hour in Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island to $7 in British Columbia.<ep>
  (box) Canadians will stand up and be counted in May during a national census. The statistics gathered every five years will ask about gender, marital status and racial origin while selected households will receive a 55-question form covering demographics and lifestyles.<ep>
  (box) The layoffs and spending cuts by the Ontario government of Conservative Mike Harris continue to spark almost daily protest rallies. The biggest, attended by more than 10,000 trade unionists, was held Friday in Kitchener-Waterloo. <ep>
  (box) Eastern Canadians have become so tired of lingering wintry weather that Canada's ``official'' groundhog has received death threats. Wiarton Willie's keeper, Sam Brouwer, admits the hog was wrong Feb. 2 when he predicted an early spring, but he wasn't expecting threatening calls and letters.<ql>
