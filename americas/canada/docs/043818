<m0>  MONTREAL (--) A debt-ridden gambler took his own life Wednesday after killing his brother-in-law and wounding other family members who would not give him money, police said.<ep>
   Phun Van Vo, 27, who lost money at the Montreal Casino, often pressured his family to cover his debts, according to <m1> <m0>police.<ep>
   He went to his mother-in-law's apartment late Tuesday night and began firing a revolver when his plea for funds was turned down, police said.<ep>
   The gambler fled after killing Nelson Huy Nh, 34, and wounding his 65-year-old mother-in-law and a 29-year-old uncle. He then barricaded himself in another relative's basement. Police tried to force him out with tear gas.<ep>
    Police said Phun Van Vo was found dead in the basement, shot in the head, a gun next to him.<ql>
