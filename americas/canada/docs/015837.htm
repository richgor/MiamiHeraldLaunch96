<H2>Chretien called liar for not killing tax</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
<P>

   Tax-stressed Canadians have prompted political unrest in the Commons over unkept Liberal promises.<P>

  Prime Minister Jean Chretien was called a liar for failing to kill the federal goods and services tax, and Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps shrugged off her promise to resign if the tax wasn't eliminated.<P>

  Instead of death for the goods and services tax, Chretien is moving to consolidate the 7 percent federal levy with provincial sales taxes.<P>

  Chretien's pre-election pledge was a ``bald-faced lie,'' said Randy White, a British Columbia Reform politician, who was then ejected from the Commons for the day.<P>

  The prime minister said what he meant was his government would replace the tax with a fairer system. A ``harmonized'' 15 percent tax to include both federal and provincial levies has been approved so far for New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.<P>

  A bad-blood scandal that left thousands of Canadians infected in the 1980s has led to plans for creation of an independent agency for Canada's blood supply system.<P>

  Provincial health ministers approved the move as a bid to restore confidence in the system. A two-year inquiry is examining the tainted-blood tragedy and the role of the Red Cross.<P>

  Blood transfusions were blamed for infecting 1,200 Canadians with the AIDS virus and 12,000 people with hepatitis.<P>

   Federal Health Minister David Dingwall said less than half of the 280 identified deficiencies in the national blood system have been acted upon.   Canadian banks have dropped mortgage rates as low as 6.125 percent for six-month open terms as the key Bank of Canada rate dipped to 5 percent. The prime lending rate is 6.5 percent.<P>

  There was little change in the dollar, closing Friday at 73.43 cents while a U.S. dollar was $1.3618 Canadian (before exchange fees).<P>

  The Toronto Stock Exchange composite index was at a record high 5,148 points, while Vancouver was a record 1,214 points and Montreal 2,478 points.<P>

  Lotto 6-49: (Wednesday) 11, 12, 13, 14, 39 and 47; bonus 24. (April 20) 1, 16, 17, 30, 44 and 49; bonus 37.<BR>
  <LI> The credibility of Canada's military took another beating after an inquiry was told that Gen. Jean Boyle approved the release of altered documents about the actions of Canadian peacekeepers in the deaths of three Somali civilians. The inquiry is probing an alleged cover-up by the military in the 1993 Somalia mission.<P>

  <LI> Canada's official groundhog remains in hiding after more death threats since the end of winter doesn't appear near in some places. Winnipeg, Thunder Bay, Ontario and Montreal had more snow and Toronto's high dropped to the 40s this weekend. Hog Wiarton Willie predicted an early spring.<BR>
