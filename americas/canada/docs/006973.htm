   OTTAWA -- Attempts by the Reform Party to pin a contempt of Parliament charge on a Bloc Quebecois member of Parliament may be a waste of time for a Commons committee, says Liberal whip Don Boudria.<P>

   Committee members must decide whether Jean-Marc Jacob was in contempt when he sent a letter Oct. 26 to Quebec bases encouraging soldiers to join a Quebec army if the separatist side won the referendum.<P>

   Both the Liberals and the Bloc seem fed up with the committee process.<P>

   The Bloc plans to present a motion when the committee meets again next week demanding that Jacob's ``trial'' be ended immediately.<P>

   And Boudria appeared exasperated Thursday, saying Reform MPs can't agree on their accusations.<P>

   ``It needs to be clarified for me. I don't want to say it's a waste of time, but it's certainly less meaningful than before,'' he said after Jacob appeared for the first time as a witness.<P>

   Jacob told the committee he sent the communique because many Quebec soldiers didn't seem to be aware that separatist policy called for a Quebec army after separation and many of them were worried about their jobs.<P>

   Jacob said he was trying to reassure them there would be work for them in a Quebec army.<P>

   ``That I could be accused of contempt of Parliament is exaggerated,'' he said.<P>

   Reform MP Jack Frazer told Jacob he never thought his letter was advocating the use of force to bring about Quebec separation.<P>

   He later denied his position is at odds with Jim Hart, the Reform MP who first brought the complaint against Jacob.<P>

   Jacob probably could not legally be charged with sedition, but his communique was ``inviting people to relinquish their obligation to Canada and transfer it to Quebec,'' Frazer said outside the committee room.<P>

   He said the committee must make it clear that it's inappropriate for an MP to send such a communique because there likely will be another referendum campaign.<P>

   Jacob's appearance was in sharp contrast to Hart's testimony last week when Hart came under fire from Liberal and Bloc MPs.<P>

   Hart complained Thursday that the Liberals on the committee were giving Jacob an easy ride because they're afraid of offending the separatist movement in Quebec.<P>

   ``As a Canadian, that makes me feel very frustrated,'' he said after Jacob's testimony.<P>

   Hart said he still believes that Jacob ``flirted with sedition.'''<P>

   He said he's also angry that Jacob, as the Bloc defense critic, has been getting invitations to speak at Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, and with visiting foreign dignitaries.<P>

   Jacob tabled a speaking invitation he received from the Kingston college less than two months ago and invitations from Argentina and South Africa to meet defense officials visiting Ottawa.<P>

   ``I'm outraged,'' Hart said.
