<m0>   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (--) (AP) (--) A prison uprising ended late Friday when more than 300 inmates surrendered and police took the final eight holdouts into custody inside a riot-demolished cellblock. <ep>
   The detentions ended a daylong standoff that injured dozens of people and trashed Manitoba's largest jail. <ep>
   Inmates took over Headingley provincial jail near Winnipeg Thursday night when they overpowered guards who were conducting a search for drugs, police said. At least eight guards were beaten and hospitalized. None of the injuries was life-threatening.<ep>
   The prisoners set fires and destroyed equipment. They seized drugs from the infirmary and used hammers and makeshift clubs to attack other inmates.<ep>
   One man had his fingers cut off during the rebellion, said Brian Robinson, police site commander at the jail. He discounted earlier reports of death and castration.<ep>
   ``The stories of castration are incorrect,'' he said. ``Some people have received minor cuts and scratches in the groin area.''<ep>
   Robinson said the burned-out jail would not reopen for at least a month.<ep>
   ``There's no light, there's no heat and there's lots of damage and water, burnt mattresses, burnt clothing,'' he said. ``When you walk in the area, you're walking in maybe three to four inches of water.''<m2><ep>
