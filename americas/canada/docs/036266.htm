<H2>Deputy prime minister resigns over sales tax</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->

   A broken promise to scrap an unpopular federal sales tax has cost Canada's Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps her job.<P>

  Under increasing public pressure, Copps made good on an election promise to resign as a member of Parliament if the Liberal government didn't dump the goods and services tax.<P>

  ``I gave my word and I will keep my word,'' Copps told Prime Minister Jean Chretien after shrugging off demands she resign as the government moves to combine the federal tax with provincial sales taxes, not kill it.<P>

  Chretien, also called a liar over his government's failure to end the tax begun by the previous Conservative government, said a by-election will be held June 17 in Copps' Hamilton district. <P>

  Copps is asking the public to support her re-election bid. Polls indicate the popular outspoken politician will win easily, but the exercise will cost $800,000 (Canadian) for the election.<P>

  A week earlier, maverick politician John Nunziata was kicked out of the Liberal Party for voting against the government over the issue. He and Copps are former members of the Liberal ``rat pack'' who tormented the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney over such issues.<P>

  It has been a tough week for politicians as British Columbia's Bob Ringma quit as Reform Party whip for making disparaging comments about gays and blacks. In Ontario, Bill Vankoughnet, 53, quit the Conservative caucus after being arrested for propositioning a female police officer posing as a prostitute.<P>

   The 7-year-old son of a Toronto woman who made up a story about dying of cancer and being robbed of her purse will receive $20,000 (Canadian) of the $114,000 donated to her by the public. Donna Mercier's Easter hoax prompted a sympathetic outpouring of money and gifts from the public.<P>

  After her arrest for mischief, police decided to poll Toronto residents to decide what to do with the money. Those polled felt Mercier's son should get a portion of the money with the balance going to charities.<P>

  About 250 people have asked for their donations, amounting to about $20,000, to be returned.<P>

  Lax policies in which guards are encouraged to act like social workers are blamed for the riot by inmates who destroyed the Headingley Correctional Institute near Winnipeg a week ago. A guard and prisoner were seriously injured while convicted rapists and sex offenders were beaten.<P>

  Added security features including fences will be installed at the 6-month-old Edmonton prison for women after seven escapes in 18 days.<P>

  The dollar and stock markets have lost value as Canadian interest rates remain steady.<P>

  Canada's dollar closed Friday at 73.23 cents while a U.S. dollar was $1.3655 Canadian (before exchange fees).<P>

  Stock exchanges retreated from record highs, with Toronto's composite index at 5,124 points, Vancouver, 1,281 points, and Montreal, 2,472 points.<P>

  The key Bank of Canada rate is 5 percent while the prime lending rate is 6.5 percent.<P>

  Lotto 6-49: (Wednesday) 30, 32, 39, 40, 42 and 44; bonus 29. (April 27) 10, 23, 38, 42, 44 and 49; bonus 19.<P>

  Ontario drinkers and gamblers are cheering. The provincial government is allowing bars to serve liquor an extra hour until 2 a.m. and beer prices will be partially deregulated. Also approved is the opening this fall of a gambling casino in Niagara Falls.<P>

  Recent deaths include: Clara Smallwood, 94, widow of Premier Joey Smallwood, who led Newfoundland into Canadian Confederation in 1949; Jean Allard, 82, of Toronto, who as chief of defense staff in the 1960s, oversaw unification of Canada's armed forces; and theater artistic director Clarke Rogers, 48, of Flesherton, Ontario.
