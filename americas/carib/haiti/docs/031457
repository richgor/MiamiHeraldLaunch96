   PORT-AU-PRINCE (--) Former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide broke a three-month public silence Friday by criticizing his successor's plan to privatize inefficient state companies.<ep>
   While not directly opposing President Rene Preval's privatization proposal, Aristide said that such a policy ``has never improved the lot of citizens of any country.''<ep>
   The United States and international financial institutions have linked millions of dollars in aid to Haiti's acceptance of the plan.<ep>
   Aristide, in his first public remarks since leaving office Feb. 7, called for more debate on the issue during an interview with the Haitian Press Agency that was broadcast on Haitian radio.<ep>
   A Haitian political analyst dismissed the significance of Aristide's comments, noting that his position on privatization had been known since last August, when as president he refused to endorse an agreement that Prime Minister Smarck Michel had negotiated with international financial agencies. The agreement included privatization of nine targeted state enterprises.<ep>
   The same analyst said Aristide's position on the issue would probably carry little influence unless he called his followers into the streets to protest.<ep>
   A foreign economist in Haiti noted that Aristide said when he left office that he would refrain from public comment for three months. The three months were up this week, suggesting that he might now begin to openly criticize the Preval government.<ep>
   Friday's comment, the foreign economist said, ``is no different from his position since August, but here it is seen as him coming back in a public forum at a particularly delicate period for Preval.''<ep>
   A foundation set up by Aristide produced comments critical of privatization at its first forum in March. He has also been linked to a new political party that is opposed to privatization.<ep>
   In addition, Aristide's followers were responsible for an anti-privatization rally by a few hundred demonstrators May 1.<ep>
   Preval began negotiations last month for a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which would include privatization.<ep>
   The United States has tied $36 million in aid to Haiti's willingness to investigate political and other killings committed during Aristide's administration.<ep>
   An additional $4.6 million in 1995 assistance is on hold because Haiti has not met conditions on privatization and civil service reform.<ep>
