   WASHINGTON -- A supervisor of the U.S.-funded team trying to clean up and organize Haiti's judicial system was a convicted felon who once was disbarred as a lawyer, The Herald has learned.<P>

   James Patrick Smith resigned under pressure last month after officials of the U.S. Agency for International Development and its Washington-based contractor, Checchi & Co., learned of his past. The matter was handled quietly, apparently to avoid embarrassing the Clinton administration, which has spent nearly $2 billion to shore up Haiti's fledgling democracy.<P>

   ``I can understand it from their perspective,'' Smith said in a telephone interview from his California home. ``Everybody in Washington was running scared. They thought it would look bad that someone who had been disbarred should be working to fix the justice system.''<P>

   Until his resignation took effect April 1, Smith was responsible for overhauling the payroll and personnel systems of Haiti's courts -- long burdened by corruption and scarce resources. He drew a salary of $271 a day -- a rate of about $71,000 a year -- received an additional 25 percent in hardship pay, and had his lodging and rental car paid for by the company.<P>

   In 1984, Smith was convicted on four counts of fraud for falsifying loan information while he worked as an auditor at a federal credit union. Sentenced to five years of probation, he was stripped of the right to practice law in 1986. He was readmitted to the bar in 1992.<BR>
   Executives at Checchi & Co., which holds a $10.4 million contract for judicial reform in Haiti over the next four years, said Smith was forced out because he had not told them about his past.<P>

   ``We certainly did not know about that,'' said Vincent Checchi Jr. ``We had absolutely no idea.''<P>

   There is no evidence that Smith mishandled funds while working in Haiti. Indeed, some colleagues praise him as an enthusiastic and likable worker, if somewhat naive. An Army reservist, Smith was assigned to the justice project after the 1994 U.S. military intervention in Haiti and was hired by Checchi last September.<P>

   AID spokesman Russell Porter said Smith's work was ``good, [but] . . . not outstanding.'' Porter said Smith was not fired because of his criminal record but because he lied in his job application about the salaries he had received in previous posts.<P>

   Smith acknowledged that he inflated his overall salary to receive the maximum AID rate for someone at his supervisory level. But he said he did it at the suggestion of another AID contractor -- an official from a company called Ronco -- for whom Smith worked briefly.<BR>
   When Checchi came calling, Smith said, he stuck to the story that he normally earned about $70,000 a year, even though he had never earned even half that amount before coming to Haiti.<P>

   Smith claims he was let go mainly for the sake of appearances. A delegation of congressional Republican staffers arrived in Haiti for a five-day visit beginning March 30. About two days before the visit, Smith said, he was off the job, told to leave quietly and talk to no one.<P>

   ``If they had their druthers, they would have had me on the next plane out,'' he said.<P>

   The Republican delegation later filed a blistering report that included criticism of U.S. progress in reforming Haiti's justice system.<P>

   ``Haiti's judicial system is almost completely dysfunctional,'' the staff report concluded. ``Despite more than $3 million in AID assistance [AID has programmed $18 million through Fiscal Year 1999] already obligated . . . even the most basic training and equipment needs remain unmet.''
