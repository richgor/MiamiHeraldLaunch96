   Cuban President Fidel Castro appears to have fatally misunderstood several U.S. messages on the issue of Cuban exile overflights of Havana in the weeks leading up to the shooting down of two Miami-based aircraft, U.S. sources say.<ep>
   Clinton administration officials used unprintable epithets to describe Castro's claim this week that ``the U.S. government at the highest levels'' had given him assurances before the shootdown that it would block exile flights into Cuban airspace.<ep>
   But U.S. sources with firsthand knowledge of U.S.-Cuban contacts around that time say Castro indeed misinterpreted, willfully or by mistake, Washington's assurances that it was working to halt the violations (--) taking them as a flat guarantee that the flights would stop.<ep>
   The question of U.S. assurances could be critical to an understanding of the incident, which killed four Miamians, sank U.S.-Cuban relations to their lowest point in years, and led to a U.S. tightening of sanctions on Cuba through the Helms-Burton Act.<ep>
   Castro appears to have given standing orders to his generals to intercept the flights in the belief it would never come to that, according to a top aide to former President Carter long active on Cuban issues.<ep>
   Such a version of the Feb. 24 shootdown was rejected by most U.S. officials and Cuba analysts as an absurd Cuban attempt to sidestep blame for four deaths and a blatant violation of international rules on civil aviation.<ep>
   No Cuban general would dare shoot down a civilian plane without Castro's on-the-spot permission, said Frank Calzon of Freedom House, a Washington-based democracy advocacy group.<ep>
   ``Murderers always blame someone else for their deeds,'' Calzon said. ``And now Castro is following a script he has used before (--) blame the United States.''<ep>
   Cuba's official version of the shootdown of the Brothers to the Rescue airplanes has changed little since the Feb. 24 incident.<ep>
   Despite published reports that U.S. intelligence agents have shown Cuban officials persuasive evidence the planes were shot over international waters, Havana continues to insist the incident took place in Cuba's airspace, U.S. aviation sources say.<ep>
   But while Havana for months blamed exiles almost exclusively for the incident, and seemed to go out of its way to avoid criticizing Washington, it now appears to be shifting propaganda gears and laying all the blame on the Clinton administration.<ep>
   ``Our mistake was having trusted the assurances we were given by the U.S. administration,'' Castro told CBS anchorman Dan Rather in an interview broadcast Tuesday.<ep>
<m1>Disavowing Castro<ep>
<m0>   U.S. officials bristle at Castro's claim and say Washington never could have offered Cuba such guarantees because the U.S. legal system does not allow preventive arrests or other authoritarian methods of halting activity before a crime is committed.<ep>
   ``Anyone familiar with U.S. law, anyone familiar with the U.S. government, knows that we would not have made such a promise because we could not have kept such a promise'' said Anne W. Patterson, deputy assistant secretary of state. <ep>
   Added one top U.S. official familiar with Cuban issues: ``Castro doesn't understand that Bill Clinton can't go into a court and harangue them for five hours until they throw a guy in jail.<ep>
   ``There's b.s. and propaganda in what Castro is doing, but there's also a misunderstanding, of the classic kind between states,'' the official added. ``When we reconstruct this period in U.S.-Cuban relations, we will find a significant amount of b.s. on the part of the Cubans but we will also find a significant level of misunderstanding.''<ep>
   Castro did not identify the U.S. officials on the ``highest levels'' during the Rather interview, during which he repeated past claims that he had issued standing orders to the military on the exile overflights but learned of the Feb. 24 shootdown only afterward.<ep>
<m1>Unexplained issue<ep>
<m0>   Intriguingly, he never explained how a U.S. guarantee of a complete halt to exile overflights had led to Cuba's decision to fire on Feb. 24.<ep>
   One possible explanation comes from Robert Pastor, a top aide to former President Carter and a respected Latin American expert with good contacts in Washington and Havana.<ep>
   ``The shootdown of the Brothers planes was an unconscionable act. But to prevent such tragedies in the future, it's helpful to analyze in some depth what happened and whether it may have been the result of misunderstandings,'' Pastor said.<ep>
   Pastor said that in talks with knowledgeable officials in the days following the shootdown, he was told that Castro had fatally misplayed his hand in using the perceived U.S. assurances to placate military officers angered by previous Brothers to the Rescue flights over Havana.<ep>
   ``If you feel that you've been given complete assurances that the flights have stopped, and you're feeling pressures from your own military and hard-liners . . . you tell the military to go ahead,'' Pastor said, ``believing in part that you have inside information that it isn't going to happen.''<ep>
   Castro may have felt unable to acknowledge the apparent misunderstanding before the Rather interview for fear of being seen as blaming his military and perhaps angering his officers, Cuba analysts speculated.<ep>
<m1>A signal to Clinton?<ep>
<m0>   But he's going public now, the analysts added, to signal President Clinton as he heads into the thick of his re-election campaign that the shootdown was not premeditated and that Cuba remains interested in improved bilateral relations.<ep>
   ``At least that's the perception of his message,'' one U.S. official said.<ep>
   U.S. intelligence officials, meanwhile, are fighting to avoid releasing all the evidence they have against Cuba to a United Nations agency investigating the shootdown because it might reveal intelligence-gathering methods, U.S. officials said.<ep>
   ``We're telling them, `what's the use of spending billions [of dollars] to gather this stuff if we can't use it at a critical moment like this?' '' said one exasperated U.S. official familiar with the dispute.<ep>
   Investigators from the U.N.'s International Civil Aviation Organization, based in Montreal, have already met with U.S. and Cuban officials, but the full agency is not expected to issue a final report to the U.N. Security Council until late this month.<ep>
