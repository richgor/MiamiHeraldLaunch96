<m0>   LUXEMBOURG (--) (AP) (--) The European Union is considering retaliation against the United States to protest new U.S. sanctions against Cuba that could harm EU companies doing business with Havana.<ep>
   The 15 EU foreign ministers meeting here said they were studying options to counter the so-called Helms-Burton Act, ``including possible retaliatory measures.'' They did not elaborate.<ep>
   Such a move could provoke a new trans-Atlantic trade conflict once the sanctions are put into effect. The EU ministers also said they may bring the dispute before the Geneva-based World Trade Organization.<ep>
   They said the act ``goes against international law and harms the rights and interests of the European Union in the trade and investment sectors.''<ep>
   The Helms-Burton Act allows Americans to sue foreigners who profit from properties confiscated by the Castro government. The law came in the wake of the downing of two Cuban-American civilian planes by Cuban fighters Feb. 24. It is aimed at discouraging international investment.<ep>
   Many U.S. trading partners have protested the act, saying the United States has no right to impose penalties on other countries' businesses for trading with Cuba.<ep>
