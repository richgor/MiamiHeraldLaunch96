PUJOL<BR>
<P>

   Frank E. Guerra-Pujol is a lawyer in San Juan, Puerto Rico.<BR>

T<BR>
HERE has been much commotion in Cuban-American circles in Miami, San Juan, and elsewhere since President Clinton changed his mind, after the Cuban Air Force shot down two unarmed American civilian aircraft, and ceremoniously signed into law the Helms-Burton bill.<P>

   In essence, Helms-Burton creates a federal cause of action that for the first time will allow U.S. nationals with claims on property in Cuba -- including Cubans who are now naturalized U.S. citizens -- to sue foreign companies ``trafficking'' in confiscated property. Accordingly, the conventional wisdom among the U.S. media and various political pundits is that U.S. policy toward Cuba is controlled by Cuban exiles in Miami and that Helms-Burton was drafted by, and for the benefit of, a self-interested lobby group of right-wing Cuban exiles.<P>

   The truth is, however, that Helms-Burton is patently unfair to Cuban Americans. It expressly prohibits Cuban exiles from pursuing claims on residential property. There is not a single legitimate reason for such a huge exception. The argument that to permit lawsuits over residential property would harm Cubans now living in the property is a non sequitur, because Helms-Burton does not provide the restitution of property as a remedy.<BR>
Law unfair to exiles<BR>
<P>

   For most Cuban exiles, including my family, the most valuable property taken from us was our family homes. The Castro regime systematically confiscated the homes of Cubans who were forced to leave the island. Helms-Burton not only denies us an effective remedy, it also allows rapacious foreign companies to violate with impunity the sanctum of those family homes. <P>

   The other drawback of Helms-Burton is that our remaining claims on other nonresidential property are also treated less favorably than the pre-existing claims of U.S. corporations that have been ``certified'' by the U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. In 1964 this commission was authorized to certify property claims of U.S. companies and citizens but not the claims of Cuban exiles. The commission eventually certified 5,911 claims amounting to $1.8 billion, excluding interest. <P>

   Unlike the holders of these certified claims, Cuban Americans will have to wait until Aug. 1, 1998, before they can pursue their claims. What kind of remedy is that?<P>

   Despite its shortcomings, Helms-Burton is still a first step in the right direction. No foreign firm doing business in Cuba should be allowed to benefit from the use of our property, especially when it is common knowledge that Castro stole it from us.
