<H2>Cuba broadcasts to move headquarters to Miami</H2>

   WASHINGTON -- With the flourish of a pen, President Clinton on Friday gave final authorization for Radio and TV Marti -- the U.S. government broadcasts to Cuba -- to relocate their headquarters to Miami.<P>

   The move, which was approved by lawmakers in the budget bill on Thursday, will eventually bring ``the entire operation'' of Cuba broadcasting -- and most of its roughly 200-member Washington staff -- to Miami, said Rolando Bonachea, acting director of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting.<P>

   ``This is an area with great resources and human talent in matters related to Cuba,'' Bonachea said in Miami Friday.<P>

   While advocates hailed the move for placing the stations at the heart of the Cuban exile community, critics voiced fears that it would sap the broadcasts' credibility among Cubans on the island by becoming a mouthpiece for certain exile leaders.<P>

   ``To the extent that Radio Marti is perceived as strictly an exile station under the control of a faction of the exile community, it loses its credibility and makes it easier for Castro's friends to kill the <BR>

station in the future,'' said Frank Calzon, Washington representative of the human rights group Freedom House.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   Approval of the move signaled a victory for Jorge Mas Canosa, the chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation, who helped establish Radio Marti 11 years ago and has served as chairman of the president's advisory board on Cuban broadcasts ever since.<P>

   ``Moving Radio and TV Marti to Miami will bring this important tool of public diplomacy closer to its listening audience and will allow the broadcasts to take great advantage of the unique resources here,'' Mas Canosa said in a statement.<P>

   Mas Canosa's triumph was multifaceted. In addition to winning the relocation from Washington to his home turf, provisions in the bill appeared likely to thwart an investigation into charges that certain exiles used the station to advance a political agenda. Mas Canosa was one of the subjects of that investigation.<P>

   Until now, the United States Information Agency had oversight for Radio and TV Marti. For nearly two years, USIA Inspector General Marian Bennett has investigated allegations of political reprisals and cronyism by Mas Canosa and his allies -- but failed to release the report.<P>

   Now, as part of a broad federal reorganization, the inspector general's job is eliminated and oversight has been transferred to the State Department.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   The new law also appears to jeopardize the jobs of Radio Marti's six-member research department by ordering a staff reorganization. The researchers, who have clashed repeatedly with Mas Canosa over what they see as his undue influence on the station, have appealed to USIA and union representatives to protect their jobs.<P>

   Despite such intrigue, backers of the move said it would save money and help the local economy. Congress approved $24.8 million for the stations this year. It was unclear whether they will receive additional funds for the move.<P>

   ``The move will benefit programming because of the immense human resources and expertise available in South Florida, result in substantial savings to the taxpayer, and is welcomed by the Miami business, civic and labor communities,'' said Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Miami Republican.<P>

   A 1995 General Accounting Office feasibility study on the move said the potential for savings exceeded $4.2 million a year. But the savings were based on a 25 percent reduction in staff, which today would amount to laying off roughly 50 employees.<P>

   Rep. David Skaggs, D-Col., a critic of Radio Marti, said it was ``nonsense'' to believe there would be savings by uprooting employees, studios and equipment and moving to a new locale.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

  Preparations for the move are already under way, although no site has yet been selected, station officials said. The technical operations director of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Michael Pallone, was in Miami Thursday, scouting possibilities.<P>

   The Miami bureau of Radio and TV Marti -- with roughly 30 employees -- recently settled into new offices at the Koger Center, a complex of federal buildings at Northwest 53rd Street and 87th Avenue. The site is not big enough to house the headquarters, officials said.<P>

   Bonachea, the acting director, said the broadcasts to Cuba -- widely heard there on shortwave radio -- would maintain ``great journalistic integrity,'' despite being further afield from federal scrutiny.<P>

   But former political prisoner Armando Valladares warned that the stations will inevitably ``succumb to exile politics'' and become ``one more station carrying the viewpoint of some exile group.''<BR>
