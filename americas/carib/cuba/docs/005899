<m0>   OAKLAND, Calif. (--) (AP) (--) Benjamin Treuhaft sent ``pianas to Havana.'' Now he may have to pay the piper.<ep>
   The piano tuner has shipped 23 pianos to Cuba through his ``Send a Piana to Havana'' campaign, and he has a permit from the Commerce Department to ship 126 more, plus 1 1/2 tons of parts.<ep>
   But the Treasury Department, which issues travel licenses to Cuba, has fined him $10,000, saying it's for money he earned rebuilding pianos when he visited Cuba in 1994 and spent $3,500 without federal authorization.<ep>
   Treuhaft acknowledge that he charged to tune pianos while in Cuba, but it amounted to less than $1 per job for what would cost about $75 in the United States. His five trips to Cuba left him $5,000 in debt, he said.<ep>
   ``One branch of government says it's OK to send humanitarian aid . . . Another government branch slaps me with a $10,000 fine,'' he said last week.<ep>
   The Oakland Tribune quoted an unidentified spokesperson for the Treasury Department as saying that Treuhaft knew he was wrong.<ep>
   ``If he's complaining that the [travel restriction] law exists, then he can join the crowd,'' the official said. ``The law is clear, and it's the position of [the government] that he's run afoul of that law.''<ep>
   Treuhaft has 30 days to appeal.<ep>
