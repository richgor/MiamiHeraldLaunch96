<m0>   A Cuban court has sentenced an exile, Humberto Real Suarez, to death by firing squad for a murder after he and six other members of a Miami-based anti-Castro group slipped into Cuba in 1994.<ep>
    Real, 26, a member of the Democratic National Unity Party (PUND), was tried in the central city of Santa Clara for killing a Communist Party leader, Arcilio Rodriguez, after the PUND group landed on the north-central coast on what prosecutors called a mis<m4>Real<m2><ql>
<m0>sion of sabotage.<ep>
   The court sentenced Real to death and the six others to 30-year prison terms on Wednesday. The others were identified as Miguel Diaz Bouza, 43; Jesus Rojas, 51; Armando Sosa, 52; Jose Falcon, 28; Lazaro Gonzalez, 35; and Pedro Guisado, 35.<ep>
   Real's father, Humberto Real Ramos, told The Herald on Thursday that he is ``very proud'' of his son. ``People tell me that he is truly a man.''<ep>
   The chief prosecutor ``talked for about 2 1/2 hours,'' Real Ramos said, ``and she spent about two hours and 10 minutes talking only about my son, as if he were the only convict in the room.''<ep>
   Real Ramos and his wife, Graciela, who live in the northwest city of Matanzas, said they will ask President Fidel Castro to commute their son's death sentence and change it to 30 years imprisonment.<ep>
   Under Cuban law, all death sentences must be ratified by the Supreme Court as well as the Council of State in a process that generally takes several weeks.<ep>
<m1>Official account of events<ql>

<m0>       According to the prosecutors, the seven defendants arrived in Cuba aboard a speedboat with U.S. registration. They allegedly carried rifles, four pistols, ammunition and military equipment.<ep>
   Hours after landing, the official account says, the defendants were seen trying to steal a car driven by party leader Rodriguez. They were seized by Cuban soldiers after a shootout in which Rodriguez died and three of the infiltrators were slightly wounded.<ep>
   PUND's leaders in Miami reacted critically Thursday after hearing about the sentencing.<ep>
   ``It's just another assassination by the Castro government,'' said Sergio Gonzalez Rosquete, the group's secretary general.<ep>
   Gonzalez said Real couldn't have shot the party official with an AR-15 assault rifle, as charged by the prosecution, because Real didn't carry a weapon of that type.<ep>
   ``He was the youngest man in the team, and [the court] wanted to send a warning to the youth of Cuba,'' Gonzalez said. ``They chose him as a scapegoat.''<ep>

<m0>   Traditionally, the Cuban government has dealt severely with exiles who re-enter the island on commando raids. In 1991, it announced it had executed Eduardo Diaz Betancourt of Miami for allegedly entering Cuba to commit sabotage. In the years since, rumors have circulated that Diaz is alive and living in Oriente province.<ep>
   Diaz's companions, Daniel Santovenia and Pedro Alvarez Pedroso, are serving 30-year prison terms.<ep>
   Also in 1991, two infiltrators from Miami (--) Gustavo Sousa and Tomas Ramos of the Cuban Army of Liberation (--) were sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.<ep>
   And in mid-February of this year, three PUND members were captured in Matanzas, east of Havana, and are awaiting trial. They are Efrain Rivas, 33; Joel Cano, 34; and Marcelino Rodriguez, 52, all of Miami.<ep>
   In Havana this week, Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz, president of the Cuban Committee on Human Rights and National Reconciliation, offered the seven defendants moral support and legal assistance in their appeals.<ep>
   Committee lawyers said after reading the case file that there is insufficient evidence to prove that Real killed Rodriguez.<ep>
   Sanchez told The Herald on Thursday that he has appealed to Amnesty International and other international human rights organizations to plead for a commutation of Real's death sentence.<ep>
   PUND leader Gonzalez said Thursday in Miami that, if Real is executed, ``his death will not be in vain. We are not going to stop. The only thing Fidel Castro understands is war, belligerence.''<ep>
