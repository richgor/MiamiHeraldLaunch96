<H2>Cuba's No. 2: Beware of `the enemy'</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
By JUAN O. TAMAYO<BR>
Herald Staff Writer<P>

   Conventional wisdom among U.S. watchers of Cuban affairs has it that the government of President Fidel Castro shows no sign of erosion. But that's not the image painted recently by brother Raul Castro.<P>

   Raul, who commands the armed forces, delivered a 90-minute speech to a meeting of the Communist Party's ruling Central Committee March 23 -- the first in several years.<P>

   There'll be no rollback of recent economic reforms, Raul vowed. Self-employment and programs assigning public lands to private farmers will expand ``as part of the inevitable struggle for economic efficiency.''<P>

   But Raul spent two-thirds of his speech banging the drums on the myriad threats and dangers he believes the island faces: ``traitors inside the country,'' ``profiteers and thieves,'' foreign businessmen and even tourists.<P>

   Self-employment helps economic growth, Raul said, but ``the psychology of private producers . . . leads to individualism and is not a source of socialist awareness.''<P>

   High unemployment among youths ``led thousands of them, lacking perspective and the necessary patriotic awareness, down the path of economic migration,'' Raul added. Half the rafters in the 1994 crisis were under age 30.<P>

   ``The people's No. 1 daily concern is food,'' Raul said.<P>

   And be careful of foreign tourists, he cautioned, ``because they come from capitalism [and] are carriers of ideas from a consumer society. . . . There is no doubt this presents us with a challenge.''<P>

   The wave of Cuban Americans who visited Cuba in recent years, Raul added, ``from the point of view of ideological penetration . . . doubtless was harmful to a certain extent.''<P>

   Foreign businessmen in Cuba have not only increased corruption but are having an impact on the local people, Raul added, ``and even lead them to believe that capitalism is better, or at least not as bad as we describe it.''<P>

   The armed forces chief said a recent poll showed 13.5 percent of Communist Party members ``don't understand or agree'' with Cuba's recent economic reforms.<P>

   To such dangers, Raul said, ``we must add the political discouragement and confusion'' in Cuba that followed the collapse of the Soviet bloc.<P>

   So, as V.I. Lenin once put it, what is to be done?<P>

   Cuba cannot simply cut itself off from the big bad world and turn away foreign tourists or businessmen, Raul argued. Instead, the Communist Party must come up with appropriate answers to the challenges and explain them to Cuban citizens.<P>

   ``It is extremely important that we analyze the extent and the manner in which the people in their different classes and levels, age groups and geographic relations, understand our policy,'' he said.<P>

   Raul might have sounded like a typical political consultant for the U.S. Democratic or GOP presidential campaigns: Find the voters' concern, offer solutions, convince them you're honest and win their ballots.<P>

   But few things are ever so straightforward in Cuba.<P>

   ``It is either we who will motivate the people, or the enemy, the open and conniving enemy of the revolution,'' Raul added. He didn't have to identify the enemy -- the United States.<P>

   In Raul's worst-case scenario, the enemy could foment dissatisfaction among Cubans that sparks riots and other unrest, opening the way for a ``humanitarian'' intervention by U.S. troops.<P>

   Some U.S. analysts of Cuban affairs see Raul's speech as a ``stay alert'' caution to the revolutionary faithful as Cuba emerges, ever so slowly, from its economic crisis of the past five years.<P>

   But some Cubans inside the island see the speech differently: a significant confirmation that Cuba's rulers see themselves threatened by the capitalist virus brought in by foreigners.<P>
