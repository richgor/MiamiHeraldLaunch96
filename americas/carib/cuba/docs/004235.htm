   Cuban President Fidel Castro has told CBS News that before the shooting down of two exile planes Feb. 24, a representative of the U.S. government ``at the highest levels'' assured his government that illegal overflights of Cuba by exile planes would stop.<P>

   ``I could not imagine the idea that such a big country with those resources would not be able to prevent those people from repeating their actions,'' Castro told Dan Rather on Tuesday's CBS Evening News. <P>

   Castro did not say who gave the Cuban government its assurances. In an earlier interview with Time magazine shortly after the incident, Castro did not mention any such assurances.<P>

   No one was available at the State Department on Tuesday night to comment on Castro's statement.<P>

   Four fliers of the exile group Brothers to the Rescue were killed Feb. 24 when Cuban MiGs shot them down over the sea north of Cuba.<P>

   According to Cuba, more than one exile plane violated Cuban airspace that day. According to U.S. government radar, at least one Brothers plane crossed into that airspace. Brothers denies any violation that day.<P>

   The deaths led the United States to tighten its economic embargo on Cuba.<P>

   Castro told Rather he did not give a specific order that the planes be shot down that day and neither did his brother Raul, head of the Cuban armed forces. But Castro said he had given general orders that violations of Cuban airspace should be stopped and that exile pilots had been warned not to do it.<P>

   ``They pay attention to no one,'' Castro said, referring to Brothers pilots. ``You ask them to come down and they do not land. You ask them to go and they do not. So they feel they can do that with impunity.''<P>

   The MiG pilots, he said, ``acted on standing orders. They knew they were discharging their duties. They were doing what they had been ordered to do.''
