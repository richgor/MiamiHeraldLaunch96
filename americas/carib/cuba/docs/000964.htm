   WASHINGTON -- In the aftermath of the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion 35 years ago this month, President Kennedy brushed off an invitation from the revolutionary leader Che Guevara to reach terms for peaceful coexistence between the United States and Cuba, newly released documents show.<P>

   Kennedy -- weighing the political risks at home -- also put the brakes on talks with Cuban President Fidel Castro to pay ransom to free nearly 1,200 exile-invaders in Cuban jails, and gave the green light for a new program of subversion dubbed Operation Mongoose.<P>

   Hundreds of Eisenhower and Kennedy administration documents declassified last week cast light on U.S.-Cuban relations from the 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco to the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962.<P>

   While those two harrowing episodes have been amply documented, the new files provide firsthand accounts -- often intensely personal -- of the administration's anguished days between them.<P>

   Two days after the collapse of the Bay of Pigs expedition, Chester Bowles, the undersecretary of state, described a grim post-mortem at the White House. The president, whose entire career had been a string of successes, was devastated, Bowles wrote in notes on the April 20 Cabinet meeting.<P>

   ``The president was really quite shattered, and understandably so,'' Bowles reported. The supposedly covert CIA-led invasion had been crushed for want of U.S. air support and troops. `` . . . Here for the first time he faced a situation where his judgment had been mistaken.''<BR>
<P>

   While JFK mulled over events in ``acute shock'' and a ``dangerous mood,'' his Cabinet erupted in ruthless finger-pointing, Bowles said.<P>

   ``It was not a pleasant experience,'' he wrote. ``Reactions around the table were almost savage, as everyone appeared to be jumping on everyone else.''<P>

   The angriest response of all came from the president's brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy. <P>

   ``Slamming into anyone who suggested we go slowly,'' the attorney general demanded new specific proposals to harass Castro, Bowles said.<P>

   Four months later, as President Kennedy reviewed options that ranged from a full-scale U.S. invasion to a policy of containment, a top White House adviser had a remarkable encounter with Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, the Argentine-born insurgent who had become the second most powerful man in Cuba.<BR>
   Richard Goodwin, Kennedy's assistant special counsel, found himself at a cocktail party on Aug. 17 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, where Kennedy's antidote to Cuban-style revolutions, the Alliance for Progress, was taking shape, according to a memo Goodwin sent to the president.<P>

   At 2 a.m., two South American diplomats pressed Goodwin into the company of Guevara, apparently at Guevara's insistence, Goodwin wrote.<P>

   ``Che was wearing green fatigues and his usual overgrown and scraggly beard,'' Goodwin wrote. ``Behind the beard, his features are quite soft, almost feminine, and his manner is intense. He has a good sense of humor, and there was considerable joking back and forth during the meeting.''<P>

   With the Latin diplomats acting as translators, Goodwin quickly deduced that Guevara had a message to deliver to Kennedy and was free to negotiate on Cuba's behalf.<P>

   While claiming that the Cuban Revolution and its reforms were irreversible, Guevara told Goodwin the Castro government was prepared to forswear any political alliance with the Soviet bloc, pay for confiscated American properties in trade, and consider curbing Cuba's support for leftist insurgencies in other countries. In return, it was assumed, the United States would cease all hostile actions.<P>

   ``He . . . said they didn't want an understanding with the U.S. because they knew that was impossible,'' Goodwin reported. ``They would like a modus vivendi . . . . He thought we should put forth [a practical formula] because we had public opinion to worry about, whereas he could accept anything without worrying about public opinion.''<BR>
   Guevara's overture bombed. Goodwin urged Kennedy to wage all-out economic war. <P>

   ``Pay little public attention to Cuba,'' he advised, and ``quietly intensify'' economic pressure.<P>

   In November of 1961, Kennedy authorized Operation Mongoose, a sweeping secret plan that envisioned all manner of disruption short of an open U.S. intervention: Blowing up power stations, scuttling shipping, infiltrating U.S. intelligence agents into Cuba, funding anti-Castro radio stations, culling sensitive information from the thousands of exiles interrogated on arrival at Opa-locka Airport.<P>

   Robert Kennedy was tapped by the president to oversee Mongoose.<P>

   ``My idea is to stir things up on the island with espionage, sabotage, general disorder, run and operated by the Cubans themselves with every group but Batista-ites and Communists,'' the attorney general noted in a handwritten Nov. 7 memo.<P>

   ``Do not know if we will be successful in overthrowing Castro, but we have nothing to lose in my estimate.''<BR>
   Intelligence-gathering was critical for the plan. But despite Cuba's proximity, the CIA had only 27 or 28 agents on the island -- and it had lost contact with more than half of them -- by the end of 1961, noted CIA chief John McCone in a secret Dec. 27 memo. <P>

   The CIA had ``no penetration'' at the top of Castro's regime. The selection of the Bay of Pigs invasion site -- a swamp-surrounded inlet ill-suited for an amphibious landing -- had been based on surveys that were 66 years old, Robert Kennedy noted ruefully.<P>

   Under Mongoose, a $50 million industry with 477 full-time staffers sprang up almost overnight, documents show. With Miami as the operational center, the CIA had infiltrated nine intelligence teams into Cuba by mid-1962 and recruited a number of foreign diplomats and two or three Cuban defectors in Cuba.<P>

   But in Cuba, the impact of Mongoose was minimal, owing to logistical difficulties and strong Cuban counterintelligence. Ten months into the operation, Robert Hurwitch, a senior State Department aide, offered an almost comical assessment in a top secret memo:<P>

   ``Reports indicate that some, apparently very limited, nuisance sabotage (sugar in gas tanks, etc.) does occur. Our ability to persuade the Cuban people to engage in more widespread activities of this nature is handicapped by our limited ability to communicate and the difficulty in landing and distributing sabotage materiel, such as plastic explosives, incendiary fountain pens and similar devices.''<BR>
   The paper trail of efforts to assassinate Castro is scant: a State Department annotation says that the CIA ``twice . . . supplied lethal pills to U.S. gambling syndicate members working on behalf of CIA in a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro'' in early 1961 and early 1962. A third effort was launched in mid-1962.<P>

   A CIA memo refers to orders that ``discussion of the assassination of Cuban leaders should not be put in writing.''<P>

   With 1,179 exile-invaders in Cuban jails, Kennedy was under pressure to win their release. After Castro set ransom at $62 million in April 1962, Kennedy dispatched a New York lawyer, James Donovan, to negotiate better terms and promise food and medicine, rather than cash.<P>

   In early September, Donovan returned from Havana with a shopping list of pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs valued at $25 million, to be accompanied by $3 million in cash.<P>

   ``Word we have is that Fidel wants to complete all arrangements quickest, within 10 days,'' Donovan reported to the CIA.<P>

   But Kennedy, worried that the humiliating ransom might be used against Democrats in the 1962 congressional election, suggested the United States hold off for six weeks, the CIA's McCone noted on Sept. 25.<P>

   Democrats retained control of the House and Senate that year. But Castro's price tag went up: He received $53 million in food and drugs before the first of the prisoners reached Miami Dec. 23, after 20 months in captivity.<P>
