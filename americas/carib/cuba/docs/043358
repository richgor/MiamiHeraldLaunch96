<m0>   HAVANA (--) (AP) (--) In a flamboyant celebration of communism designed to defy the United States, Fidel Castro presided over a May Day parade Wednesday with hundreds of thousands of marchers waving Cuban flags and carrying anti-American banners.<ep>
   Cuba's first full-blown May Day celebration in three years also was meant to show renewed confidence and resources as the country recovers from a disastrous economic crisis caused by the collapse of its socialist allies in Europe.<ep>
   Patriotic music blasted from loudspeakers across the Plaza of the Revolution as Castro stood on a marble platform and peered through binoculars at the river of marchers. Above him was a 450-foot tower honoring Cuba's independence hero Jose Marti.<ep>
   For the past two years, only small neighborhood gatherings marked the traditional socialist and communist workers holiday, with officials saying there wasn't enough fuel or transportation for a big celebration.<ep>
   Cuban officials billed this year's march as a rejection of the Helms-Burton Act that tightens the U.S. embargo of Cuba, and as a reaffirmation of Cuba's communist principles.<ep>
   Pedro Ross, the head of the Cuban labor movement, opened the march with the traditional cry of ``Socialism or death! Fatherland or death! We will be victorious!''<ep>
   Among the guests in the reviewing area were two figures from the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 70s: Kwame Ture (--) the former Stokely Carmichael (--) and Assata Shakur, the former Joanne Chesimard.<ep>
   Shakur, a former member of the Black Liberation Army, was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper in 1973. She escaped from prison in 1979 and went to Cuba.<ep>
   Ture is in Cuba for cancer treatment.<ep>
   Organizers claimed nearly one million people took part in the three-hour parade. With ranks sometimes 50 to 60 across, the number of people was clearly in the hundreds of thousands.<ep>
   Signs (--) many of them printed (--) bore slogans such as ``Down with Helms-Burton'' and ``U.S.A.: Use Your Head!'' Some marchers danced to drummers beating out Afro-Caribbean rhythms in a cacophony of sound.<ep>
