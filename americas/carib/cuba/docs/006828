<m0>   Eighteen Cubans who had been detained for months at the U.S. Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were repatriated Wednesday, despite their pleas to be admitted to the United States.<ep>
   U.S. immigration officials ``determined that none [of the detainees] had a credible reason to fear persecution after returning'' to Cuba, said Daniel Kane, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington, D.C.<ep>
   One of the deportees was Milena Roblejo, 4, who arrived at the base in October 1995. Her mother, Geisi Rodriguez, swam across the bay from the Cuban side, pulling an inner-tube raft with Milena aboard. The girl's father, Reinaldo Roblejo, had arrived at the base a month earlier. All three family members were repatriated Wednesday.<ep>
   Most of the men repatriated Wednesday had fled into the base while serving prison terms for previous attempts to leave Cuba. Some escaped from a forced-labor camp. Others took advantage of weekend passes (--) occasionally given to prison inmates for home visits (--) to cross into American-held territory.<ep>
   In Washington, several legislators appealed unsuccessfully to the White House to halt the deportations.<ep>
   ``I am extremely disappointed,'' said Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``The right to emigrate is internationally recognized and now the United States is participating in the violation of human rights.''<ep>
   Early Wednesday, Navy security personnel surrounded Camp 11, where the Cubans were held, and notified them of the deportation order. At 1 p.m., several buses carried the deportees to the base's northeast gate, where they were turned over to Cuban border guards.<ep>
   The deportees, part of a group of 26 Cubans at the camp, arrived at the naval base after May 2, 1995, the day President Clinton announced the mandatory repatriation of any Cuban rafters intercepted at sea.<ep>
   The INS says the Cuban government has vowed not to take reprisals against any repatriated Cubans (--) not even against those who escaped from prison to slip into the U.S. base.<ep>
   But a State Department memorandum dated Monday (--) a copy of which was obtained by The Herald (--) indicates that, of 289 Cubans repatriated since May 2, 1995, three have been returned to the prisons from which they escaped.<ep>
   At least 13 of the Cubans deported Wednesday could be similarly reincarcerated.<ep>
   ``Indications are that all or most of them will experience the same fate,'' Torricelli said. ``They'll wind up in prison. It's a disgrace.''<ql>
