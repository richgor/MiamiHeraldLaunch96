   SAN JUAN -- Directors of the governing New Progress Party (PNP) have voted unanimously to suspend former Sen. Nicholas Nogueras, 60, who was expelled from the Senate last month because of ethics violations.<P>

   A resolution approved by the PNP directors cited Nogueras' expulsion from the Senate April 25, his indictment by a federal grand jury April 24 on U.S. tax evasion charges and an investigation by a local prosecutor on allegations of local tax violations.<P>

   The directors also ordered the party's Conciliation Committee to recommend whether to impose further sanctions, including expelling Nogueras from the party.

<LI> BARBADOS -- Barbados will host the 20th annual conference of the Caribbean Tourism Organization Sept. 26-28. The agenda is expected to include tourism and the environment; understanding and using technology in the industry; tourism in the next millennium; tourism research and development; and marketing the Caribbean overseas.<BR>
<LI> CARIBBEAN -- Caribbean Community (CARICOM) foreign ministers will open a two-day meeting in Jamaica today, focusing on subjects that include a follow-up to the 1994 Summit of the Americas in Miami and its commitment to a hemisphere free trade area.<BR>
<LI> DOMINICAN REPUBLIC -- The country's gross national product increased by 4.5 percent in the first three months of this year, the Central Bank reported. That compared to a 2.5 percent increase in the first quarter of 1995.<BR>
<LI> HAITI -- Stanley Schrager, the high-profile public affairs officer at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince for the past three years, has been nominated by President Clinton as the new U.S. Ambassador to the African Republic of Djibouti. He is leaving Haiti Saturday.<BR>
<LI> HAITI -- Weekly commercial air service has been inaugurated between Haiti and Cuba, with a charter flight leaving every Friday for Santiago de Cuba and returning on the following Sunday. Diplomatic relations between the two nations were resumed Feb. 6, as the last official act of outgoing Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.<BR>
<LI> JAMAICA -- A quadruple weekend killing in Kingston, which police attribute to gang warfare, has put Jamaica on a record-setting pace for murders in 1996. Police statistics show that 281 people have been murdered since the start of 1996. In all of 1995 the figure was 780, second only to the record high 889 murders in the violent national election year of 1980.<BR>
<LI> MONTSERRAT -- Scientists say there has been a gradual decrease in activity at the Soufriere Hills volcano, but continue to warn against visits to the evacuated part of the island. ``The parameters that we normally measure, in terms of the seismicity and deformation, continue to be relatively low, compared to what we had about a month ago,'' said Dr. William Ambeh, the chief scientist.<BR>
<LI> TRINIDAD -- A new weekly, The Independent, has joined three daily and six other weekly newspapers published in the country. Its editor is Sunity Maharaj, one of several journalists who resigned from the country's oldest daily, The Guardian, last month in a dispute with ownership over press freedom and government pressure.<BR>
<LI> TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS -- One of the fastest-growing tourism destinations in the region, this British dependency reported a 19 percent increase in visitor arrivals during the first three months of this year compared to the same period last year.
