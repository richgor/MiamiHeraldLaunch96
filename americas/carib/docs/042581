<m0>   The Barbados government says it will lend $1 million to employees of the cash-strapped Carib Express airline, which was forced to suspend its flights last week. The loan hinges on employee agreement to forgo their April and May salaries and pump 10 percent of their monthly earnings into the airline over the next 10 years, said Ronald Topping, Minister of International Transport.<ep>
   The Barbados-based carrier employs 120 people and needs $3 million to keep running until it can implement a new business plan.<ep>
   Paul Lewis, an airline executive, said the funds sought would keep Carib Express going until May 1, when a revised summer flight schedule that would theoretically help the carrier turn a profit takes effect.<ep>
   Carib Express, which offers flights to eight Caribbean nations, halted operations April 18. Its ownership includes private investors from the Eastern Caribbean with 70 percent, British Airways with 20 percent and the governments of Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent with 10 percent.<ql>
(box) Caribbean Community (CARICOM) economies grew at a slower rate in 1995 due to a slowdown in vital tourism and reduced output in some of the major territories, according to the 1995 annual report of the Central Bank of Barbados. Although growth was slower than in 1994, inflation rates within CARICOM remained modest, except for Jamaica.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>NASSAU <m0>(--) A new Environmental Health Court (--) the first in the region (--) has prosecuted 32 cases since it began operation Feb. 5, according to Dr. Donald Cooper, director of Environmental Health Services.<ep>
   He said that ``cases investigated include unsanitary conditions in restaurants and homes, overgrown lots, mosquito-breeding, defective septic tanks, littering (--) anything that negatively impacts on the environment.''<ep>
    Prosecution, Cooper told a press conference, is a ``last-resort measure,'' with his department ``seeking to have every breach of the law resolved by discussion.''<ql>
<m0>(box) NASSAU <m0>(--) Lynden Pindling, former prime minister and current leader of the opposition Progressive Liberal Party, is in Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Maryland for further tests on two tumors in his abdomen.

shut down hotels<ql>

<m0>   <m0>ST. GEORGE'S <m0>(--) Two of the island's largest hotels are threatened with shutdown due to a water shortage caused by a severe dry season. Management of the 212-room Rex Grenadian and the 186-room Grenada Renaissance say they may have to close if they cannot get a constant supply of water. <ep>
   The Grenada Renaissance already has stopped accepting reservations until after the dry season and is arranging to relocate its 80 guests.<ep>
   Managers at the Rex Grenadian says they may be forced to stop further bookings. ``We have 200 tourists staying with us at the moment and it's really unfortunate that they are having to be put through this inconvenience,'' Assistant Manager Ken Flockhart said.<ql>
