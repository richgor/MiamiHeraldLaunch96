<m0>   The Barbados government says it will lend $1 million to employees of the cash-strapped Carib Express airline, which was forced to suspend its flights last week. The loan hinges on employee agreement to forgo their April and May salaries and pump 10 percent of their monthly earnings into the airline over the next 10 years, said Ronald Topping, Minister of International Transport.<ep>
   The Barbados-based carrier employs 120 people and needs $3 million to keep running until it can implement a new business plan.<ep>
   Paul Lewis, an airline executive, said the funds sought would keep Carib Express going until May 1, when a revised summer flight schedule that would theoretically help the carrier turn a profit takes effect.<ep>
   Carib Express, which offers flights to eight Caribbean nations, halted operations April 18. <ql>

Although growth was slower than in 1994, inflation rates within CARICOM remained modest, except for Jamaica.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>NASSAU <m0>(--) A new Environmental Health Court (--) the first in the region (--) has prosecuted 32 cases since it began operation Feb. 5, according to Dr. Donald Cooper, director of Environmental Health Services.<ep>
   He said that ``cases investigated include unsanitary conditions in restaurants and homes, overgrown lots, mosquito-breeding, defective septic tanks, littering (--) anything that negatively impacts on the environment.''<ep>
    Prosecution, Cooper told a press conference, is a ``last-resort measure,'' with his department ``seeking to have every breach of the law resolved by discussion.''<ql>
