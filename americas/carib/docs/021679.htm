   PORT OF SPAIN -- A visit from Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella this week led to discussion of trade arrangements with South America's Mercosur economic alliance for Trinidad and Tobago as well as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Foreign Minister Ralph Maraj said Tuesday. <P>

    ``We did hold significant discussions which have implications not only for Trinidad and Tobago and Argentina at the bilateral level but even more significantly for CARICOM and Mercosur at the multilateral level,'' Maraj said after his meeting with Di Tella.<P>

    ``What we have decided to do is to pursue a trading arrangement whereby Trinidad and Tobago could become a partner in the Mercosur grouping,'' Maraj said.<P>

   Mercosur, made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, has emerged as the most dynamic integration process in Latin America. Bolivia and Chile are expected to join the group.<P>

   Maraj said direct air links between Trinidad and Tobago and Argentina are being investigated as a way to increase communication between the two countries.

   CHARLOTTE AMALIE -- The local government is negotiating a contract to ventilate an underground fire at St. Thomas' Bovoni landfill to reduce the danger it will cause an explosion.<P>

   Gov. Roy L. Schneider said Monday his administration takes the dump fire seriously and hopes to bring it under control soon.<P>

   The underground fire, which has burned for more than three years, is fed by methane deposits buried deep in the landfill. Installing vents will not put out the fire but will allow gas to escape, easing pressure and lessening the chance of an explosion.<P>

   The Army Corps of Engineers has estimated the project will cost up to $1.5 million.<P>

   The fire occasionally breaks through the landfill's surface, sending thick smoke into surrounding residential areas. Dozens of nearby residents have reported respiratory problems.

   GEORGE TOWN -- Swiss fugitive Barbara Krueger has been freed on $300,000 bail pending an extradition hearing for allegedly fleeing her country with millions of dollars after her husband declared bankruptcy.<P>

   Krueger, 39, had spent more than two months in jail in this British Caribbean territory because she did not pay bail originally set at $3 million.<P>

   She left Northward Prison on Monday night after a magistrate lowered the bail. She had to surrender her passport and the couple's 38-foot boat, and stay at her home in the luxury Cayman Kai neighborhood on Grand Cayman Island.
