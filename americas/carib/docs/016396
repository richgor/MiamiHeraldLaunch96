   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (--) Allegations of plots to murder a presidential candidate. Alarm over possible vote fraud by a sly caudillo. The school year closed four weeks early out of fear of campaign violence.<ep>
   In some ways, a typically nasty campaign is taking place for elections next Thursday in the Dominican Republic (--) along with Cuba, Haiti and Mexico the last Latin American nations to master the art of democratic balloting.<ep>
   But if all goes well, the presidential vote could mark a sea change for 7.5 million Dominicans (--) one million living in the United States (--) and jump start an economy stalled by fears of turmoil.<ep>
   President Joaquin Balaguer, 89, will step down. For the first time in decades the rightist Balaguer and his perennial leftist foe, Juan Bosch, will be absent from the national stage. Their rivalry dates to the times of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, who ruled with Balaguer's support (--) while Bosch fulminated from exile (--) until the dictator was assassinated in <m2><ql>

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC,  FROM  1A<ql>
<m0>1961. <ep>
   All three top candidates in Thursday's vote have solid democratic credentials, and all have the stated intention of terminating the corruption, poverty and illiteracy that have marked the country for decades.<ep>
<m1><styl>mugr<ql>
Balaguer<ue5><ql>
<m0>   ``Dominicans are about to begin their escape from the past,'' said Robert Pastor, an aide to former President Jimmy Carter who is monitoring the electoral process. ``This election is about a new Dominican Republic.''<ep>
   Such sunny forecasts do not reassure the front-runner, Jose Francisco Pen~a Gomez, 61, <m4>Balaguer<m2><ql>
<m0>beaten by Balaguer in a 1994 vote so crooked that Balaguer later had to agree to cut his four-year term in half and not seek re-election.<ep>
   Pen~a Gomez now campaigns like a man possessed, his massively chaotic caravan of vans and motorcycles zooming down country roads for whistle-stop speeches that live up to his fame as an orator to raise the dead.<ep>
   Balaguer is like a pitcher whose arm is gone, Pen~a Gomez told baseball-crazy Dominicans during one cross-roads stop Monday. ``He can throw curves or fast balls, low or inside, but we're going to hit him.''<ep>
<m0>White elites<ep>
<m0>   Pen~a Gomez and his Dominican Revolutionary Party have rock-hard support among the poor. But he has never been able to shed his youthful image as a leftist firebrand or the accusation that he is the son of Haitians (--) an orphan, he claims black Dominican parents (--) in a nation where the white elites revile their Haitian neighbors.<ep>
   Two of the polls released this week give Pen~a Gomez 41 and 46 percent, short of the 50 percent he needs to avoid a runoff, and predict a second-round victory by Leonel Fernandez of the Liberation Party, now in second place with about 37 in both polls.<ep>
   Fernandez, who attended public schools in New York City for 10 years, has put a pro-business spin on his once dogmatically leftist party and won strong support among the upper and middle classes. He is Dominican through and through, the 42-year-old lawyer said in an interview, but he has ``assimilated some of the good values from a country [the United States] so well developed in terms of democratic history.''<ep>
   Far back in third place with 15 and 18 percent is Vice President Jacinto Peynado, 55, a U.S.-educated economist from Balaguer's Reformist Party whose conservative followers would likely back Fernandez in a second round. <m1> <m0>Peynado has strongly criticized the Balaguer government's corruption, and the president began speaking out for his party's candidate only in the final weeks of the campaign.<ep>
<m0>Skeptics worried<ep>
<m0>   But skeptics smell a maneuver by the wily Balaguer to ensure a defeat for Pen~a Gomez (--) the president openly scorns Haitians.<ep>
   ``He'll do anything to deny us legally, and if it's close, he'll cheat,'' Pen~a Gomez said in an interview. In a runoff, he added, Balaguer might cut a deal to dump Peynado and throw his support behind Fernandez.<ep>
   Balaguer has been a foe of Fernandez's political mentor, Juan Bosch, now 86 and retired from public life, since a military coup led to a civil war in 1965 and a U.S. military intervention.<ep>
   In the intrigue-filled world of Dominican politics, Balaguer's support for Fernandez would not automatically make him a winner in the June 30 runoff. Hard-line leftists in Fernandez's Liberation Party might reject a deal with Balaguer and defect to Pen~a Gomez. Peynado, humiliated by Balaguer's tepid support in the first round, might refuse to support Fernandez.<ep>
   The country can ill afford such shenanigans: Underemployment hovers around 25 percent and illiteracy around 30 percent. The peso is overvalued and many industries are stalled, leaving the island dependent on tourism and $600 million in annual remittances from Dominicans abroad.<ep>
   Dozens of observers from Washington, the Organization of American States, the United Nations and Europe have trooped here to whisper an electoral mantra for Balaguer (--) ``free, fair and transparent.''<ep>
   Some warning flags have already gone up in recent weeks:<ep>
   (box) One man told a press conference that a Balaguer aide hired him to assassinate Pen~a Gomez. After spending a night in jail, he claimed Pen~a Gomez aides had paid him to make the charge.<ep>
   (box) Soldiers stepped up deportations of illegal Haitian migrants (--) reports range from 300 to 1,500 (--) in what Dominicans see as a Balaguer effort to highlight Pen~a Gomez's alleged Haitian blood.<ep>
   (box) Rumors have spread that Pen~a Gomez's opponents will challenge black voters on election day as Haitians, on the assumption that blacks tend to support him.<ep>
   Yet when the smoke of conspiracy clears, most Dominicans and foreign observers believe the winner will be the man favored by voters, probably in clean elections, possibly without the need of deals with Balaguer.<ep>
   ``From an era of political primitivism we will be moving into a new chapter of Dominican history,'' said radio political commentator Ramon Colombo. ``We will be modernizing the rules of the game.''<ep>
