<m0>   MEXICO CITY (--) Jubilant about a series of dramatic steps by Mexico to improve cooperation, President Clinton's Cabinet takes a spring break in Mexico starting Monday (--) traveling here for high-level talks aimed at further cementing ties.<ep>
   In recent weeks, Mexico has extradited its citizens to the United States for the first time and has begun to work more closely with the American military, long viewed with deep suspicion. U.S. officials said both measures could be critical in fighting drug trafficking.<ep>
   The Clinton administration also goes into the two-day meeting with warm praise for President Ernesto Zedillo's cautious anti-inflation policies.<ep>
   Led by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, two-thirds of Clinton's Cabinet is expected to fly to Mexico City for the annual binational meeting.<ep>
  The U.S. delegation arrives in the midst of controversies over immigration and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.<ep>
   Mexican officials are especially anxious to defuse public outrage over a string of incidents in California involving illegal immigrants (--) particularly the televised beating of two Mexicans by Riverside County sheriff's deputies.<ep>
   ``Our objective [in the meetings] would be a mechanism . . . through which we could count on increased protection for the human rights of undocumented workers,'' a senior Mexican official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.<ep>
 Also high on the agenda for the meetings are such hot-button issues as immigration, drug trafficking and the $50 billion loan package that the United States organized last year after Mexico's peso collapsed.<ep>
   Reflecting the dramatic increase in cooperation in recent years, the two nations are expected to sign accords in areas such as technology, health and the environment. And they hope to resolve a thorny dispute over North American Free Trade Agreement regulations that would allow Mexican and U.S. trucks access to border areas.<ep>
   The meeting comes as the Clinton administration is unusually upbeat about Mexico's commitment to fighting drug trafficking (--) a top U.S. concern. Up to three-fourths of U.S. cocaine is thought to arrive through Mexico.<ep>
   But in a sign of continuing sensitivity over the issue, Mexicans have protested recent charges by DEA officials in Washington and Mexico City that drug traffickers were using Mexican banks to launder money.<ep>
   While Mexican officials privately have acknowledged a money-laundering problem here, critics accused the DEA of meddling in Mexico's affairs.<ep>
