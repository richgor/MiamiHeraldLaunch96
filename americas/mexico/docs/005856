<m0>   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (--) (AP) (--) Eight alleged gang members have been charged with murder and conspiracy in connection with seven unsolved killings. <ep>
   The arrests came during investigation into the suspected serial killings of 17 young women since last year. <ep>
   Police found nine victims last year in the desert on the outskirts of Ciudad Juarez, along the U.S. border, and eight more were found in the past six weeks. Some were raped and strangled, and at least one was stabbed.<ep>
   Authorities said they have not determined whether all the deaths are related.<ep>
   Arturo Chavez, attorney general for the state of Chihuahua, said detectives found evidence linking at least seven killings to the defendants, believed to be members of a gang called The Rebels.<ep>
   The evidence includes bite marks on two of the victims and blood in cars belonging to the defendants, Chavez said.<ep>
   Police are trying to determine whether the defendants, ages 17 to 26, were involved in the other 10 killings.<ep>
   A judge handed up the indictment after interrogating the suspects. A ninth person was charged with conspiracy.<ep>
   Investigators have refused to indicate a motive for the slayings. But news reports have said police believe the defendants were paid to lure young women to Sharif Sharif, 49, who has been charged in one of the slayings and has been in jail in Juarez since October.<ep>
