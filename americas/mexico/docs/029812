<m0>   Rosaura Revueltas, the Mexican actress who starred in the politically inflammatory film <m0>Salt of the Earth,<m0> died Tuesday at her home in Cuernavaca, Mexico. She was 86.<ep>
   In <m0>Salt of the Earth<m0>  (1953), Revueltas played the starring role of Esperanza Quintero, the wife of a Mexican-American zinc worker who becomes involved in the struggle for workers' and women's rights during a violent strike in New Mexico.<ep>
   The film, made in cooperation with the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, was produced by Paul Jarrico and directed by Herbert Biberman, both of whom had been blacklisted.<ep>
   Biberman, a member of the Hollywood 10, had spent five months in prison after refusing to cooperate with the House Committee on Un-American Activities. He and Jarrico formed a film company to create work for other blacklisted workers in the industry. The role of the sheriff in <m0>Salt of the Earth,<m0> for example, was played by Will Geer, who had been blacklisted.<ep>
   Toward the end of filming, Revueltas was arrested by immigration officials and charged with entering the United States illegally. She was deported to Mexico and the filmmakers had to use a double for the remainder of the movie. Once in Mexico, she was banned from acting there and never acted again.<ep>
   Revueltas was born into an artistic family in Durango, Mexico. She studied acting and ballet in Mexico City and made her theatrical debut in <m0>La Desconocida de Arras<m0>  (1946).<ep>
   Her Mexican films included <m0>Islas Marias<m0>  and <m0>Muchachas de Uniforme<m0>  (Girls in Uniform), both made in 1950. In the United States, she played a minor role in the 1953 film <m0>Sombrero.<m0><ep>
   She is survived by a son, Arturo Bodenstedt.<m2><ep>
