<m0>   MEXICO CITY (--) Stung by incidents in California, the United States reached agreement with Mexico on Tuesday to minimize the possibility that undocumented immigrants will suffer mistreatment in police custody.<ep>
   The agreement calls for arresting officers to notify suspected undocumented foreigners of their rights, including the right to contact consular representatives.<ep>
   Known in diplomatic parlance as a ``memorandum of understanding,'' the agreement is also designed to allow consular officials to be present at all times during judicial proceedings concerning their citizens.<ep>
   Announcement of the agreement came at the end of two days of wide-ranging talks attended by high-level delegations from the two countries. The U.S. delegation, led by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, had nine Cabinet officers and scores of lower-ranking officials.<ep>
   Christopher hailed the agreement, saying it will protect the civil rights of Mexican and U.S. citizens.<ep>
   The accord was an outgrowth of the series of incidents over the past five weeks in California in which 10 Mexicans were killed after police pursuits and two others were beaten by California police.<ep>
   The incidents struck a raw nerve in Mexico and prompted demands for firm action by the government of President Ernesto Zedillo.<ep>
   Mexican Foreign Secretary Angel Gurria said Monday night that unless the current trend of migration problems is reversed, the two countries could be headed for a confrontation.<ep>
   Ten other agreements were signed on a variety of other issues during the two days of talks.<ep>
   Despite tensions over migration issues, Christopher said he was confident that U.S.-Mexican relations are gradually overcoming the mutual suspicions of the past.<ep>
   After the discussions, Christopher paid a visit to Zedillo and praised him for his role in creating ``the strongest, most equal partnership the United States and Mexico have ever enjoyed.''<ep>
   Tensions over migration problems have steadily worsened over the past two years. Mexicans continue to be indignant over the approval of a 1994 California referendum that denied most government benefits to undocumented immigrants. <ep>
   Another setback occurred last week when the Senate voted 97-3 for legislation to nearly double the size of the border patrol, stiffen penalties for document fraud and speed deportation of immigrants.<ep>
   While regretting the recent incidents in California, the U.S. delegation at this week's talks stressed that all were related to attempts by organized rings in Mexico to smuggle people into the United States.<ql>
