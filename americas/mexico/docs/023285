<m0>   MEXICO CITY (--) (AP) (--) Secretary of State Warren Christopher proclaimed U.S.-Mexican relations at a historic high point Monday and said Mexico's reform program has given the country a stronger economic foundation than ever before.<ep>
   Speaking before a high-level gathering of Mexican and American officials shortly after arrival here, Christopher said, ``The United States and Mexico have forged the closest partnership in our history (--) a partnership based on mutual respect and shared vital interests in prosperity, stability and the rule of <m4>Christopher<m2><ql>
<m0>law.''<ep>
   Christopher, accompanied by eight fellow Cabinet members, came to Mexico for two days of talks on issues that cover the gamut of cross-border relations, including trade, drug trafficking, legal affairs and the environment. The two countries hold such talks annually.<ep>
   In remarks prepared for a gathering at Mexico's Ministry for External Relations, Christopher cautiously addressed the issue of beatings of undocumented Mexican immigrants last month by police in California.<ep>
   The beatings have caused a storm of controversy in Mexico and prompted demands by Mexican authorities for investigations by international human rights organizations.<ep>
   While saying the Clinton administration was committed to the prevention of rights abuses, he also said it has a responsibility to the American people ``to enforce our laws and protect our borders.''<ep>
   U.S. officials accompanying Christopher said they were pleased by the progress Mexico has made since late 1994, when a sharp devaluation caused a profound economic crisis.<ep>
   Aided by a $20 billion assistance program, Mexico has been able to weather the storm and has restored economic growth.<ep>
   But there are deep divisions among American officials on how well Mexico is performing in combating narcotics trafficking.<ep>
   Drug enforcement officials insist that Mexico's performance has fallen short, noting that about 70 percent of all cocaine consumed in the United States passes through Mexico.<ep>
   Other officials insist that Mexico is demonstrating a far more cooperative attitude than ever before.<ep>
   They point to a ground-breaking visit recently to Mexico by Defense Secretary William Perry and to Mexico's willingness to commit special forces to take part in training exercises at Fort Bragg, N.C.<ep>
   Mexico has shown a capacity ``to break out of historical shibboleths,'' one senior official said, referring to Mexico's traditional resistance to almost any form of military cooperation between the two countries.<ql>
