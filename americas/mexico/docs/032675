<m0>   MEXICO CITY (--) A plane carrying a group of miners crashed while trying to land Friday in rugged mountains of northwestern Mexico, killing 16 people and seriously injuring three others, authorities said.<ep>
   The twin-turboprop De Haviland Twin Otter DHC-6 was flying from Durango, capital of Durango state, when it crashed at 9:30 a.m. (10:30 a.m. EDT) near a remote airstrip, said state government spokesman Manuel Perez.<ep>
   Perez said both the pilot and co-pilot were killed with 14 others. Three people suffered serious burns and other injuries in the crash in Santa Maria de Otaes, a small mining town about 570 miles northwest of Mexico City.<ep>
   Witnesses said the plane came to rest in a steep ravine about 100 feet from the runway.<ep>
   The plane was used by a company that mines silver and gold in the area, Perez said.<ep>
   Company workers were the first to respond at the scene, authorities said. Army and state police officers, some flown in from Durango, arrived afterward.<ep>
   Television broadcasts showed bloodied bodies, wrapped in black plastic and red-woolen blankets, being carried off a light plane that airlifted them from the crash site to Durango's airport.<ep>
   One man was in serious condition and two other men in critical condition at the San Jorge Clinic in Durango, said a spokeswoman at the medical center who asked to remain anonymous.<ep>
   Authorities had no immediate report on what caused the crash; the weather was clear at the time.<ep>
   Martha Lopez, a reporter for Televisa TV news, said the plane was on a twice-weekly scheduled flight into Durango state's western Sierra Madre mountain range.<ep>
   It is a rugged area backed by jagged ridges with such names as the ``Spine of the Devil,'' and a rich mining region producing silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc. It is just inland from Mexico's northwestern Pacific coast.<ep>
