<m0>   MEXICO CITY (--) Jaime Garcia Terres, a noted Mexican poet and essayist, died Monday of apparent heart illness, news reports said. He was 71.<ep>
   In a five-decade career, Garcia Terres served as ambassador to Greece, held important posts at the national Institute of Fine Arts and published works of poetry and literary criticism.<ep>
   ``He was a very fine poet, a very refined poet,'' said Mexican author Carlos Fuentes. ``Beyond that, he was a committed man, a man with a social conscience. He was committed to democratic change in Mexico.''<ep>
   The government news agency Notimex called Garcia Terres ``a dignitary of Spanish letters and a tireless cultural promoter.''<ep>
   Fuentes said Garcia Terres' greatest work was his collected poems, which dealt with landscape, the Mexican approach to nature and coming of age.<ep>
   Among other works, Garcia Terres authored <m0>Panorama of Literary Criticism in Mexico<m0>  (1941), <m0>On the Responsibility of the Writer<m0>  (1949), <m0>The Younger Brother<m0>  (1953), <m0>Night Mail<m0>  (1954) and <m0>The Dark Fountain<m0>  (1961).<ep>
   According to news reports, Garcia Terres had been hospitalized in Mexico City since Thursday with unspecified heart troubles. Notimex quoted his daughter, Ximena, as saying that he suffered from several illnesses.<ql>
