   MEXICO CITY -- (AP) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher opened a high-level meeting here Monday with a glowing account of U.S-Mexican relations. But his Mexican counterpart -- in an apparent reference to migration disputes -- warned that the two countries may be headed toward a confrontation.<P>

   The unusually candid comments of Mexican Foreign Secretary Jose Angel Gurria were in response to three recent incidents on California highways involving undocumented immigrants.<P>

   In two of them, police <BR>
pursuits led to the deaths of 10 migrants while in the third, two migrants were beaten by police officers, an episode captured on videotape and shown repeatedly on Mexican television.<P>

   With Christopher standing at his side, Gurria said through a translator that Mexico has a duty ``to protect the integrity and the human and labor rights of our citizens.'' He said their migratory status does not by any means ``alter their inalienable rights as human beings, nor denies their important contribution to the United States economy.''<P>

   At another point, Gurria expressed deep concern by the emergence of trends that he said ``could jeopardize our relations and lead us down the road of confrontation.''<P>

   Gurria and Christopher spoke at the start of the annual U.S.-Mexico Binational Commission, a high-level exchange that this year involves a combined total of 300 officials from the two countries. The opening session was held in the main meeting room of the Ministry for External Relations with the two delegations gathered around a horseshoe-shaped table.<P>

   The contrast between the two opening speeches was sharp. Christopher proclaimed U.S.-Mexican relations are at a historical high point and said Mexico's reform program has given the country a stronger economic foundation than ever before.<P>

   ``The United States and Mexico have forged the closest partnership in our history -- a partnership based on mutual respect and shared vital interests in prosperity, stability and the rule of law,'' he declared.<P>

   Christopher cautiously addressed the issue of the police beating of undocumented Mexican immigrants, which led to demands by Mexican authorities for investigations by international human rights organizations.<P>

   While saying the Clinton administration was committed to the prevention of rights abuses, he also said it has a responsibility to the American people ``to enforce our laws and protect our borders.''<P>

   Christopher, accompanied by eight fellow Cabinet members, came to Mexico for two days of talks on issues that cover the gamut of cross-border relations, including trade, drug trafficking, legal affairs and the environment.
