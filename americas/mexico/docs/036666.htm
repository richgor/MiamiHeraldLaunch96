New intrigue over<BR>
Mexican's millions<BR>

   MEXICO CITY -- A newly turned up letter from a Mexican telecommunications tycoon could substantiate his claim that millions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts held by Raul Salinas were part of a business deal.<P>

   But the document -- a copy of which was obtained by The Herald -- is focusing investigators' attention on the ties between one of Mexico's wealthiest men and the brother of Mexico's last president at a time when the two might have profited from each other.<P>

   The tycoon, Carlos Peralta, recently handed over the two-page letter to Mexican prosecutors investigating the source of more than $120 million in foreign accounts of former President Carlos Salinas' brother.<P>

   Earlier this year -- shortly after the discovery of Raul Salinas' accounts erupted into Mexico's worst financial-political scandal in a decade -- Peralta stated that he had given Raul Salinas $50 million for an investment fund they were setting up in Switzerland. His claim corroborated Raul Salinas' story, disputing U.S. and Mexican initial suspicions that the bulk of the funds seized in the foreign accounts was drug money.<P>

   Peralta's first statements were met with widespread skepticism, however, because he failed to show bank receipts or other documents to prove his assertion. Raul Salinas' lawyers told reporters at the time that the two men never put their business transactions on paper <BR>
because they were based on mutual trust.<P>

   While the new evidence may prove Peralta's claim and shift the investigation away from drug money laundering, it raises questions about why a Mexican billionaire made such huge money transfers to the brother of Mexico's former president.<P>

   Peralta's office referred press inquiries to his attorneys. An attorney for Peralta confirmed that the telecommunications magnate had handed over a letter to Mexican prosecutors, proving that he had ordered the transfer to Raul Salinas' accounts and that it was a legitimate business deal.<BR>
Cellular phone company<BR>
<P>

   Among other businesses, Peralta owns Iusacell, a cellular phone company with nearly 1,900 employees, which is a joint venture with Bell Atlantic.<P>

   Mexican and U.S. investigators are now looking into whether the $50 million transfer was in exchange for the Mexican government's decision to award a lucrative cellular telephone operating license to Iusacell in the early 1990s.<P>

    ``We are trying to establish whether the money was given to Raul Salinas for an investment or whether it was a kickback,'' one Mexican attorney general's office investigator said. Peralta's attorney denied Iusacell had done anything illegal to obtain the license.<P>

    Raul Salinas is in a Mexican jail awaiting trial on charges of masterminding the assassination of a leading ruling party politician. He also has been charged with illicit enrichment for failing to report millions of dollars' worth of real estate holdings and bank deposits he kept in Mexico. He has not been charged in connection with the funds he kept in Swiss, British and other European bank accounts.<BR>
Instructions for transfer<BR>
<P>

   The two-page letter provided by Peralta is dated April 21, 1994, and contains instructions from Peralta to Langness Investment Ltd., a Peralta-owned company with an address in the British tax haven of Isle of Man, to transfer nearly $50 million to four accounts in New York.<P>

   According to the letter, Peralta instructed Langness to transfer $24.7 million to accounts at Citibank's private banking department in New York. The remainder was sent to Chase Manhattan Bank and Bankers Trust Co.<P>

   The largest transfer, $20 million, was made to the attention of Citibank's private banking executive, Amy Elliott, who according to U.S. and Mexican investigators was the banker who managed Raul Salinas' accounts.<P>

   Peralta's attorney, who asked not to be identified, said all four accounts belonged to Raul Salinas. Asked how he knew that, he responded that the four numbered accounts had been given by Raul Salinas to Peralta so that the latter could transfer the funds to them.<P>

   Iusacell became Mexico's first provider of car telephone services in 1989. Two years later, with the advent of wireless cellular telephones, the company argued that its original license entitled it to operate the new technology. Its claim led to legal challenges by rival firms.<BR>
Lots of business<BR>
<P>

   After a fierce legal dispute, the Salinas government awarded Iusacell a big portion of Mexico City's cellular telephone market, while opening up the rest of the country for other bidders.<P>

  Seeking new capital to serve the booming cellular telephone market, Iusacell obtained a $520 million injection of capital from Bell Atlantic in November 1993 and a second one for a similar amount in August 1994.<P>

   An attorney for Peralta said the money transferred to Raul Salinas had no relation to Iusacell, because it came from a $50 million personal loan that Peralta had obtained earlier from Banco Mexicano. The loan was for Langness Investment, he said.<P>

  ``Langness manages Peralta's personal wealth and doesn't have anything to do with Iusacell,'' the attorney said. ``No money from Iusacell or Bell Atlantic was involved in the transfer to Raul Salinas.''<P>

  Bell Atlantic spokesman Eric Rabe said his company purchased Iusacell shares from Peralta in August 1994, long after Peralta had made the bank transfers to Raul Salinas. The previous Bell Atlantic purchase of Iusacell stock in 1993 involved newly issued stock that did not go directly to Peralta, he said. <P>

  Rabe said his company had ``nothing to do'' with the business deals between Peralta and Raul Salinas.<P>

  One industry executive close to Bell Atlantic said the U.S. firm has investigated the case and concluded that no Bell Atlantic money was used in the bank transfers to Raul Salinas' accounts.
