   Hailing our hemisphere as ``the least militarized region of the world,'' U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry told a security symposium in Miami on Friday that his predecessors had looked south ``and saw security problems. I look south and see security partners.''<ep>
   There is, Perry said, ``a new era of peaceful and democratic cooperation among and between all nations in our hemisphere'' where all countries ``save one [Cuba] have chosen democracy. . . . This is presenting the opportunity of the century . . . an opportunity to secure a future of peace, stability and security for all our nations.''<ep>
   Perry's remarks came at a closing luncheon of the third Latin America Strategy Symposium co-sponsored by the Panama-based U.S. Military's Southern Command and the National Defense University in Washington.<ep>
   It brought together more than 100 ranking security officials and specialists from the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean for a three-day discussion on the theme ``Adapting to a New Security Environment.''<ep>
   Much of the discussion focused on new roles for security forces and the threats facing them, including drug trafficking, transnational criminal gangs, peacekeeping efforts and the consolidation of democracy.<ep>
   As an example of the new spirit of cooperation among the hemisphere's security forces, Perry cited this week's ``productive'' visit to Washington by Gen. Enrique Cervantes, Mexico's defense minister.<ep>
    The visit was in return for one Perry made to Mexico in November. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``In just six months since that visit, the United States and Mexico have launched a new, mutually beneficial relationship between our two militaries. We are working together to solve common challenges such as disaster relief and narco-trafficking.''<ep>
   As another example, Perry cited Paraguay, where earlier this week ``the democratically elected president faced the threat of a military coup. Neighboring states, the United States and the Organization of American States swung into action to support the president. Democracy prevailed in Paraguay.<m1><ep>
<m0>   ``This shows how sovereign nations of the hemisphere are working together today, partners in peace, prosperity and democracy,'' Perry said.<ep>
