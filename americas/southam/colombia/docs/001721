<m0>   BOGOTA, Colombia (--) (AP) (--) Leftist rebels killed at least 16 people Sunday in one of the country's most violent regions.<ep>
   RCN radio reported police as saying the victims, including at least two children, were killed in two separate attacks.<ep>
   The massacre took place in Turbo, a fishing town on the Caribbean coast. The town is located in Uraba, a banana-growing area near the northern border with Panama, where several mass killings have occurred in the past year.<ep>
   Guerrillas, paramilitary groups and the army are vying for control in Uraba. Authorities on Sunday blamed the latest massacre on the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.<ep>
