<m0>   BOGOTA, Colombia (--) A ruling has taken some of the legal heat off President Ernesto Samper and three of his Cabinet ministers, all of whom are under criminal investigation for allegedly taking drug money during the 1994 election campaign or plotting a cover-up afterward.<ep>
   The ruling by the Council of State retroactively nullified spending limits of about $5 million for presidential campaigns.<m1><ep>
<m0>   Following the decision, Samper and the three ministers may no longer be charged with defrauding the state or falsifying documents for exceeding the spending limits, although an inquiry will proceed over the alleged flow of drug money into the campaign.<ep>
   The ruling late Thursday appeared to save Interior Minister Horacio Serpa, Foreign Minister Rodrigo Pardo and Communications Minister Juan Manuel Turbay from going to prison while the investigation proceeded. The three ministers (--) all of whom played key roles in Samper's campaign (--) are accused of helping him cover up alleged donations from the Cali cocaine cartel amounting to at least $6 million.<ql>
<m0>Drugs and politics<ep>
<m0>   Colombia, home of the world's largest criminal cocaine syndicate, is in political turmoil over charges that the political class is deeply contaminated by the drug lords. Samper's administration is at the center of the scandal, although dozens of legislators are also under investigation.<ep>
   In late January, Samper's former campaign chief, Fernando Botero, said the Colombian leader orchestrated the solicitation of millions of dollars in last-minute donations from the Cali Cartel, fearing he would lose the election without an infusion of cash. Previously, Botero had defended the president vigorously, even after being detained for his own role in the scandal.<ep>
   Samper has denied the allegations, and a debate in the House of Representatives is likely to begin by May 21 over whether Samper should be absolved or whether the Senate should launch impeachment proceedings.<ep>
   The Council of State decision came just a day after the National Electoral Council found that both major presidential campaigns had far exceeded the 1994 spending limits. The Electoral Council said the Samper campaign had overspent by 7.2 billion pesos ($9 million) and the campaign of Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana by 1.2 billion pesos ($1.5 million).<ql>
<m0>Interpretation of ruling<ep>
<m0>   Samper's lawyer, Luis Guillermo Nieto Roa, said Friday that the ruling quashes potential convictions related to falsifying campaign spending documents.<ep>
   ``No one can break a law that doesn't exist,'' he said.<ep>
   Prosecutor General Alfonso Valdivieso voiced deep frustration at the Council of State ruling, noting that other candidates had abided by the spending limits.<ep>
   He said the ruling ``favors those who consciously acted . . . to hide the flow of resources <m1> <m0>when they exceeded the limits.''<ep>
   Botero's lawyer, Fernando London~o, described the Council of State ruling as ``absolutely political and grotesque.'' <m2><ep>
