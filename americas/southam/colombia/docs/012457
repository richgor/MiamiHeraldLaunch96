   BOGOTA, Colombia (--) Former Defense Minister Fernando Botero may be under arrest in a political scandal (--) but he's not without creature comforts.<ep>
   Among the visitors to Botero's cell at a well-manicured military base recently were a yoga teacher, a psychologist, a tennis instructor, a cook and a physical therapist. Even a dog was brought to Botero to provide him with company.<ep>
   Notes from a logbook at the army's Cavalry School, where Botero has been under detention since his arrest Aug. 15, were read on the air Tuesday by the RCN radio network. The army had no comment on the report.<ep>
   The issue of what to do with politicians put under arrest, and what kind of privileges they should get in detention, is growing in Colombia.<ep>
   More than 100 legislators are reportedly under criminal investigation in a mushrooming scandal <m2><ql>

BOTERO,  FROM  1A<ql>
<m0>over drug money in politics. Three of President Ernesto Samper's Cabinet ministers may go to jail within days. So many political figures may end up arrested that authorities in early <m1> <m0>April considered renting a whole neighborhood in Bogota where they could put the implicated legislators under mass house arrest.<ep>
   Instead, authorities are reconditioning 40 houses near La Picota Prison south of Bogota that were originally designed for jail personnel.<ep>
   Under Colombian law, legislators, judges and Cabinet ministers are given special privileges when arrested (--) in part because they might be killed in normal prisons.<ep>
   Botero was Samper's 1994 campaign chief and is accused of helping Samper obtain at least $6 million in donations from the Cali cocaine cartel. For months after his arrest, Botero denied the charges. But in January, he jolted Colombia by saying Samper knew of and orchestrated the receiving of the drug money.<ep>
   Supporters say efforts to portray Botero's detention as cushy are politically motivated.<ep>
   When asked about Botero's detention, his lawyer, Fernando London~o, suggested to a reporter that he call Botero's beeper number and leave a message. Shortly afterward, Botero returned the call.<ep>
   ``I'm speaking from the cellular phone of my wife, who is here visiting me,'' he said.<ep>
   Botero, son of the acclaimed and wealthy Colombian sculptor and painter of the same name, said the special conditions at the Cavalry School in northern Bogota did not make his arrest easy.<ep>
   ``It's not a sweetheart deal. It's a legal right,'' he said. ``I live in a room that measures six meters by 3 1/2 meters [20 by 11 feet]. For the first month, I didn't even have hot water.''<ep>
<m1>Back therapy<ep>
<m0>   He said the physical therapist and yoga instructor visit him because he injured his back in September and is required to undergo daily therapy.<ep>
   ``I have a dog that lives in the room with me,'' he added. ``His name is Matisse, like the artist. He's a German shepherd.''<ep>
   As defense minister, Botero helped design military strategy against leftist guerrillas and drug lords, and he said he would not survive in a prison filled with convicted rebels and drug traffickers.<ep>
   ``If I were in a normal jail, they would kill me,'' he said.<ep>
   Botero said he has an Apple computer and printer in his room, on which he writes a weekly letter distributed to supporters. The one-page letter, titled ``From My Cell,'' has become a hot commodity in Bogota.<ep>
   A scooter-riding messenger delivers each issue (--) stamped <m0>URGENTE!!  <m0>in red letters (--) to journalists, diplomats and politicians around the capital. The letter's commentary is usually biting against Samper, with whom Botero once sustained a deep friendship.<ep>
   When Botero started the newsletter four issues ago, 500 copies were printed and delivered, he said. Now, requests have driven circulation up to 10,500. <ep>
<m1>Homey quarters<ep>
<m0>   Elsewhere in Bogota, former Sen. Maria Izquierdo is confined to a room at a police precinct, equipped with a refrigerator, computer and VCR. She has decorated the homey quarters with letters and posters from her daughters. Like Botero, Izquierdo is collaborating with prosecutors. Also like Botero, she alleges that many of the most corrupt politicians have gotten off free.<ep>
   Prosecutors charged Izquierdo in January with taking about $68,000 from the Cali Cartel. She confessed her guilt and quit the Senate.<ep>
   ``I'm the one who received the least, and I'm the worst off. I have no house. I have no money,'' she said.<ep>
   Prison conditions in Colombia came under special scrutiny following the negotiated surrender of Medellin Cartel chief Pablo Escobar in 1991. Escobar turned himself in on condition that a specially conditioned mountainside jail be constructed. Within the jail, Escobar roamed with his portable phone, sent faxes to news media in Medellin and watched videos on his television.<ep>
   Escobar escaped in July 1992, and authorities gunned him down in late 1993.<ep>
   ``It wouldn't be appropriate to detain [politicians] in this country's jails,'' said Rep. Pablo Victoria of the ruling Liberal Party. ``The jails of Colombia are totally depressing and in a lamentable state of overcrowding.''<m2><ep>
