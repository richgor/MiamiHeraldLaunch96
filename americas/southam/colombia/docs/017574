<m0>   BOGOTA, Colombia (--) (AP) (--) Orlando Vasquez, the government's chief investigator of public officials, was ordered arrested Thursday on charges that he took money from the Cali drug cartel.<ep>
   Vasquez is the latest high-ranking target in Colombia's unfolding drug corruption scandal, which threatens to unseat President Ernesto Samper.<ep>
   Vasquez's arrest was ordered by Prosecutor General Alfonso Valdivieso, who has been leading an investigation of drug cartel influence in government. A spokesman for Valdivieso said Vasquez's whereabouts were not known.<ep>
   The arrest order comes as another major blow to Samper, who is defending himself before a congressional panel against allegations that he won election in 1994 with millions of dollars in contributions from the Cali Cartel, the world's largest illicit drug organization.<ep>
    Samper has denied any knowledge of the drug money donations. His lawyer has said that campaign aides apparently solicited cartel money and then stole it.<ep>
   The 53-year-old Vasquez, who has been in charge of investigating administrative wrongdoing since August 1994, has also served as interior minister and ambassador to Chile.<ep>
   Prosecutors allege that a cartel front company gave tens of thousands of dollars to Vasquez's failed Senate re-election campaign in 1994. They also say the cartel paid the bill when Vasquez stayed at Cali's Intercontinental Hotel twice in 1993. He faces charges of illegal enrichment.<ep>
   The United States suspended Vasquez's visa last month because of allegations of ties to drug traffickers.<ep>
   Also Thursday, Rep. Francisco Canossa resigned from the panel looking into drug corruption in Samper's campaign, denouncing the investigation as a sham.<ep>
