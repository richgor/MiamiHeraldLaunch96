<m0>   SANTIAGO, Chile (--) Herman Schmidt, the leader of a secretive German colony once accused of being a torture center, has died of a heart attack. He was 81.<ep>
   Schmidt died Friday at a hospital near Dignity Colony, 200 miles south of Santiago.<ep>
   The colony was established in 1961 by German immigrants and quickly grew as a modern agricultural operation. It also operated a hospital and a school.<ep>
   Former members claimed that the colony was used as a torture and execution center for the secret police after the 1973 coup that brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power.<ep>
   They also claimed that many residents were held against their will.<ep>
   Colony leaders denied the accusations, calling them part of a Communist-inspired smear campaign.<ep>
   After civilian rule was restored in 1990, the government ordered the colony dissolved after a court indicted its leaders on charges of evading taxes.<ep>
   Authorities allowed some of the members, including Schmidt, to continue to live in the farm after Dignity Colony ceased to legally exist.<ep>
   Funeral plans were not announced.<ep>
