   CARACAS (--) When the last government suddenly boosted prices as part of a shock plan to stabilize the economy, the poor streamed down from bleak hillside slums to loot Venezuela's modern capital.<ep>
   That was seven years ago, yet traumatic memories are still fresh of the chaos in which soldiers killed 300 people and several thousand were wounded.<ep>
   The specter of another bloodbath has intimidated public officials and everyday people alike. But President Rafael Caldera felt compelled to introduce a new austerity plan April 15 to deal with shrinking economic output, soaring prices and growing unemployment.<ep>
   Caldera is crossing his fingers that Venezuelans will accept sacrifice today to achieve a better standard of living tomorrow.<ep>
   So far, the country has remained quiet, but everyone is watching warily for signs of simmering resentments over new price rises.<ep>
   ``The measures are being accepted with calm. Maybe you could say with resignation,'' said Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff. `` . . . There is a general realization that something had to be done.''<ql>
<m0>Preparations<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   One factor in the calm may be that Caldera prepared the country for the need to end price controls, cut subsidies for staples and other measures that are pushing up costs. That contrasts with President Carlos Andres Perez, who sprang his economic ``shock'' plan with no warning in 1989.<ep>
   Caldera, 80, did not publicly present a comprehensive economic plan during his 1993 campaign. That came back to haunt him.<ep>
   Shortly after he took office on Feb. 2, 1994, the private banking sector nearly collapsed. The government had to earmark $8 billion (--) two-thirds of the 1994 budget (--) to bail out the banks. The sudden influx of cash into the economy drove up prices 71 percent that year and undermined the value of the bolivar, Venezuela's currency.<ep>
   To curtail inflation and capital flight, Caldera imposed controls on foreign exchange, prices and bank interest rates. That helped for a while.<ep>
   But by early this year, the bolivar was overvalued, inflation was headed toward 100 percent and outpacing wage gains, and unemployment was 11 percent and rising. The economy was projected to contract for the third time in four years.<ep>
   ``There is no middle class anymore, just the rich and poor,'' said Madya Pozzo, a car saleswoman.<ql>
<m0>Subsidies cut<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Adding to the pinch are cuts in state subsidies, notably for gasoline. The price of gas soared nearly ninefold for some octanes to a maximum 55 cents a gallon. Low by world standards, it's a lot for poor Venezuelans who are used to getting fuel almost free in this oil-exporting nation.<ep>
   So far, subway and bus fares have not gone up. But they are scheduled to, and it was Perez's hike in bus tickets that touched off the 1989 riots.<ep>
   Venezuelans seem to trust Caldera, who also was president in 1969-74. Perez, impeached on corruption charges in 1993, was reviled as a crook and philanderer.<ep>
   Caldera, however, hasn't shied from displaying a firm hand. Routine strikes and demonstrations by students and unions draw heavy police presence and rarely get out of control.<ep>
