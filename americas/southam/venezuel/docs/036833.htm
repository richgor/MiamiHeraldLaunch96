   CARACAS, Venezuela -- For weeks now, Planning Minister and ex-guerrilla Teodoro Petkoff has been a one-man traveling show, trying to avert social turmoil by selling the virtues of Venezuela's tough new economic policies to labor leaders, students, business groups, foreign investors, the Catholic Church, even the military.<P>

   The charismatic Petkoff argues that Venezuela is finally on the way to being mended after two years of economic chaos. The only Latin American country that had set off recently on a different course from its neighbors -- imposing measures that echoed the heavily state-managed economies of two decades ago -- Venezuela is again embracing free markets and promising to live within its means.<P>

   Venezuela's economic conversion represents the resounding defeat of a quasi-populist experiment by President Rafael Caldera, an 80-year-old political institution whose lone-wolf status among Latin leaders has been closely watched in the region.<P>

   Caldera's now abandoned promise never to kneel before the International Monetary Fund -- a vow he made during his campaign two years ago -- periodically resonated in a region where almost all governments are hewing to the tight fiscal policies required by international lenders.<P>

   Widely viewed here more as a forced response to the economic crisis than a matter of conviction, Caldera's about-face has sent a powerful message to Latin American leaders, particularly labor leaders and others on the left who say the region has gone too far in reviving market forces and are trying to articulate an alternative.<P>

   Economists and analysts offer various explanations of why Caldera's experiment failed, but what is undisputed is how symbolic the abandonment of his version of populism has been.<P>

   Historically identified with state intervention and pro-labor causes -- he is credited with writing Venezuela's labor law -- Caldera has set in place a reformation requiring privatization and reduction of the inflated state payroll.<P>

   The architect of the program is Petkoff, the ``man of the hour,'' as one foreign observer called him, and a powerful symbol in his own right. A former leftist guerrilla who benefited from a general amnesty granted by Caldera when he was president in the late 1960s, Petkoff finds himself enthusiastically selling an economic package that is anathema to his former comrades, not only here but throughout Latin America.<BR>
Pragmatic response<BR>
<P>

   Petkoff says his is not a political conversion, but a pragmatic response to a Venezuela that was out of step with the world. The socialist ex-senator, asked how he explains his conversion, characteristically quoted Deng Xiaoping: ``I don't care what color the cat is as long as it catches mice.<P>

   ``For me, these measures, the ones we are taking, are common sense,'' Petkoff added.<P>

   Venezuela's two-year-old controls on foreign exchange and interest rates have been abandoned, clearing the way for a preliminary accord with the IMF for a $1.4 billion loan. Precipitated by a financial crisis in 1994 and designed to prevent the flight of capital, the currency controls soon produced a heavily overvalued currency as demand for dollars exceeded the supply.<P>

   The ensuing distortion in the financial markets, high inflation and a dramatic drop in confidence on the part of foreign and national investors sent the country into a tailspin. So, last December the bolivar was devalued from 170 to the dollar to 290. Under the current, freer exchange measures, it now is trading at about 470 to the dollar.<P>

   The changes make it easier for Venezuela to seek domestic and international financing and to impose stricter fiscal discipline. Although measures to create a safety net are part of the package negotiated with the IMF, the cost in the short term may be borne by the poor and the middle class -- the population Caldera set out to protect two years ago.<P>

   To cut the budget deficit, Venezuela has upped the sales tax and ushered in the biggest increase in gasoline prices ever -- almost 500 percent. The goal is to restore stability in a country that, despite its vast oil reserves, has seen the quality of life for the majority of its citizens plummet since the oil-boom years of the 1970s.<BR>
Economic experimentation<BR>
<P>

   Petkoff says the economic package is long-term. If so, it will end more than a decade of economic experimentation that, according to economists, has crippled what once was Latin America's most promising nation. Inflation was 57 percent last year, the highest in Latin America. Eight out of 10 Venezuelans live in poverty, and one out of every two workers is effectively outside the money economy.<P>

   When President Carlos Andres Perez tried to implement a similar shift to free markets in 1989, including a more modest hike in gasoline prices, riots left more than 300 dead and helped open the door for Caldera-style populism.<P>

   This time around, with the exception of some isolated disturbances, Venezuelans have accepted the economic changes with seeming equanimity.<P>

   Petkoff attributes this in part to the government's selling of Agenda Venezuela, as the plan is known, and to its honesty -- ``We did not try to make the pill golden,'' he said.<P>

   But others said Venezuelans have not reacted violently because most of them feel the country is in such a desperate situation that any change is better than none.
