   LIMA, Peru -- Days before the frozen remains of a 500-year-old Inca woman are scheduled to be shipped to the United States for study and exhibit, a group of Peruvian archaeologists and politicians has petitioned the government not to allow the mummy to leave Peru.<P>

   The archaeologists and politicians maintain that the mummy, one of the most important archaeological finds in decades, is too fragile to make the journey and should remain in Peru as a national treasure.<P>

   The government of President Alberto Fujimori has already granted permission for the mummy to travel Saturday to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where it is to undergo elaborate studies before going on display at the National Geographic Society in Washington.<P>

   It is to return to Peru in late June.<P>

   But growing opposition, particularly from some of Peru's most noted archaeologists, could persuade the government to change its mind at the last minute. Officials said they are studying the complaint.<P>

   At issue is whether the frozen mummy, discovered in October on an icy summit in the Peruvian Andes, can be moved to the United States without suffering damage.<P>

   X-rays have shown that the mummy's organs and tissue are intact and could provide scientists with insight into the health and nutrition of the Incas, who dominated the Andes and western coast of South America before the 16th-century conquest of the continent by the Spanish.<P>

   Critics of the plan to move the mummy to the United States said that no frozen mummy has ever been successfully transported such a long distance and that there is a great risk that it would suffer radiation and bacterial damage during the trip or while on display.<P>

   ``We are taking an unnecessary risk moving the mummy at this time because we just don't know enough about conserving these type of frozen remains,'' said Dr. Sonia Guillen, a Peruvian bioanthropologist who is an expert on mummies.<P>

   Furthermore, Dr. Guillen, who took part in the early research on the frozen Inca mummy but is no longer associated with the project, said that a public exhibition of the mummy in the United States would be offensive to Native Americans, who have opposed the display of indigenous human remains and religious artifacts.<P>

   Reflecting a growing trend in Latin America to protect national cultural and artistic assets, Mariana Pease, a Peruvian historian and conservationist, said: ``If this mummy were a person of another race or from another part of the world, they would not put it on display. Why can't they come here and examine it? I think it's a matter of disrespect, disrespect for Peru.''<P>

   Any delay would come as a major disappointment for the National Geographic Society. The society is underwriting the study, which could cost several hundred thousand dollars.<P>

   Dr. Johan Reinhard, an American archaeologist and mountaineer who discovered the frozen remains, said the concerns of the Peruvians are unfounded because the mummy will be transported in a specially designed case that will cushion the remains and keep them frozen at minus 30 degrees.<P>

   ``What really disturbs me is that these accusations are being made without anyone ever contacting me as to what precautions were being taken, as to what was to be done with the mummy, and as to how it was to be handled,'' Reinhard said.<P>

   Barbara Moffet, a spokeswoman for National Geographic, said that before arranging to bring the mummy to the United States, the society discussed its exhibition with archaeologists in Peru and the United States, Peruvians who live in the region where the mummy was discovered and Native American groups.<P>

   All responded favorably to the idea, Moffet said.
