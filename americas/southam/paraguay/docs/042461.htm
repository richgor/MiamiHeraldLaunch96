   ASUNCION, Paraguay -- Overnight, the shadow of another coup in Paraguay was swept away, but relief was tempered by outrage over the compromise the civilian government made to escape the threat.<P>

   Army commander Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo, who had refused a presidential order to resign and had taken refuge in army barracks, agreed to leave his post, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy announced late Tuesday night in a nationally televised address. But the general's condition for resigning was that he be named defense minister.<P>

   Opposition parties, university students and human rights groups sharply criticized the agreement and held demonstrations throughout Asuncion on Wednesday, saying the president had lost a prime opportunity to free Paraguay from decades of military control.<P>

   ``Can someone, anyone, please explain how in a democratic system, a general who directly disobeys the orders of the president and starts a coup is later rewarded with a Cabinet position as defense minister?'' asked Alicia Saenz, a 52-year-old teacher, who demonstrated in front of Congress. ``What kind of message does that send out?''<P>

   Western diplomats said that although Oviedo remains a threat to democracy in his new position as defense minister, Wasmosy deserves praise for negotiating an end to the coup attempt.<P>

   ``The coup attempt was real and would have resulted in bloodshed,'' one diplomat said. ``This is perhaps the first time that a coup was thwarted here in Paraguay, and that is a significant step toward maintaining democracy.''<P>

   There were widespread calls Wednesday for Wasmosy to resign, however. When he took office in 1993, he became Paraguay's first elected civilian president since 1954. Under a new constitution written in 1992, Paraguayans have enjoyed new political freedoms, but the military has continued to loom large through its association with Wasmosy's Colorado Party.<P>

   Oviedo will continue to wield considerable power in Paraguay. He has widespread support among the army's rank and file, is a close friend of his successor, Gen. Oscar Diaz Delmas, and as defense minister will oversee the country's military policy and budget.<P>

   Dr. Carlos Filizollas, chairman of the left-wing National Encounter Party, said the compromise was ``an affront to the Paraguayan people and democratic institutions'' and that Wasmosy had lost credibility.<P>

   Crucial to ending the crisis without bloodshed was the support Wasmosy received from neighboring countries and trading partners, which offered the president military help and sent diplomats to Asuncion on Tuesday. Foreign ministers from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay met with the Wasmosy administration during the crisis.<P>

   Such regional support is unusual in Latin America and underscores a growing commitment to democracy in a region that has been plagued by military dictatorships.<P>

   ``It's a sign of the new era that we are living in here in Latin America when you have former military dictatorships saying very loudly and publicly that we will not tolerate this type of behavior at home or in our backyards,'' said Esteban Caballero Carrizosa, a political scientist.<BR>
