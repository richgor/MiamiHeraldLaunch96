   BOGOTA, Colombia (--) When a coup threat erupts in the Americas, as it did this week in Paraguay, hemispheric leaders have a new tradition: They sprint into action to thwart an upset to democracy.<ep>
   As a defiant army general challenged President Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay, foreign ministers from the region converged on the scene and the chief of the Organization of American States even borrowed a plane to arrive at Wasmosy's side.<ep>
 ``He was there in a flash,'' said Harriett Babbitt, U.S. ambassador to the OAS in Washington, adding that collective action helped turn back the coup. ``It was pivotal.''<ep>
   By Friday, Wasmosy was back in control and the former army commander, Gen. Lino Oviedo, was out of a job.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Analysts from around South America said a hemispheric routine is now well-established to safeguard democracies. <ep>
   But they said the threat to Wasmosy was a reminder that armed forces that exercised power until recently have yet to be integrated into democracies that now reign everywhere in the Western Hemisphere except Cuba.<ep>
   ``The armed forces remain like islands inside our democracies,'' said Enrique Obando, a political scientist at the Catholic University in Lima, Peru. ``They maintain their own authoritarian ideologies within our democratic systems.''<ep>
   Any military challenge to democratic rule in Latin America leaves the rest of the region absorbed by every development.<ep>
   ``It's all over the papers here,'' said Jose Zalaquett, a Chilean law professor and former president of Amnesty International.<ql>
<m1>Not just in Paraguay<ep>
<m0>   Continuing friction between elected Latin leaders and their military chiefs is widespread. <ep>
   ``This isn't exclusive to Paraguay. Here in Argentina, just two weeks ago, Gen. Mario Candido Diaz made a speech in front of the president defending all that had happened against the subversives,'' said Horacio Mendez Carrera, a human rights lawyer.<ep>
   The defense of Argentina's Dirty War of the late 1970s and early 1980s (--) when the military and police killed at least 9,000 people suspected of being leftists or their supporters (--) ``left everyone stupefied,'' he said.<ep>
   Many analysts and politicians lauded the unified action that defended Paraguay's democracy, established after Gen. Alfredo Stroessner fled the country in 1989, ending 35 years in power. Others said they found it chilling that military uprisings still occur.<ep>
   ``This is very dangerous in Latin America,'' Carlos Andres Perez, the former president of Venezuela, said in a telephone interview. ``The attitude of Wasmosy has been weak.''<ep>
   Wasmosy first tried to fire Oviedo for meddling in politics. Faced with the general's refusal to hand over his command, Wasmosy sought safe haven at the U.S. Embassy Monday night, but later offered Oviedo a Cabinet post as defense minister in order to get him to step down as army chief. Protesters outraged at the compromise threw rocks at the presidential palace.<ep>
   By the end of the week, and bolstered by international backing, Wasmosy rescinded his offer, leaving the former commander with no post at all.<ep>
  <ql>
<m1>Anti-coup mechanism<ep>
<m0>   OAS procedures to defend democracy are contained in the Santiago Resolution signed in the Chilean capital in 1991. The mechanism obligates member nations to act to overturn any possible coup.<ep>
   ``In the past in this hemisphere, there have always been governments that looked the other way,'' said Babbitt, the U.S. delegate to the OAS.<ep>
   Since 1991, the OAS has invoked the Santiago Resolution to fight the 1991 military overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti, the 1992 closure of Peru's Congress by President Alberto Fujimori and the 1993 attempt by President Jorge Serrano of Guatemala to impose near-dictatorial rule.<ep>
   With the threat to Paraguay's democracy clear, OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria borrowed a plane from Bolivia's president to head to Paraguay, and foreign ministers from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay also converged on the nation.<ep>
   The OAS Permanent Council issued a resolution in support of Wasmosy on Tuesday, making it clear to Oviedo that harsher steps would ensue if Paraguayan democracy was disrupted, Babbitt said.<ep>
   The concerted action paid off.<ep>
   ``It is a good message to the armed forces of Latin America that these kinds of [military] adventures do not bring results,'' Obando said.<ep>
