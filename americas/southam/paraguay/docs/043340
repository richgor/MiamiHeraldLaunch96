   ASUNCION, Paraguay (--) Rebellious Gen. Lino Oviedo relinquished command of the army Wednesday, bringing to an apparent end a standoff that had threatened Paraguay's fledgling democracy.<ep>
   The diminutive and often flamboyant general gave up his command to Gen. Oscar Diaz Delmas in a 20-minute ceremony at the First Corps Army barracks that was attended by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and about 500 military and civilian officials.<ep>
   Oviedo, now scheduled to retire from the army and be sworn in as defense minister, gave a brief speech and then embraced Wasmosy.<ep>
   It was only two days earlier that Wasmosy had fired Oviedo and barred him from public office for 10 years for insubordination. But in a sudden about-face Tuesday, the president said the general would hand over command and then be promoted to defense minister.<ep>
   The agreement appeared to defuse a 27-hour confrontation that many Paraguayans had feared would end in a military coup.<ep>
   Wasmosy, Paraguay's first democratically elected leader in nearly 50 years, first asked Oviedo to resign, accusing him of violating a constitutional ban on military participation in politics.<ep>
   But the general, who hopes to be a candidate to succeed Wasmosy in 1998, refused and holed up at the First Corps barracks, causing the president to fire him and name Delmas as his replacement.<m2><ql>

<m0>`A peaceful solution'<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Wasmosy described his decision to appoint Oviedo defense minister as ``the fruit of a peaceful solution.'' He added that the agreement had avoided bloodshed.<ep>
   It was Oviedo, waving a pistol in one hand and a grenade in the other, who stormed the bunker of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner in a 1989 uprising that ended 35 years of one-man rule. <ep>
   Paraguay, a nation of 5.3 million people, has been ruled by the military most of the time since it gained independence from Spain in 1811.<ep>
   Having now shown his strength in two major crises, Oviedo is expected to be a leading candidate in the 1998 election.<ep>
   The agreement with Wasmosy calls for Oviedo to replace Hugo Estigarribia, the first civilian to hold the post of defense minister since the 1940s.<ep>
   Under Estigarribia, the defense minister's job was mostly administrative, with commanders of the army, navy and air force reporting directly to the president, who is commander in chief. It was not known if the job duties would be the same under Oviedo.<ql>
<m1>U.S. signals support<m1><ep>
<m2><ql>
<m0>   The American Embassy issued a statement Tuesday saying ``the U.S. government applauds President Wasmosy for his courageous action to maintain constitutional and democratic rule.''<ep>
   ``We understand that Gen. Oviedo will leave military service,'' the statement said. ``Throughout this crisis the commitment of the Paraguayan people to democracy was made abundantly clear.''<ep>
 The country's navy, air force and national police also issued communiques in support of the embattled president.<ep>
   Politicians expressed amazement at the agreement.<ep>
   ``The world must be laughing at us because we are behaving like clowns conducting an orchestra,'' said Luis Maria Argan~a, a Colorado Party leader.<ql>
