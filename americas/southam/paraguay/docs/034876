<m0>   ASUNCION, Paraguay (--) (AP) (--) Bowing to public and political pressure, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy said Thursday he would not name a rebellious general to the post of defense minister.<ep>
   Wasmosy said he had ``decided to listen to the voice'' of the people and would find someone other than Gen. Lino <m4>Wasmosy<m2><ql>
<m0>Oviedo to fill the job.<ep>
   There was no immediate reaction from the general, who retired Tuesday in preparation for the Cabinet appointment. Oviedo was offered the post in exchange for a promise to step down as army commander.<ep>
   Wasmosy was forced into the face-saving deal when Oviedo refused his orders Monday to resign. The president accused the general of violating a constitutional ban on military participation in politics.<ep>
   The general, who hopes to succeed Wasmosy in 1998, holed up at an army barracks, beginning a 27-hour standoff that sparked fears of a coup and an end to Paraguay's 9-year-old democracy.<ep>
   While the job deal defused that standoff, it provoked a wave of public and political protest. Thousands of students staged street demonstrations and opposition political groups called for Wasmosy's impeachment.<ep>
   ``The conflict has been completely overcome,'' Wasmosy said Thursday in a brief speech from the presidential palace. ``Let's go back to work for the greatness of the country.''<ep>
