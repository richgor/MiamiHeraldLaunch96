<m0>   ASUNCION, Paraguay (--) (AP) (--) President Juan Carlos Wasmosy bowed to public and political pressure Thursday and said he would not name a rebellious army general as defense minister.<ep>
   ``The president is obliged to perma<m4>Wasmosy<m2><ql>
<m0>nently listen to the voice of the people, who gave him his mandate,'' Wasmosy said in a brief speech from his presidential palace office.<ep>
   ``Heeding that voice, I have decided to sacrifice my personal pledges . . . and will not name Gen. Lino Oviedo as minister of defense,'' the president said.<ep>
   Oviedo was fired Monday after refusing a presidential order to resign as army commander, but later agreed to step down in exchange for being named defense minister. But he told his supporters Thursday he had never asked to be named defense minister. <ep>
   A standoff between the two men had sparked fear that a military coup would end Paraguay's 9-year-old democracy and lead to the country's international isolation.<ep>
   Wasmosy's decision to name Oviedo to the Cabinet provoked public and political protests. Thousands of students staged street demonstrations, and opposition political groups called for Wasmosy's impeachment.<ep>
   A crowd of 3,000 who had gathered outside the palace to protest Oviedo's appointment broke into cheers and waved the country's red-white-and-blue flag as they heard of Wasmosy's decision.<ep>
   A nearby group of Oviedo supporters began throwing rocks and firecrackers at the crowd and the palace. Radio stations said at least two people were injured when they were struck in the head by rocks.<ep>
