<m0>   RIO DE JANEIRO (--) (AP) (--) A Rio state trooper who stunned a courtroom by coolly describing how he executed a street urchin was convicted Tuesday of murdering six children and sentenced to 309 years in prison.<ep>
   ``I fired, and I fired again,'' Marcos Vinicius Emmanuel said Monday at the start of his trial, seen as a test of Brazil's commitment to defend human rights.<ep>
   The slain boy was one of eight street children shot to death the night of July 23, 1993. Six were sleeping on the sidewalk near Candelaria Cathedral in downtown Rio.<ep>
   The jury of four men and three women took three hours Tuesday to find Emmanuel guilty on six counts of homicide, five counts of attempted homicide, one count of assault and two of assault followed by death.<ep>
   The severity of the sentence was considered a victory for human rights activists, who made the trial a virtual referendum on Brazil's commitment to defending human rights.<ep>
    Elizabeth Sutton of Amnesty International said the decision ``represents a small wedge in the wall of impunity'' enjoyed by police in Brazil.<ep>
   Judge Jose Geraldo Antonio cited the ``cruel form'' of the killings and the ``defenseless victims'' as reasons for the severity of the sentence.<ep>
   Defense lawyer Sandra Bossio said her client would appeal some charges and seek a retrial, which she said is routinely granted for sentences of over 20 years.<ep>
   The 309-year sentence was largely symbolic, as under Brazilian law the maximum prison term is 30 years. However, the long sentence means Emmanuel won't be eligible for parole before 30 years. He was to return to the state police barracks to await a retrial.<ep>
   Emmanuel is the first of eight suspects indicted in the killings. Three are to be tried May 27 and the other four are expected to go to trial later.<ep>
   The crimes had divided Brazilians, fed up with rising urban crime. Many openly favor the shopkeepers who routinely pay police officers to kill street children suspected of stealing. An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 children live on Rio's streets.<ep>
   Protesters holding white carnations and chanting ``Justice!'' gathered outside the five-story concrete courthouse in downtown Rio as the trial began Monday.<ep>
   Emmanuel, who for three years had denied taking part in the killings, said he decided to confess because ``it was weighing on my conscience.''<ep>
