   <m0>RIO DE JANEIRO (--) (AP) (--) In a nation numbed by violence and fed up with urban crime, the trial of the accused killers of eight street kids is seen as a test of Brazil's commitment to human rights.<ep>
   Coming just two weeks after the killing of some 19 landless peasants by police in the eastern Amazon, the trial, which starts today, has galvanized human rights groups across Brazil and abroad.<ep>
   ``There's a lot of symbolism in this case,'' said James Cavallaro, the director of Human Rights Watch/Brazil. ``The credibility of the criminal justice system in Brazil is at stake.''<ep>
   Three Rio de Janeiro state policemen and a metal worker are accused of the 1993 slayings. Four other state troopers are in custody and could face trial later.<ep>
   Significantly, the four will be tried by a civilian court instead of military tribunals. That's because the crimes were committed when the troopers were off duty, and the guns used were not police issue.<ep>
   ``This is as good as it gets,'' Cavallaro said. ``If no one is convicted, if this results in impunity, it will send a terrible message throughout Brazil.''<ep>
   The savagery of the killings shocked Brazilians.<ep>
   Before dawn on July 23, 1993, one or two cars drove up to the Candelaria Cathedral in downtown Rio, where dozens of street kids slept on newspapers spread on the sidewalk.<ep>
   Gunmen jumped out and opened fire, killing six youngsters. Two more were taken to the waterfront and executed. A young man, shot in the head and presumed dead, miraculously survived.<ep>
<m1>Key witness<ep>
<m0>   The survivor, Wagner dos Santos, is the key witness for the prosecution. After repeated threats and attempts against his life, dos Santos was flown to Switzerland last year to await the trial.<ep>
   Dos Santos returned to Brazil on Saturday and was staying at Federal Police headquarters in Rio. He was reportedly wearing a bulletproof vest.<ep>
   The first to be tried will be state trooper Marcos Vinicius Emmanuel. The court has not decided whether to try separately the other defendants (--) trooper Claudio Luiz Andrade dos Santos, Lt. Marcelo Cortes and Jurandir Gomes de Franca.<ep>
   But the case is anything but open-and-shut. This month, police came up with four more suspects, all active or former state policemen. The four are in custody but will not be tried now.<ep>
<m1>A confession<ep>
<m0>   One of the newly accused ex-troopers, Nelson Cunha, confessed Wednesday to the shooting and pointed to three others. Among them was Emmanuel (--) but not Cortes, Santos or Franca.<ep>
   Cunha, who claims to be a born-again Christian, produced what he said was one of the murder weapons: a .38-caliber revolver, hidden in the wall of his mother's house. Police were running ballistics tests to determine if he was telling the truth.<ep>
   Yvonne Bezerra de Mello, a prosecution witness who works with Rio street children, called the story a smoke screen.<ep>
   ``He's hiding someone,'' she said. ``The kids say there were two cars and eight or nine shooters.''<ep>
   Since the Candelaria killings, little has changed for the estimated 2,000 to 3,000 children who live on Rio's streets. Many beg or steal to survive, sniff glue to forget their hunger, and run in terror from police hired by shopkeepers to provide added security in high-crime districts.<ep>
   According to police figures, 596 minors were murdered last year in Rio de Janeiro state, up from 513 in 1994. Human rights activists say that doesn't include many children who are killed and buried in clandestine cemeteries.<ep>
