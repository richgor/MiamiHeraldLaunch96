<m0>   <m0>MEXICO CITY <m0>(--) An explosion ripped apart a factory in the Mexican capital Tuesday, blowing tons of glass and concrete for blocks, and tearing away nearby roofs. The blast killed at least two people and injured dozens.<ep>
   Red Cross workers, firefighters and trained dogs searched for more victims among the ruins of the Puente soap and oil factory. Plant workers had no warning of the blast, one stunned survivor said.<ep>
    ``I saw nothing and I heard nothing,'' said Jose Clemente Alanis, a worker at the factory. ``Everything shook violently and I don't want to remember more.''<ep>
   The Red Cross said at least 34 people were treated for injuries. There was no immediate word on the cause of the blast. <ql>

deal on Haiti aid <ql>
<m1><ue5>    <m0>After five months of deadlock, the Clinton administration and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., have negotiated an agreement that will lead to the release of almost $10 million in humanitarian aid to Haiti.<ep>
   As part of the deal, the U.S. Agency for International Development withdrew funding requests for five health and education programs and restructured them so that most of the money will be channeled through private groups or the United Nations, not the Haitian government.<ep>
   Helms, a longtime critic of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and of the Clinton administration's policy in Haiti, agreed in turn to release the money, according to congressional staff members and AID officials.<ql>
