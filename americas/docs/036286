<m0>   In an effort to bring the freshest news to readers in South America, The Herald begins printing its International Satellite Edition today in Bogota, Colombia.<ep>
   Subscribers to The Herald in Colombia will now enjoy the same fresh news over breakfast that readers in Miami get.<ep>
   ``For 50 years, The Herald's International Edition has been the most widely read English-language newspaper in Latin America,'' Herald Publisher David Lawrence said. ``Now, with remote satellite printing, we will be able to get a more up-to-date newspaper to our readers faster and at a lower cost to them than ever before.''<ep>
   In January, The Herald began printing its International Satellite Edition in Panama in partnership with La Prensa, the country's most respected daily. Perhaps as early as next month, The Herald will also begin publishing in Quito, Ecuador, and Cancun, Mexico, in partnership with newspapers in those cities.<ep>
   In Colombia, El Tiempo, the nation's most influential newspaper, will handle the printing and delivery of The Herald. For decades, The Herald printed copies of its International Edition in Miami and shipped them via airplane to Latin America, a process that sometimes took 24 hours before delivery.<ep>
   With satellite technology, readers will get a truly fresh newspaper. Editors can transmit the last pages of the newspaper as late as 2 a.m. to the El Tiempo printing presses in Bogota, ensuring that late-breaking news will arrive in Colombia in the next morning's paper.<ql>
