<m0>   <m0>LIMA <m0>(--) Peruvian archaeologists pressed the government Wednesday to block plans to send a 500-year-old frozen mummy of an Inca girl to the United States, saying the fragile remains could be damaged.<ep>
   The mummy, known as the ``Ice Princess,'' was discovered on a mountain peak in southern Peru in October. <ep>
   The Catholic University of Santa Maria in Arequipa, which has control of the mummy, plans to ship it to the United States on Saturday for study by scientists at John Hopkins University in Baltimore and display by the National Geographic Society in Washington.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>PARAMARIBO <m0>(--) The Organization of American States will help Suriname prepare for the May 23 election and monitor the balloting, under agreements signed Wednesday.<ep>
   The OAS will send 25 observers from 13 of its 38 member states, under a pact signed by OAS coordinator Edgardo Reis and Foreign Affairs Minister Subhas Mungra. Some of the monitors will remain until the new president has been inaugurated.<ep>
   The government of President Ronald Venetiaan invited the OAS to monitor the election after opposition parties called for international observers to guarantee that the balloting is carried out democratically.<ql>

Susana Agnelli, chairman of the European Council, received a letter from Manuel Marin of Spain, vice president of the European Commission, that repeated his statements Tuesday that Cuba had not pledged to improve the human rights situation on the island, a precondition to the negotiations.<ql>
