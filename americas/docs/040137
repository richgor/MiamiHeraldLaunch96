<m0>   <m0>SANTIAGO<m0> (--) Nearly 7,000 workers struck the world's largest copper mine Thursday, idling production and raising the possibility of higher international copper prices.<ep>
   Only supervisors, a small group that opposed the stoppage and 300 workers assigned to emergency services showed up for the 5 a.m. shift at the Chuquicamata mine, 1,000 miles north of Santiago, which is owned and operated by Codelco, the state copper company. <ep>
   The workers want a 4 percent wage hike and a $4,700 bonus. Base pay is $445 to $888 a month, but with bonuses they receive substantially higher salaries for the grueling work. <ql>
