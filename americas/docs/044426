<m0>   <m0>MEXICO CITY <m0>(--) An explosion ripped apart a factory in the Mexican capital Tuesday, blowing tons of glass and concrete for blocks, and tearing away nearby roofs. The blast killed at least two people and injured dozens.<ep>
   Red Cross workers, firefighters and trained dogs searched for more victims among the ruins of the Puente soap and oil factory. Plant workers had no warning of the blast, one stunned survivor said.<ep>
    ``I saw nothing and I heard nothing,'' said Jose Clemente Alanis, a worker at the factory. ``Everything shook violently and I don't want to remember more.''<ep>
   The Red Cross said at least 34 people were treated for injuries. There was no immediate word on the cause of the blast. <ql>
