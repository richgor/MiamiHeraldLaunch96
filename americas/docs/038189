<m0>   <m0>SANTIAGO<m0> (--) Nearly 7,000 workers struck the world's largest copper mine Thursday, idling production and raising the possibility of higher international copper prices.<ep>
   Workers are seeking a 4 percent wage hike and a $4,700 bonus at the state-owned Chuquicamata mine, 1,000 miles north of Santiago. <ql>

<m0>   Thousands of copies of El Nuevo Herald, The Herald's Spanish-language supplement, have been impounded in Havana by the Cuban government, said a U.S. government source who asked not to be identified.<ep>
   For several years, El Nuevo Herald has sent 250 copies a day to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana for free distribution to Cuban citizens who request them. The copies are sent at U.S. government expense on cargo planes that deliver humanitarian goods and gifts to the island. Cuban customs agents stopped releasing the newspapers several months ago and they have been accumulating in an airport warehouse, the source said.<ep>
   Alberto Ibarguen, El Nuevo Herald's publisher, said Thursday that he has agreed to a request from U.S. officials to suspend shipment of the newspaper until the situation is clarified. <ql>
