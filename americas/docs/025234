<m0>   <m0>SAN JUAN <m0>(--) The FBI said it arrested a local ruling party senator Wednesday after a federal grand jury handed down an indictment against him.<ep>
   The charges against Sen. Nicolas Nogueras of the New Progressive Party were not immediately available.<ep>
   `We just arrested him,'' FBI spokeswoman Sara Lema said after local television showed agents ushering Nogueras from his house in the Condado area of San Juan. The island Senate's Ethics Committee recommended in a report Friday that Nogueras be expelled for allegedly violating the local tax code, government ethics law and a law that limits a legislator's outside income.<ql>

<m0>   The United States plans to send several dozen Huey transport helicopters to Mexico in a few months as part of an effort to help the Mexican military combat the illegal drug trade.<ep>
   Jan Lodal, principal deputy U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, said in Washington Wednesday that agreement has been reached on the method of supplying the helicopters, which are Army surplus. The exact numbers and timing are yet to be worked out, he said.<ep>
   The eventual total will be in the range of a ``few dozen,'' he said. They will be given free of charge.<ql>
