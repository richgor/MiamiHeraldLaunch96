<ue5>U.S.: Nun's kidnapping<ql>
story considered `hoax'<ql>
<ue5><ep>
  U.S. Embassy officials in Guatemala considered an American nun's account of being kidnapped, raped and tortured by military personnel in 1989 as a ``hoax,'' but investigated anyway for fear of bad publicity, according to State Department documents released Monday in Washington.<ep>
   Despite a lack of firm evidence, the U.S. government has ``no reason not to believe'' Sister Dianna Ortiz, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.<ep>
   The documents were among 20,000 released by the State Department on the suspected murders and tortures of 18 Americans dating to 1984.<ep>
