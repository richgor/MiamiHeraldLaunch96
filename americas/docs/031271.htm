   LATIN AMERICA'S NEWEST DRUG MAFIA. Guess which country is taking over a growing slice of Latin America's narcotics business? As strange as it sounds, Nigeria.<P>

   ``It's the most unusual phenomenon I have ever encountered,'' U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert S. Gelbard told reporters at a Florida International University seminar Friday. ``We now see Nigerian trafficking groups as one of the most dangerous threats in terms of the drug business.''<P>

   According to Gelbard, who heads the State Department's narcotics and law enforcement department, Nigerian drug lords protected by their country's military are employing thousands of ``mules'' -- people hired to smuggle drugs -- around the world.<P>

   More than 40 percent of the heroin seized in America recently has been handled by Nigerian passport holders, he said. Also, Nigerian drug traffickers are shipping cocaine from Colombia to Brazil and other Latin American nations, and from there to Europe.<P>

   In recent weeks, Nigerian passport holders have been arrested on drug trafficking charges in the Colombian capital's airport of El Dorado. A few weeks earlier, six people with Nigerian passports were arrested on drug smuggling charges in Paraguay.<P>

   ``Now the Nigerians are recruiting young, white women . . . as mules,'' Gelbard said. ``The problem will be one of increasing severity in Latin America.''<BR>

<B>CUBA:</B> ATTEMPTS ON CASTRO'S LIFE? Daniel Alarcon Ramirez, the once well-placed Cuban official who recently defected in France, has generated new speculation that there were recent attempts on Cuban President Fidel Castro's life.<P>

   The defector, known since his guerrilla days as ``Benigno,'' says in his book Life and Death of the Cuban Revolution, released over the weekend in France, that Castro narrowly escaped a murder attempt in 1994, as he was jogging with a bodyguard on a Havana race track.<P>

   A previous attack had taken place during a visit to Venezuela in 1989, he said in a telephone interview from Paris. Alarcon, 56, said he got the information on both attacks from a senior Cuban official.<P>

   The story of the 1994 attack may corroborate a similar account published last year by Vanity Fair magazine, which said five men had fired on a car carrying Castro in April 1994.<P>

   On the previous attack in Venezuela, a Cuban military defector who was part of Castro's entourage on his visit to that country disputes Alarcon's story, saying nothing of that sort happened on that trip. The jury is still out.<BR>

<B>PANAMA:</B> VOID IN WASHINGTON. The decision of Gabriel Lewis Galindo, Panama's foreign minister, take a leave of absence from his job for health reasons, announced last week, will complicate Panama's talks with Washington over the future of U.S. bases in that country.<P>

   Lewis Galindo has been Panama's best-connected diplomat in Washington since the days of the Panama Canal treaty negotiations. Ricardo Alberto Arias, until now Panama's ambassador to Washington, has taken over as acting foreign minister.<P>

   ``It won't be easy to fill the Washington Embassy job with somebody with either Lewis Galindo or Arias' connections,'' says Gustavo Gorriti, a journalist with Panama's influential daily La Prensa. ``They lost a very strong player.''<BR>

<B>ARGENTINE CANDIDATE:</B> STUDYING IN MIAMI. Former Argentine folk music star-turned-governor Ramon ``Palito'' Ortega has enrolled at Florida International University to take a course in Latin American economic affairs in preparation for his bid for the 1999 presidential elections.<P>

   ``It's a two-month course,'' Ortega told us. ``In July, I'm going back to Argentina to start the campaign.''
