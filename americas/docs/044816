mummy to stay home <ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   <m0>LIMA <m0>(--) Peruvian archaeologists pressed the government Wednesday to block plans to send a 500-year-old frozen mummy of an Inca girl to the United States, saying the fragile remains could be damaged.<ep>
   The mummy, known as the ``Ice Princess,'' was discovered on a mountain peak in southern Peru in October, and is believed to be the best example of a frozen mummy ever found.<ep>
   The Catholic University of Santa Maria in Arequipa, which has control of the mummy, plans to ship it to the United States on Saturday for study by scientists at John Hopkins University in Baltimore and display by the National Geographic Society in Washington.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>RIO DE JANEIRO <m0>(--) Police have arrested three suspected kidnappers and freed a hostage who had been chained to a tree for 16 days.<ep>
   Alexandre Heng Fai Tsang, 26, was found unharmed Tuesday in Rio's Tijuca National Forest, a member of the police Anti-Kidnapping Division said Wednesday. <ep>
   Tsang, the grandson of a prominent restaurant owner, was kidnapped April 21 at one of the family's restaurants in Rio's fashionable South Zone. He told police his captors kept him chained by his ankle to a tree the entire time, protected by a tarpaulin. He was fed only crackers and water every two days.<ql>

<m1><ue5><m0>Official: Europe talks <ql>
are `very complex' <ql>
<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   Cuba's Deputy Foreign Minister Isabel Allende tried to put a positive spin Wednesday on the suspension of talks leading to an economic pact with the European Union, saying the talks represent ``a very complex negotiation that could last a long time.''<ep>
   ``We have jointly decided to continue and deepen our exploratory talks,'' Allende said in Brussels. ``We don't see a need to speed up the process but [we want] to achieve solid results.'' <ep>
  A European Union spokesman said Tuesday that contacts with Havana will continue but negotiations for a broad cooperation agreement were put on hold because Cuba failed to meet terms that included human rights reform. <m2><ep>
