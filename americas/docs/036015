<m1>P<m0>essimistic observers of contemporary Latin America frequently point to the fragility of Latin democracies. Among other ills, they rightly cite endemic public corruption and the glaring defects in the region's judicial systems. <ep>
   Corruption so concerns the region's governments that it inspired the Organization of American States to draw up and ratify an important Inter-American Convention Against Corruption last March. It commits the signatories to introduce laws aimed at criminalizing transnational bribery and other crimes associated with public venality.<ep>
   Before signing the anti-corruption convention, the OAS had been focusing its energies on the collective defense and promotion of democracy. In the last few weeks, the hemisphere can point proudly (--) and with a degree of justified caution (--) to three heartening cases where democracy has either been strengthened or where authoritarianism has suffered setbacks.<ep>
   In Paraguay last month, the timely intervention of the U.S., Argentine, and Brazilian ambassadors persuaded President Juan Carlos Wasmosy not to resign when it appeared that a senior army general was about to stage a coup against his government. During the crisis, President Wasmosy accepted the protection of U.S. Ambassador Robert Service, who put him up at the U.S. Embassy. This <m4>END OF LEG 1 <m2><ql>
<m0>gesture no doubt sent a shattering message to the <m0>putschists.<m0><ep>
   Also last month, Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer appeared to accept the legitimacy of the independent electoral observers who will oversee his country's May 16 presidential vote. This network of election watchdogs has backing from the United States and other foreign governments.<ep>
   It was set up after widespread fraud marred the 1994 Dominican elections. To avert a national crisis, Dominican parties accepted the mediation of the OAS, which helped midwife the pact that defused the Dominican crisis. <ep>
   Finally, on April 15, at last the Mexican government presented a set of <m1> <m0>political reforms that, despite a boycott of the leading opposition party, represent in theory an advance toward the transformation of the Mexican state that President Ernesto Zedillo has long promised. The reforms center on making it easier for ordinary Mexicans to initiate petition drives for the purpose of holding national referendums; on giving all national political parties more equitable access to the media; and on granting genuine independence to the national Electoral Commission.<ep>
   The health of Latin American democracy may not be as robust as the optimists believe. But as these three April examples indicate, neither is it as dispiriting as the pessimists suggest.<ql>
