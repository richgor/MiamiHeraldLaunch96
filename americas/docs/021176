<m0>   <m0>PORT-AU-PRINCE <m0>(--) Arguing that the future of Haiti's seven million people cannot be held ransom by a few thousand government workers, President Rene Preval on Tuesday defended his plan to privatize state companies.<ep>
   ``I have come to change things, and change things I will,'' Preval told his first news conference since he was inaugurated Feb. 7 to succeed Jean-Bertrand Aristide.<ep>
   Preval spoke on the eve of a street demonstration planned by 17 grass-roots groups to protest the new government's economic policy. The groups accuse the International Monetary Fund of pressuring the government to privatize state companies, which they said could wipe out half the 12,000 jobs provided by the companies.<ql>

<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   A U.S. federal court in San Francisco has upheld a ban on travel to Cuba, saying it does not violate the civil rights of U.S. citizens. <ep>
   ``The purpose of the prohibition is the same now as it has been since it was imposed nearly 35 years ago: to restrict the flow of capital to Cuba,'' the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals said in a ruling Monday. <ep>
   The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel noted that other courts had found the purpose of the measure to be important, substantial and vital. Rejecting an attempt to rescind the ban on the grounds that the Cold War is over, the panel said it would not second-guess the president in the exercise of foreign policy.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>SANTO DOMINGO<m0> (--) The Dominican Republic agreed Tuesday to round up and return cars stolen in the United States and shipped to the Caribbean country. <ep>
   Foreign Minister Carlos Morales Troncoso signed an agreement with U.S. Ambassador Donna Hrinak under which each country will return cars stolen in the other nation.<ep>
   Hundreds of cars stolen in the United States have been brought illegally to the Dominican Republic to be sold in the last few years, Hrinak said. Dominican authorities have helped recover dozens of the vehicles, she said.<ep>
