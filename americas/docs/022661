<m0>   <m0>BOGOTA<m0> (--) In the latest blow to his scandal-plagued administration, President Ernesto Samper accepted the resignation of his finance minister Monday.<ep>
   Guillermo Perry resigned over the weekend, saying his departure would enable him to better defend the president against charges he took drug money to finance his 1994 campaign.<ep>
   Samper named former Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo, head of the government's economic planning office, to replace Perry.<ql>

<m0>   Cuban Col. Daniel Alarcon Ramirez, a former comrade-in-arms of Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara and ex-bodyguard to President Fidel Castro, has asked for political asylum in France, exile sources in Paris say.<ep>
   Alarcon arrived in Paris last fall to promote his book <m0>Che's Survivors<m0> and obtained Havana's permission to stay, saying he wanted to write another book there, the sources said.<ep>
   In that book, <m0>Life and Death of the Cuban Revolution, <m0>Alarcon complains about ``the repression, vexations, hunger, [and] misery'' that plague the island. The book will be released Friday in Paris.<ep>
