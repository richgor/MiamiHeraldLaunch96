<m0>   <m0>HAVANA <m0>(--) An anti-cholera vaccine developed through genetic engineering is being tested on humans, Gustavo Sierra, head of Cuba's Program of Vaccine and Research and Development, said Thursday. <ep>
   Sierra said the initial tests have shown promising results and researchers hope to achieve a vaccine that can be effective with a single dose. <ep>
    He said the Cuban vaccine is prepared with attenuated live bacteria. Cuban officials had announced last year that they hoped to have a cholera vaccine on the market by the end of 1995 but Sierra did not explain the apparent delay. <m1> <ql>
