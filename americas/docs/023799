<m0>   <m0>RIO DE JANEIRO <m0>(--) A Rio state trooper who stunned a courtroom by coolly describing how he executed a street urchin was convicted Tuesday of murdering six children and sentenced to 309 years in prison.<ep>
   ``I fired, and I fired again,'' Marcos Vinicius Emmanuel said Monday at the start of his trial, seen as a test of Brazil's commitment to defend human rights.<ep>
   The slain boy was one of eight street children shot to death the night of July 23, 1993. Six were sleeping on the sidewalk near Candelaria Cathedral in downtown Rio.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>PORT-AU-PRINCE <m0>(--) Arguing that the future of Haiti's seven million people cannot be held ransom by a few thousand government workers, President Rene Preval on Tuesday defended his plan to privatize state companies.<ep>
   ``I have come to change things, and change things I will,'' Preval told his first news conference since he was inaugurated Feb. 7 to succeed Jean-Bertrand Aristide.<ep>
   Preval spoke on the eve of a street demonstration planned by 17 grass-roots groups to protest the new government's economic policy. The groups accuse the International Monetary Fund of pressuring the government to privatize state companies, which they said could wipe out half the 12,000 jobs provided by the companies.<ql>

<m1><ue5><ep>
<m0>   A U.S. federal court in San Francisco has upheld a ban on travel to Cuba, saying it does not violate the civil rights of U.S. citizens. <ep>
   ``The purpose of the prohibition is the same now as it has been since it was imposed nearly 35 years ago: to restrict the flow of capital to Cuba,'' the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals said in a ruling Monday. <ep>
   The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel noted that other courts had found the purpose of the measure to be important, substantial and vital. Rejecting an attempt to rescind the ban on the grounds that the Cold War is over, the panel said it would not second-guess the president in the exercise of foreign policy.<ql>
