   BUENOS AIRES -- Urged by Pope John Paul II to examine their consciences, Argentina's Roman Catholic bishops begged forgiveness Saturday for any crimes committed by Catholic Church members during the country's internal war against leftists in the 1970s and 80s.<P>

   ``We implore God's forgiveness for the crimes committed then, especially by sons of the church, whether as members of the revolutionary guerrillas or as members of the state or the security forces,'' members of the National Bishops Conference said in a statement.<P>

   The 15-page document was issued in response to the pope's instructions to bishops worldwide to examine their consciences in preparation for 2000, when the church enters its third millennium.<BR>
<LI> BUENOS AIRES -- President Carlos Menem and Chilean President Eduardo Frei signed agreements Friday to cooperate in controlling their shared border and to improve trade links. ``There exists no possibility of border problems with Chile from now on,'' Menem said after three days of talks with Frei.<BR>
PARAGUAY Ruling party members <BR>
to vote for a leader <BR>
<P>

   ASUNCION -- Just days after a general's rebellion threatened to return Paraguay to its military-dominated past, the country's fragile democracy reasserts itself today in an election to pick the head of the ruling Colorado Party.<P>

   An estimated 800,000 party members will cast ballots in the election, given extra relevance by the turmoil of the past week.<P>

   The main contenders are Vice President Angel Seifart, a member of Paraguay's first democratically elected government in more than 40 years, and Luis Arga&ntilde;a, a member of former military ruler Gen. Alfredo Stroessner's government, which was ousted in a 1989 coup. <BR>

HAITI Rightist held 8 months <BR>
is freed without trial <BR>
<P>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE -- Rightist political prisoner Carl Denis has been released, eight months after his incarceration on charges of subversion, private Radio Signal F.M. reported Saturday.<P>

   Police released Denis on Friday from prison in Petionville, a suburb of the capital city, and drove him directly to the international airport where he took a flight to Miami, the report said. <P>

   Denis was arrested Aug. 18 after giving a press conference where he predicted imminent political turmoil. Police said ammunition and several weapons were found in his home but he was never brought to trial.<BR>
