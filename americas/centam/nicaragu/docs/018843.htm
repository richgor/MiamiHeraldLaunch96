   TROJES, Honduras -- Santos Barrientos remembers the day he was picking coffee on his family's plot near the Nicaraguan frontier when he stepped on a land mine, destroying his right leg and badly burning his left leg.<P>

   No longer able to tend to his crops, Barrientos is supported by his wife, who works as a dressmaker. As the young man decribes the boredom and the despair of the last 18 months is an audible strain in his voice.<P>

   ``There have been many times I thought I would have liked to die instead. It's not easy to see yourself healthy and whole one minute and then as a cripple the next,'' he says.<P>

   Six years after fighting between the U.S.-backed contra rebels and the Marxist Sandinista government ended, Nicaragua's civil war is still claiming victims.<P>

   Although numbers are difficult to confirm, Honduran authorities cited in the local press say that up to 1,500 people have been maimed or killed in the last 10 years by some 30,000 land mines believed to have been planted indiscriminately in Honduras by both sides in the conflict.<P>

   Sparsely populated tropical forests and steep mountain ridges were transformed into a battle zone by 15,000 contras who used neighboring Honduras, the closest U.S. ally during the war and the beneficiary of millions of dollars in aid, as a launching point for incursions into Nicaragua.<P>

   Some 30,000 to 40,000 Honduran peasants either fled or were caught in the cross-fire. Of those who have since returned, many are unable or afraid to work their abandoned farms, now sown with mines. Those who have tried, have paid the price -- with loss of limbs or lives.<P>

   In an attempt to reclaim precious farmland in the impoverished country, Honduras is endeavoring to remove the remnants of the decade-long war.<P>

   Following a request for aid in 1992, the Organization of American States, in conjunction with the Inter-American Defense Board, sent experts from Brazil, Colombia and the United States to train four Honduran sapper units, and last October the search for mines began.<P>

   So far, 54,750 square yards have been cleared of mines, paving the way for the return of 100 families. The work is slow, compounded by harsh terrain and the absence of mine registries, soldiers instead having to rely on reports of mines from local peasants.<P>

   Foraging through the thick undergrowth, the sappers have recovered 142 Czech and Soviet-made mines along with bullets, rusted guns and the remains of fallen rebels.<P>

   ``For peasants who live with suspected mine areas around them and their families, the war hasn't ended. That's why this is so important,'' says Lt. Col. Jorge Pinto Fraxe, Brazilian commander of the OAS-IADB mission.<P>

   But with 200 square miles suspected of containing land mines and only a fraction cleared, the project had run up a $3 million bill in two years and was facing an end to funding in March. Through last minute intervention of the OAS, Sweden and Japan have agreed to provide funding until September.<P>

   But with approximately two to 2 1/2 years of work left to clear the area, Honduras faces the same fate as Nicaragua, where de-mining was suspended in 1993 as foreign aid ran out. Nicaragua, which has an estimated 132,000 mines buried throughout its territory, is awaiting renewed financial assistance.<P>

   Costa Rica is another victim of the Nicaraguan war, with approximately 5,000 to 6,000 mines along its northern border. It has asked for OAS help to remove the mines. Work is set to begin there this month at an initial cost of $1 million.<P>

   Faced with the growing demand for de-mining assistance, the OAS has begun talks that will continue over the next few months with a number of possible donor countries including Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, the United States and Canada, aimed at providing funding on an ongoing basis.<P>

   In Honduras, at least, some feel that the Americans should be footing most of the bill. The United States has contributed $230,000 in fuel, rations and explosives to the Honduran mission, a small amount in terms of not only the de-mining costs but to Hondurans who continue to pay for the war, says Lt. Col. Jose Barohona Perez, head of the Honduran sapper troops.<P>

   ``It's the United States' moral responsibility to help us with this project,'' says Barohona. ``The U.S. says it's not their responsibility but they know it is their fault. Everybody does.''
