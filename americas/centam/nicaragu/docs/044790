   LA CRUZ DE RIO GRANDE, Nicaragua (--) Smiles are rare and words are few here. Even the scrawny village dogs are silent and wary.<ep>
   In this sullen, tense little village, the presence of strangers usually means trouble for everyone but the town carpenter. He's the one who builds the coffins.<ep>
  La Cruz de Rio Grande, atop a riverside bluff in the rugged jungles of eastern Nicaragua, sits at the ragged edge of civilization. Law is just a vague utopian memory. Rape, robbery, kidnapping and murder are the order of the day.<ep>
  ``They have a lot of trouble here,'' says Guillermo Alarcon, who ferries passengers up and down the river in a motorized launch. ``Every time I come, there is shooting and killing.''<ep>
  Not that the townspeople care to discuss it, at least with outsiders.<ep>
   ``We don't have any problems here, we get along with everyone,'' says Rafael Ramirez, the doctor who runs La Cruz de Rio Grande's six-room medical clinic. As he says it, he's standing in front of a hole, perhaps six feet in diameter, in one of the clinic's walls. What made it?<ep>
  ``An RPG-7,'' a rocket-propelled grenade, the doctor replies without changing expression.<ep>
  Located in the middle of Zelaya province, La Cruz de Rio Grande is at the eastern edge of a long, crescent-shaped chunk of Nicaragua (--) stretching from the Honduran border to the east side of Lake Nicaragua (--) where the government has virtually ceased to function.<ep>
   Nicaragua's army and police forces rarely venture into the zone, which covers several thousand square miles. Instead, it is governed by bands of gunmen known as <m0>rearmados<m0>, the re-armed ones. As the name implies, some are stragglers left over from the last war, nursing grudges that are at least vaguely political; others make no pretense that they are anything but criminals. The majority are former contras (--) opponents of the previous Sandinista government (--) and their sympathizers, but they also include former Sandinista soldiers. What they share is a chilling ruthlessness.<ep>
   ``When <m0>rearmados<m0>  pass through a community, the people have to give them food and medicine and whatever things they want,'' says Donald Weil, southeastern regional director of Nicaragua's public health service. ``Otherwise, the possibility exists (--) well, the probability (--) that they'll be killed.''<ep>
  The problem of the <m0>rearmados<m0>  is nothing new. It became apparent within months after the newly elected government of President Violeta Chamorro signed a peace treaty with the U.S.-backed contra rebels in 1990, ending an eight-year civil war.<ep>
   By patiently negotiating with the largest of the groups, the government has whittled the number of <m0>rearmados<m0>  from thousands down to around 600, by some accounts.<ql>
<m1>Awash in weapons<ep>
<m0>   But the remaining groups are well armed (--) Nicaragua, at the center of a mini-arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the 1980s, is still awash in weapons (--) and make a formidable adversary for the Nicaraguan army. <ep>
   The most powerful of the <m0>rearmado  <m0>leaders is Charro, a former contra rebel whose real name is Ciriaco Palacios. He operates in the northern part of the crescent, with perhaps as many as 180 men. The Nicaraguan army is trying to negotiate a peace treaty with him, as it has with several other northern warlords.<ep>
  But the situation may be even worse on the eastern side of the crescent, the troubled no man's land that includes La Cruz de Rio Grande. <ep>
   ``When the old [Sandinista] government fell, we were left here with no government,'' says Theodore Niehaus, an American priest from Sauk Centre, Minn., who has lived in La Cruz de Rio Grande for 18 years. ``We had five policemen to cover all the way to Matagalpa,'' 110 miles west.<ep>
  Last year, when the police heard rumors that the <m0>rearmados<m0>  were planning an attack, they turned over their weapons to half a dozen or so volunteers and fled. The attack came four days later.<ql>
<m1>`A real firefight'<ep>
<m0>  ``The shooting started at 4 a.m.,'' Niehaus recalls with a shudder. ``It was terrible, a real firefight. It went on for four hours. There were about 65 <m0>rearmados, <m0>but the six volunteer police somehow held them off. Three times, during lulls in the shooting, I went out to talk to them. `You're shooting up the whole town,' I said. `Don't you see all these people are in their houses? They'll all be killed.'<ep>
  `` `That's true,' the <m0>rearmado  <m0>leader said. `But we haven't done justice yet. We can't leave until we do justice.' He said some of the volunteer policemen had killed a former contra leader in another village a few miles from here.''<ep>
  The battle ended when a couple of the volunteer police officers managed to slip through the <m0>rearmado<m0>  lines in the dark and attack them from the rear with rocket-propelled grenades. The <m0>rearmados<m0>, believing the Nicaraguan army had arrived, retreated into the jungle, forcing 10 townspeople to help carry their wounded. Only eight came back.<ep>
  ``The other two had served in the Sandinista army during the war, and the <m0>rearmados<m0>  were mostly former contras,'' Niehaus says. ``To them, anybody who was with the Sandinistas is still an enemy. We're pretty sure the bodies of the two men are out there on a mountain someplace.''<ql>
<m1>A deadly place<ep>
<m0>   Two months after the <m0>rearmado<m0>  attack, the Nicaraguan army sent 15 soldiers to protect La Cruz de Rio Grande. Since then the town has been spared further violence, but the nearby countryside is still a deadly place. Four peasants were murdered a few miles away in late January, and rapes and robberies are common.<ep>
  Among those most affected are the 17 health-care workers at the town clinic, who routinely circulate through the countryside, seeing patients too ill or too poor to make the trip to La Cruz de Rio Grande. The clinic was badly shot up during the attack last year, and rearmados stole its radio (--) the town's sole link with the outside world.<m2><ep>
