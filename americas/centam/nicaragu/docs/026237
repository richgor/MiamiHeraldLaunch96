<m0>   MANAGUA (--) Stepping out of the airliner still feels like walking into a blast furnace. The hot wind sears your face as the acrid scent of a thousand wood cooking fires claws your nostrils. No mistaking <m0>that<m0>.<ep>
   But where's that painting of Sandino, with its smile that was intended to be benevolent but somehow came out suggesting Big Brother? And where are all the men in olive green, their mouths cold, their eyes concealed by mirrored sunglasses as they examine your passport?<ep>
   Can this really be Managua?<ep>
   ``Do we still have to pay $60 just to get into the country?'' asked another passenger (--) obviously, like me, a time traveler. In the old days, when the Sandinistas were running Nicaragua, you had to exchange $60 (and, no matter what country you were from, they had to be <m0>dollars<m0>, no francs or marks or colones or pesos) for cordobas at the official rate. That was barely enough money to get a cab to your hotel. Many a newspaper editor blanched (--) and, later, shrieked (--) when the Managua expense account came in.<ep>
   I spent more time than I care to recall in Nicaragua during the 1980s, covering a civil war that, frankly, I never expected to end. Day by day, I watched the country slide back into <m1> <m0>the 19th Century. I thought surely the economy had bottomed out one morning in 1988 when I saw a horse trudging down the highway from the airport into Managua, pulling a sawed-off back end of an Oldsmobile that had been converted into a cart.<ep>
<m0>   Paper currency on a roll<ep>
<m0>   But Nicaragua will always surprise you. A few months later, another journalist called to tell me her jeep had broken down on a jungle road. A couple of peasants offered to guard it while she hitchhiked back to Managua to obtain a spare part.<ep>
   ``Great,'' the reporter enthused. ``And I'll pay you. How many cordobas?''<ep>
   ``We don't want any cordobas,'' replied a peasant. ``Could you just give us toilet paper instead?''<ep>
   After all those years, returning to Managua is a surreal experience. I keep expecting Rod Serling to step out from behind the twisted steel-and-concrete corpses that still dot what was downtown before the 1972 earthquake (those, at least, look just the same) and begin to narrate.<ep>
   A Pizza Hut in Managua? No, <m0>two<m0>. The Gabe's Burgers chain has long since closed its doors in Miami, but the post-Sandinista entrepreneur who pirated the name and logo is still doing a brisk business in Managua.<ep>
   The dry, cracked roadsides have been planted with <m0>can~afistula<m0> <m0>de oro<m0> and <m0>flor de leche<m0> trees, and much of the city's dusty brown visage has given way to splashes of green and gold and pink. The evening sky is cross-stitched with threads of pink and green neon, calling cards of a tentative new nightlife.<ep>
<m0>   Questionable commerce<ep>
<m0>   Not all the changes are necessarily for the better. Another side of that nightlife: Intersections around the Inter-Continental Hotel are crowded with young women in blouses down to here and skirts up to there, blowing kisses at passing autos. Their interest is commerce, not romance.<ep>
   A few days after my arrival, Nicaragua celebrated the Day of the Secretary, so I set off in search of the Galleria, a department store I'd seen advertised in one of the local papers, to buy a gift. When we pulled up outside, my companion was confused. ``Doesn't this look familiar?'' she asked. ``Isn't this the <m0>diplotienda<m0>?''<ep>
   So it was (--) the old hard-currency store, a smaller version of the ones the Sandinistas' big brothers built in Moscow and Havana. Inside, just like the old days, is a consumer cornucopia of color TVs and blenders and designer jeans. The only difference is that now you don't have to be a diplomat or a <m0>comandante's<m0> girlfriend to go in. Can this really be Managua?<ql>
