   TASBA POUNIE, Nicaragua -- The examination room was dim, and the bats nesting in the ceiling swooped down every so often on inspection flights.<P>

   The air, simmering under the Caribbean sun, was like hot soup. And the line outside the crumbling concrete building grew like a jungle vine: Forty-seven patients, many with squalling children tucked under their arms, signed up in the first 10 minutes.<P>

   Still, Dr. John Peters looked on the bright side.<P>

   ``Nobody's shooting at us,'' he observed. ``Nobody's dropping bombs on us. And we didn't have to parachute in, either.''<P>

   For the past 17 years, Peters has been touring the world's trouble spots, stitching up wounds and splinting broken bones, cleaning up the debris left by the temper tantrums of nature and man. Earthquakes in Peru, hurricanes in Honduras, plague in Bolivia, civil wars in Rwanda, Soviet invaders in Afghanistan. The Adventure Doc has seen them all, usually from a closer angle than any sane person would care to share.<P>

   He doesn't do it for the money. He guesses his peculiar brand of tourism has cost him nearly $200,000 in out-of-pocket expenses over the years, not to mention a truly horrifying amount in lost income from his private practice. <P>

   And it's certainly not for his health. He broke his back and fractured his pelvis on a parachute jump in Guatemala a few years ago.<P>

   Peters left his practice in Battle Mountain, Nev., again last month to spend five days among the hardscrabble villages of Nicaragua's impoverished Atlantic Coast. He brought along three paramedics, $18,000 of begged and borrowed medicine and equipment -- and, in a symbol of the comparative tranquillity of the trip, his 16-year-old daughter Mandy.<P>

   It was Peters' third visit to the Atlantic Coast since 1991. <P>

Neglected by government<P>

   Historically estranged from and neglected by the government in Managua, the southern half of the coast has just 48 ill-equipped doctors to treat 80,000 inhabitants. Roads are almost unknown along the coast. Villages like Tasba Pounie, six hours upriver from the provincial capital of Bluefields, go years at a time without seeing a doctor.<P>

   ``We've had doctors here before,'' says Clarinda Omeier Eower, who manages the tiny ``pharmacy'' -- no more than a handful of aspirin and antibiotic pills -- in Tasba Pounie's clinic. ``But it's impossible to get medicines or anything, and pretty soon they get cold feet.''<P>

   That means relatively simple medical problems can quickly escalate into lethal crises. In this fishing village of 1,400, where a single death reverberates into every corner of the community, the cost has been fearful.<P>

   ``Last year we had a patient, a 62-year-old man, die of diarrhea,'' Eower recalls. ``There were just two nurses here, no doctor, and they had nothing to rehydrate him with. Then we had a lady die giving birth. She couldn't pass the placenta.'' <P>

Providing lights<P>

   During the visit, the paramedics taught simple first-aid procedures and installed a solar panel to provide Tasba Pounie's clinic with lights when the balky electrical system is down. They were all from the Battle Mountain Volunteer Fire Department, paying their own way at $3,000 a pop. <P>

   Peters, meanwhile, saw patients -- lots of them. His first clients were 35-year-old Alicia Christian and her 2-month-old daughter, Nicole. <P>

   ``I've been coughing up terrible yellow stuff for two days,'' the mother said. ``It won't stop. And now the baby's coughing, too. She's running a fever.'' <P>

   Peters peered down her throat with a flashlight.<P>

   ``Have you ever had asthma?'' he asked. ``Yes,'' the surprised mother admitted. ``But not for 15 years.''<P>

   ``Well, I think it's come back,'' Peters said as he checked little Nicole with a stethoscope. ``The baby just has a cold, nothing to worry about. But make sure to give her lots of fluids. You have to be careful of dehydration with a new baby -- they can get very sick, very easily.''<P>

Mild in comparison<P>

   The parade of sick and worried patients continued all afternoon. But even the most serious -- two children with possible cases of tuberculosis -- seemed mild compared to the crushed limbs and torn shrapnel wounds that Peters is accustomed to seeing on his overseas trips.<P>

   ``This is pretty restful compared to the last place I was,'' he says. That was Burma, where he went earlier this year to work with the Karen, a right-wing mountain tribe that has been waging guerrilla war against the military government for nearly 50 years.<P>

   ``Mostly what I deal with there is injuries from land mines,'' Peters explains.<P>

   When Peters made his first overseas trip, he didn't expect to become an expert on land mine casualties. It was 1970, and a mammoth earthquake 375 miles northeast of Lima had left a big chunk of Peru in ruins. Worse yet, it had cut off all the roads to the east side of the Andes. There were rumors of a smallpox epidemic.<P>

   Peters, then practicing medicine in the Colorado Rockies, had done some sport parachuting, so he answered a call for doctors with experience at high altitude jumps.<P>

   Peruvian pilots had to be ordered -- literally at gunpoint -- into wheezing C-47 cargo planes to fly over the Andes. On the first mission, the pilot got lost and dropped 10 medics on the wrong side of a 15,000-foot peak.<P>

Landing on target<P>

   Peters jumped three days later, landing right on target in the city of Sihaus, but all his equipment was lost. The rumor of smallpox was wrong; the disease ravaging Sihaus was measles. He helplessly watched 11 children die in the next 10 days before the government managed to drop a shipment of vaccine and antibiotics.<P>

   ``After that we were able to do some good, although by then anybody who was injured in the earthquake was either dead or recovering on their own,'' he says. <P>

   The trip, which was expected to last 10 days, stretched into five weeks. ``Despite everything, it was kind of fun,'' Peters remembers. <P>

   Two years later, he got calls from some of the medics who had jumped with him into Peru. An earthquake had left Managua in ruins. Did Peters want to join them on a trip to Nicaragua? ``After that, I was hooked,'' he says.<P>

   Prancing through the world's war zones has not exactly enhanced Peters' domestic life. ``I've had three wives, so I guess you'd have to say they haven't cared for it much,'' Peters, 62, admits. Still, there are signs that after 16 years of marriage, wife No. 3 -- Roxanne, a nurse -- is mellowing. ``She used to get [angry] when I'd tell her I was going somewhere,'' Peters notes. ``Now she just smiles and buys more insurance.''
