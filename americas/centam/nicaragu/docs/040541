   MANAGUA (--) A mysterious Nicaraguan millionaire whose race for the presidency was just beginning to get off the ground has been swept up in an equally mysterious banking scandal centered thousands of miles away.<ep>
   Alvaro Robelo, ranked third in the presidential race in some opinion polls, professes bewilderment at reports from Italy that he is a key figure in a $12.5 billion money-laundering scheme.<ep>
   ``I find myself in the middle of a game that I don't understand,'' says Robelo, who until launching his campaign in December was a little-known banker.<ep>
   He's not the only one. <ep>
   Diplomats and financiers in Managua are incredulous at the claims of Italian prosecutors, who say Robelo and his tiny Nicaraguan bank are at the center of a gigantic scandal that supposedly involves forged paintings, bank accounts looted by computer hackers and secret machinations by the CIA and Freemasons.<ep>
   ``These prosecutors are saying that $970 million was moved into Robelo's bank for laundering,'' says one financial analyst. ``My God! That would blow every computer in Nicaragua.''<ql>
<m1>Trouble in Italy<ep>
<m0>   The scandal erupted Friday in the northern Italian city of Aosta, where prosecutor Davide Monti announced that an investigation code-named Operation Phony Money had cracked open an international money-laundering ring.<ep>
   Monti said 18 Italians were under arrest, but ``we have only just begun.'' A principal part of the scheme, he said, involved a fictitious deposit of $970 million in gold in a Nicaraguan bank, supposedly to finance the owner's presidential candidacy. Later most of the money would be ``returned,'' apparently clean.<ep>
   The prosecutor didn't name the bank or its owner, but there's only one banker running for the presidency here: Robelo, who with U.S. and Italian partners owns the Banco Europeo de Centro America.<ep>
<m1>The former ambassador<ep>
<m0>   Robelo lived in Italy for nearly three decades and served as Nicaragua's ambassador to the country for three years.<ep>
   ``Clearly, it's me,'' Robelo told The Herald. ``They haven't said my name. But I'm the only one here with contacts in Italian banking circles.''<ep>
   But, he quickly added, the charges are ``absurd.''<ep>
   ``We've had continual harassment since I went into politics,'' Robelo said. ``There's been harassment of my campaign, harassment of my family, harassment as we travel the world. This is just the latest.''<ep>
   Robelo said the harassment, up to now, has come at the hands of other Nicaraguan political parties fearful of the snowballing success of his fledgling Up With Nicaragua party. <ep>
<m1>Robelo alleges a setup<ep>
<m0>   ``When they saw these big campaign demonstrations I was staging, when they saw my organizational capacity, the traditional parties went on alert,'' he said. ``But this [banking scandal] has to be a setup by foreign intelligence agencies.''<ep>
   And why would foreign intelligence agencies care about the third-place presidential candidate in a political outback like Nicaragua?<ep>
   ``Maybe it's because I want to build an inter-oceanic canal across Nicaragua,'' Robelo suggests. ``Maybe that threatens someone's interests . . . but I really don't know. I don't have a clear idea of why they're doing it. I'm trying to analyze it.''<ep>
   Other bankers, including some who don't care for him personally or politically, say Robelo's explanation makes at least as much sense as that of the Italian prosecutors. The entire Nicaraguan banking system has assets of only about $1 billion, which would make it impossible to conceal a sudden $970 million leap in deposits, they argue. The country's bank regulators say they have seen no indication of irregularities at Robelo's bank.<ql>
<m1>A $970 million mystery<ep>
<m0>   ``And how would $970 million get here?'' asked one banker. ``It's going to have to move through a Swiss or U.S. bank. There are authorities and regulators in other countries that would have to be fooled, too.''<ep>
   Oddly enough, this is the second major Italian bank scandal to touch Nicaragua. In the early 1980s, Italy's Banco Ambrosiano crashed after revelations of irregularities and money laundering involving a Masonic lodge known as P-2 and Italian premier Benito Craxi. Some of the tainted money moved through Banco Ambrosiano's branch in Managua.<ep>
   Craxi eventually fled Italy for Tunisia to escape criminal charges stemming from the Banco Ambrosiano scandal. He and Robelo are friends (--) Robelo's campaign manager has admitted that Craxi was solicited funds for Up With Nicaragua (--) which adds another strange twist to the story.<ql>
