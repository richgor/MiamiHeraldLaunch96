<m1><ep>
<m0>   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (--) Reba is a 150-pound Irish wolfhound and a blood donor. Today is her day to give.<ep>
   After administering a sedative, two veterinary technicians hoist Reba onto the operating table. They shave a patch of brindled fur from her neck and poke a needle into her jugular vein. As the collection bag starts to fill, one of the technicians presses Reba's neck to keep the blood flowing.<ep>
   Behind Reba, an EKG monitor marks the foothills and peaks of her steady heartbeat. Piped-in classical music sets a calming mood.<ep>
   More and more, pet owners are choosing to save their pets through medical procedures. That means clinics need blood.<ep>
   Of course, there's only one place to get dog blood: donor dogs.<ep>
   Jeff Dennis and his colleagues at Veterinary Specialists of Kansas City operate a blood donor program. They share space and equipment with the Emergency Veterinary Clinic of Greater Kansas City.<ep>
   The donor program, which started two years ago, may be the only one of its kind in the area. Refrigerated dog and cat blood always is on hand.<ql>
<m1>Transfusion needs vary<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Dennis named some of the common reasons cats and dogs might require blood: trauma, usually from getting hit by a car; poisoning, especially from ingesting rat poison; an immune-system disease in dogs that attacks red blood cells; and blood infections in cats.<ep>
   ``We see so many of these patients,'' said Dennis, ``that we needed to have blood.''<ep>
   Reba is a great donor because of her ponylike size (--) she can afford to lose a pint of blood (--) and her blood type. Canines have eight blood types (--) called ``markers'' in dogs. One of them, a ``universal'' type, can be used for most procedures. Cats have three blood types, and 95 percent of this country's cats are Type A.<ep>
   To set up a donor colony, the veterinarians approached staff members and the owners of some of their patients. Prospective donors got a medical checkup, including blood work. Only ``universal'' types in excellent health were chosen. In exchange for their service, the donors get regular checkups, treatment at cost and $25 fee, or a bag of pet food.<ep>
   ``We treat them as our special pets,'' Dennis said.<ep>
   The clinic calls on 15 donor dogs, all weighing more than 65 pounds. Besides Irish wolfhounds, donors include German shepherds, Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers and greyhounds. Dogs can donate once a month, which is about the shelf life of refrigerated blood.<ql>
<m1>Networking for blood<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Some other clinics contact Dennis when they need blood, or they identify a pet or two of their own they can call on in emergencies. Mission MedVet, an emergency clinic in suburban Mission, Kan., buys frozen and refrigerated blood products from an animal blood bank in California. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Veterinary services is a growing field. As owners' demands increase, veterinarians respond. Dennis recalled one dog owner whose pet suffered from ``immune mediated hemolytic anemia,'' the red blood cell disease. Dogs with the condition become lethargic and jaundiced, and their red blood cell count drops.<ep>
   Medication can save sufferers, but the patient also must be given blood as the medicine begins to work. Some dogs respond more quickly than others. One owner authorized 10 transfusions waiting for the treatment to work. Each transfusion can cost more than $100.<ep>
   ``We have some pretty motivated owners here,'' said Dennis.<ep>
   Back on the operating table, Reba's sedative is beginning to wear off, but she obediently lies still as the technicians pull the needle out of her neck. It helps that one of the technicians is Jan Winner, Reba's owner. Reba has to endure one more stick, an IV in her left hind leg.<ep>
   ``She would like cookies and juice,'' said Winner, ``but we just give her fluids.''<ql>
