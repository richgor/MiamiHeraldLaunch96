   Anticipating the onset of summer rains and the opportunity to reshape the landscape after the long, cool winter, South Florida gardeners can spend intervening weeks harvesting the bounty of new and useful garden books:<P>

   <LI> The Art of South Florida Gardening, by Harold Songdahl and Coralee Leon (Pineapple Press, $14.95).<P>

   <LI> Tropica1 Gardening, a collaborative effort led by Fairchild Tropical Garden and six other botanical gardens in the tropical and subtropical United States (Pantheon Press, $25).<P>

   <LI> Palms of South Florida, by George B. Stevenson (University Press of Florida, $19.95).<P>

   The Art of South Florida Gardening is aimed squarely at newcomers -- and most of us have gardened in these gloves -- who grew up waiting to plant vegetables until the danger of frost had passed. That South Florida's vegetable gardening season is just the opposite of that in Michigan or Ohio is but one of the things all of us must learn.<P>

   Songdahl, a Miami native, longtime nurseryman and consultant, teamed up with writer and gardener Leon to root out the mysteries of gardening in this place where the soil is deceptively infertile, where the bugs are multitudinous, where hurricanes or a periodic freeze can wipe clean the garden patch.<P>

   While recommending a limited palette of plants, The Art's forte is illuminating the techniques and confiding the right way. It advocates ways of gardening that resonate with admonitions of a veteran plantsman sharing his wisdom with young whippersnappers.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   Now and again, it singles out time-saving and plant-saving tips, in special boxes nicely designed into the layout, that have a neighborly, over-the-fence pssst-quality about them. Pssst: ``If you slip a few coffee filters into the bottom of a flowerpot to cover the hole before you fill the pot with soil, water will drain through but the soil won't.''<P>

   And, ``If you mix grass seed with an equal part of Milorganite, the seed will be more evenly distributed, and have something to eat when it sprouts.''<P>

   In like manner, recipes are offered (Millie Songdahl's Key lime pie), shortcuts shared and garden lore conveyed.<P>

   The style is sprightly, even folksy, imparting a friendliness that is meant to help you feel at home in a sometimes foreign landscape. There are line drawings of many plants discussed individually, and cartoon characters inserted in the page margins from time to time to bring visual relief without the expense of color photographs, just as the tips boxes add graphic interest.<P>

   Longtime gardeners may quibble over an occasional point, such as: ``Hardly any insects or diseases infect palms (watch for stinging saddleback caterpillar on some areca palms), but one palm tree killer wiped out nearly a generation of coconut and date palms in South Florida: lethal yellowing.''<P>

   Several things latch on to palms, from mealy bugs to leaf skeletonizers, scale, ganoderma, leaf-spotting diseases and nutritional deficiencies that can kill palms or lead to other complications. A wide range of palms are susceptible to the viral-like lethal yellowing disease, just as more than two palms are resistant to it, as the authors indicate.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   On the whole, however, the advice is sound, and Songdahl and Leon nonetheless have crammed their 264 pages with wily ways of doing things. They advocate Integrated Pest Management (monitoring insect populations carefully to keep an upper hand in insect control), encourage gardeners to recognize beneficial insects in the garden (from praying mantises to snakes), and warn against planting notoriously invasive trees that forestry professionals struggle to keep out ot natural areas.<P>

   The book is a welcome addition to South Florida gardeners' small but growing library of books relevant to this particular and peculiar growing zone.<P>

   Tropical Gardening  differs in approach by 180 degrees, which means it is complementary to the other book.<P>

   Aimed at tropical gardeners -- or more experienced, adventuresome South Florida gardeners ready to add exotic touches to their gardens -- this lushly illustrated book speaks in a more straighforward, perhaps professorial, tone. It is one of a series of books that tap the horticultural know-how found in 30 botanical gardens in the United States, called The American Garden Guides.<P>

   After a brief introduction explaining tropical gardening and tropical plants, as well as ``A Brief Lesson in Botany,'' which appears in all of the guides, the book launches into an alphabetical (by botanical name) listing of tropical landscape plants.<P>

   Called Plant Selector, the listing tells of the origins and uses of dozens of tropicals, discussing cultural information for each plant. This is the meatiest part, where suggestions for the use of each plant are included along with cultivars that are the best garden subjects or that need special care. Pests and diseases are listed, though techniques for combating them are saved for a later discussion.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   Succinct chapters cover garden design, garden techniques (look here for pest and disease management, as well as vine training, plant propagation and more), as well as special conditions such as growing tropical plants in cool conditions.<P>

   Hibiscus growers will discover there is a fragrant white hibiscus, Hibiscus waimeae, from the island of Kauai. Admirers of costus or spiral gingers will discover that the plants like light shade in the hottest part of the day; should be planted in fertile, moist and well-drained soil; may be propagated by cutting cane-like sections, laying them horizontally in a warm, moist bed.<P>

   Tropical bulb gardeners will discover that clivia lilies from South Africa will grow in temperatures above 80 degrees, but won't flower prolifically. Blue ginger, Dichorisandra thyrsiflora, (not a ginger, but related to wandering Jew) must not dry out and benefits from light applications to 20-20-20 once a month.<P>

   This book also uses boxed information as asides from the main text. Sacred tropical plants, historical notes, plant family tidbits, horticulturists' opinions on various subjects (the use of native plants, successful plant combination) are captured and held aside for perusal.<P>

   It disappoints in the listing of schinus (Brazilian pepper) among ``other plants.'' Because it is such a threat to the natural ecosystem of Florida, schinus cannot be legally planted in Dade County, yet receives but a rebuke here: ``It is notoriously weedy and can be toxic.'' Schefflera and African tulip are weeds in Hawaii, and they, too, are included.<P>

   David Bar-Zvi, chief horticulturist at Fairchild Tropical Garden, was the principal author, but contributors included professionals from Hawaiian botanical gardens, Bok Tower and Leu Botanical Gardens in Florida, Missouri Botanical Garden, and Houston.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   Tropical Gardening is part of a series of books that have tapped the horticultural know-how found in 30 botanical gardens in the United States. Each follows the some general format.<P>

   Palms of South Florida is a reprint of the 1974 book published by Fairchild Tropical Garden. It is as welcome as a long-lost friend, and will help palm enthusiasts understand the differences among the bewildering array of palms that grow here.<P>

   Stevenson developed a ``key'' to unlocking the identities of palms, and if you lend him some time, you can follow along. A key is a botanical construct for identifying plants that asks pairs of questions until you get to the right plant. For example: Is palm palmate? Yes or no. Does the palm have a two-foot or greater trunk? Yes or no. Does the palm have a crownshaft? Yes or no.<P>

   Depending on the answer, you then proceed to the next that will ultimately lead to the answer.<P>

   Small sketches accompany the key, so you can easily tell palmate leaf from a pinnate one, a reduplicate leaflet from an induplicate.<P>

   Then Stevenson deals with the history and culture of palms in South Florida, arranging them in groups according to leaf shape.<P>

   Among Stevenson's first instructions:<P>

   ``If you live in South Florida, go out and look around you, take this book along. No matter where you are, you should be able to see several different kinds of palms. . . .''<BR>
