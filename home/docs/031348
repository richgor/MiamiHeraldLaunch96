<m0>ou might say the futon is sleeping its way to the top.<ep>
   Strictly speaking, a futon is a thin cotton mattress derived from the traditional bedding of the Japanese. In America, it has evolved over the past three decades into a more casual version of the sofa bed.<ep>
   After gaining entry into this country through the '60s counterculture (--) its simplicity and portability made it a perfect fit (--) the futon is a product rocketing toward the mainstream.<ep>
   ``Probably the biggest negative about futons is the word `futon,' '' said Chet Stoler, a futonmaker who is past president of Futon Association International, a trade group.<ep>
   People confuse it with food, wondering if they should serve their futon with wasabi. Or they wander into a furniture store asking to try out one of those ``futtons'' or ``fultons.''<ep>
   ``You've got a product that the majority of people don't know what it is,'' said Dean Roland, co-owner of <m2><ql>

FUTON,  FROM  1H<ql>
<m0>Roland Futon, which has stores in Kent and Akron, Ohio.<ep>
   Yet people are learning.<ep>
   The futon is now used by all ages and economic groups, says David Bott, manager of New Dawn Futon & Furniture in South Miami.<ep>
   ``Buyers range in age from high school kids to parents buying them for younger children to grandparents who want them for the grandkids to sleep on when they visit,'' Bott said.<ep>
   Other futon buyers include newlyweds seeking affordable, multipurpose furniture, apartment dwellers who want the den to double as a guest room and young adults living at home who want their bedroom to look like a sitting room.<ep>
   How affordable? At Miami Futon Furniture, futon chairs that open into a single bed range from $150 to $175, and sofas with an oak frame cost up to $600.<ep>
   ``People associate futons with cheap furniture, but it's alternative furniture,'' said David Ivler, an owner of Miami Futon Furniture. ``The publicity has been on the cheap, affordable market. Down here it's looked on as disposable furniture, but in the Midwest, people are willing to pay up to $1,200 for a beautiful wood frame that can last a lifetime.''<ep>
<m1>Debunking the myths<ep>
<m0>   Roland has practically made it a mission to educate people about futons, not only what they are, but also how to make sure you buy a good one. The best place to learn about a futon is in a specialty store.<ep>
   (While some chains, especially on the West Coast, have expanded regionally, there are no national futon chains, although some national furniture retailers carry them.)<ep>
   The first myth Roland debunks is that futons are the sole possession of college dorm dwellers. Even with his store not far from Kent State University, he said college students comprise only 6 percent of his business.<ep>
   Both Roland and Stoler say the largest customer base is between ages 25 and 55 (--) people who remember futons from the '60s and want an alternative to traditional, formal furniture.<ep>
   ``More people are buying them for empty nesters, home offices, spare rooms,'' said Stoler, of Minneapolis.<ep>
   Here are some areas Roland says to focus on when you're shopping for a futon:<ep>
<m1>What's inside<ep>
<m0>   (box) <m0>The mattress.<m0> ``What's inside of the futon is the most important material of your purchase,'' Roland said. ``Your mattress is actually more important than your frame.''<ep>
   Cheap cotton filling will compact over time, Roland said. So consider not only the thickness of a mattress, but its weight, as well. Heavier mattresses will compress less over time. A good full-size cotton mattress with a foam core will weigh between 48 and 55 pounds.<ep>
   The composition is important, too. The mattress should contain 70 percent staple fiber (--) those are the long, durable fibers of cotton (--) mixed with smaller, fluffier fibers called lentil fibers. There also may be other materials mixed in (--) one company recycles plastic pop bottles and shreds them into fiber. The weight is the most important factor, though.<ep>
   Ask the dealer for a cutaway of the mattress so you can see what you're buying. There should be a foam core in the middle. Ask about the density of the core (--) the good ones range from 1.8 to 2.3. (The number refers to compression of foam in a testing lab. The higher the number, the less the foam will compress.)<ep>
   For people with back problems, the relative firmness of the futon mattress can help, Roland said. Some chiropractors, in fact, recommend futons for their patients.<ep>
<m1>Material issues<ep>
<m0>   (box) <m0>The frame.<m0> The first thing to look for is a hardwood frame (--) oak, ash and maple are the most common woods. The mattress should be supported by thick hardwood slats.<ep>
   Try out the mechanism that pulls the futon from a couch into a bed. It should work easily and efficiently.<ep>
   Roland said the wood in imported frames tends to be of lower quality than domestic ones, although their mechanisms are sometimes better.<ep>
   (box) <m0>The warranty.<m0> You should expect the futon to be protected for a minimum of five years, and the warranty, ideally, should be backed up by the dealer, rather than the manufacturer. You're more likely to get timely service that way.<ep>
   Because few manufacturers make both mattresses and frames, you are likely to get separate warranties on your mattress and frame.<ep>
<m1>Portability and flexibility<ep>
<m0>   Roland touts the futon as an alternative to the sofa bed. While it was introduced via youth culture, Roland chuckles when he tells stories of older customers who point out that the futon is just the younger cousin of the old davenport.<ep>
   The appeal of a futon is that its cover (--) hence its look (--) can be replaced for $100 or less. It's a lot more portable than a traditional sofa bed. A futon can be dismantled and fit into a car; sofa beds are notoriously immobile.<ep>
   ``A lot of times, you buy a house and the sofa bed comes with it,'' Roland said.<ep>
   ``I don't say this is the best sofa in the world; I don't say this is the best bed in the world. But this is the best sofa bed in the world.''<ql>
