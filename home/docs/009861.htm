Q.<BR>
<BR>

I want to invest in real estate. But buying rental houses is so expensive. I see mobile homes advertised at very reasonable prices. Do mobile homes make good realty investments?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Mobile homes depreciate, just as your car does. But most rental houses hold or appreciate in market value. That's why houses are usually good long-term investments.<P>

   The big advantage of mobile homes for investors is cash flow. I know several investors who earn excellent rental income from their mobile homes. It is often possible to buy repossessed mobile homes inexpensively and rent them at substantial monthly rents.<P>

   However, before purchasing be sure you have a space where you can put the rental mobile home. Also, you might want to consider eventually investing in one or more mobile home parks.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

About two years ago we sold our house to a nice young couple and carried back a $34,000 second mortgage. But a few months ago I noticed our monthly check was a money order rather than the buyer's personal check. Last month, we didn't receive any check so I drove over to the house to see what was happening. <P>

   To my surprise, I found the place looked like a wreck. Upon ringing the doorbell, I learned our ``nice young couple'' had sold the house to some investor who apparently rented to a bunch of hippies. I wrote to the new owner, who doesn't live in the house, but have not yet received a reply. What should I do?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Get out your promissory note and mortgage or deed of trust. Do they contain a due on sale clause? If so, you can call your note and demand payment in full because there has been a transfer of title without your approval. A local real estate attorney can handle the details.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

A few weeks ago you suggested to another reader that she hire a mortgage broker to obtain a mortgage on her unusual property. I just want you to know that advice worked for me, too. Due to credit problems, I was having trouble getting a mortgage to buy a home with just a 5 percent down payment. About two weeks after I filled out a loan application, my mortgage broker arranged a ``no cost'' mortgage for me at 8.75 percent interest. I realize that rate sounds high but it includes the loan costs. Why don't you recommend mortgage brokers more often?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

You are correct that mortgage brokers often obtain ``impossible'' mortgages for difficult properties and/ or borrowers. Mortgage brokers have the special advantage of being able to shop loan applications among dozens of lenders until they find one willing to make your loan.<P>

   However, a few mortgage brokers give the industry a bad name. To get loan applications, they sometimes promise prospective borrowers excellent loan terms. Then, just a few days before the scheduled closing date, the mortgage broker informs the borrower of less-desirable ``take it or leave it'' terms.<P>

   Unfortunately, this ``bait and switch'' tactic is not isolated. Borrowers who rely on mortgage brokers don't learn about it until it's too late. Probably 95 percent of mortgage brokers are honest and ethical. It's the other 5 percent who give the industry a bad name.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

When my wife and I were divorced about four years ago, the divorce decree said we would continue jointly owning a commercial property we owned. I manage it at no charge, earning excellent rents for both of us. Now my ex-wife wants to sell the property, as she is moving out of town with her new husband. <P>

   I explained I'll be happy to mail her checks wherever she designates. But she has hired an attorney who threatens to force a sale if I don't agree to buy my ex-wife out. Although I don't want to do so, I can refinance to raise the money. <P>

   The price she wants for her half is outrageously high. Can she force me to sell the property if I don't buy her out?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Yes. When one realty co-owner wants to sell but the other doesn't, the one desiring a sale can sue in a partition lawsuit. If the property cannot be physically divided, the court will usually order the property sold and the proceeds divided. Your attorney can give you information.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

In last week's newspaper I saw an ad for a home at a bargain price in a great neighborhood. I immediately phoned the realty agent with whom we had been working about two months. She was not yet aware of this new listing. Two hours later she phoned us back to report the listing agent refused to show the house before her 1 p.m. Sunday open house.<P>

   We were the first people to inspect the house at 1:05 p.m. on Sunday. It was perfect for our family. <P>

   The listing agent suggested writing up an offer on the spot. When we told her we were already working with another agent, she seemed disappointed. <P>

   About 1:30 p.m. we located our agent holding another open house on her own listing. Our agent immediately wrote up our offer, including a $5,000 earnest money deposit check. <P>

   About 5 p.m. our agent phoned to report someone else had bought the house that afternoon for the full asking price. Shouldn't our agent have been given an opportunity to present our offer?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Buying a bargain-priced house can often be very competitive. The listing agent naturally wanted to act as a dual agent representing seller and buyer so she could earn the full sales commission. If the listing agent knew about your offer, she should have informed her seller when it would be available.<P>

   Probably the buyer inspected the open house after you did and decided to make a purchase offer through the listing agent. There is nothing wrong with that, as long as all parties understand whom the agent represents. It appears the listing agent did nothing improper. <P>

   Keep looking. You'll probably find a house you like even better.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

I sold my home in May 1994 at a net profit of about $72,000. My plan was to build a new home on a lot I owned. But I had trouble getting construction financing, then I lost my job, and then my wife filed for divorce. <P>

   There is no way I can start and complete my home by May to defer my profit tax. When I called the IRS for a time extension, the agent acted like I was crazy. What is the procedure for getting a hardship extension?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

There is no way you can obtain a hardship extension of the 24-month period for tax deferral by buying and occupying a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost.<P>

   There were several recent U.S. Tax Court decisions stating Internal Revenue Code 1034 lacks any hardship extension criteria so even the courts cannot give you more time. For details, please consult your tax adviser.<BR>
