<m0>   HIGH POINT, N.C. (--) On Day 3 of the International Home Furnishings Market, the world's largest retail furniture expo, buyers hurrying between showroom buildings paused while the skies darkened and the temperature dropped. A funnel cloud that someone reported at the city limits never did touch down, but weather remained on everyone's mind.<ep>
   Retailers from the Northeast and Midwest arrived at the semiannual market after a disastrous winter of record snowfalls. Continued consumer caution and the rumble of higher interest rates did not improve their mood.<ep>
   Shipments of new furniture in the $48.7 billion industry were down 2 percent in the first two months of this year, the American Furniture Manufacturers Association said.<ep>
   This spring, it was a ``Waiting to Exhale'' market without clearly developed trends. The 2,300 showrooms generally displayed a kind of end-of-millennium nostalgia. A shift toward yellow-green and dark finishes evoked the 1940s, the '50s, the '60s and even the '70s.<ep>
   Mohair, tweed and chrome (--) the last used lavishly by Ralph Lauren in a $15,885 four-poster bed and an $8,265 trestle table for Henredon (--) threatened to return.<ep>
   Even ``Mediterranean,'' a word all but banned from the design lexicon for two decades, was back, most notably in Thomasville's 115-piece Renaissance Collection of ornate, large-scale furniture.<ep>
   Goods ordered at the April market will not appear in stores until the fall.<ep>
   Along with the color shift came a definite tilt toward Europe, away from Shaker, Mission and other American designs of the last few years. France was the country of choice. <m1><ep>
<m0>   ``This is European styling for the American market,'' said Tom Tilley, senior vice president of Century Furniture, which uses a robot to distress and add gouge marks and wormholes to the maple wood in its new Town and Country collection.<ep>
   Even contemporary style was spoken with a French accent. The Art Deco designer Jean-Michel Frank, who died in 1941, was the most famous trend-setter not in attendance. His angular work inspired the carriage-trade maker John Widdicomb as well as Mitchell Gold, whose customers include Pottery Barn.<ep>
   The droopy slipcovered look (Early Windstorm) was clearly on its way out. The freshest upholstered chairs and sofas looked tailored and taut, as though someone had put a skate key in the back of each and given it a few turns.<ep>
   Out, too, was rumpled washed linen and faded chintz: New fabrics often mixed cotton with a little rayon or polyester. Just enough for sheen; not enough to raise your barometric pressure.<ql>
