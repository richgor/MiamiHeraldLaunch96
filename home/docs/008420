<m0>   <m0>Carol Burnett, <m0>who returned recently to her leading role in the Broadway comedy <m0>Moon Over<m0> <m0>Buffalo<m0> and will perform for the first time at the Hollywood Bowl this summer, has listed her Los Angeles-area home at $2.6 million.<ep>
   Burnett completed her new home in Santa Fe, N.M., July 4 and lived in it for only two days before leaving for rehearsals in New York for the Broadway comedy <m0>Moon Over Buffalo. <m0>Since then, she has been in either New York or Los Angeles.<ep>
   Burnett, 63, will remain in her play, her first on Broadway in 30 years, through June. <m1>   <m0>She has lived in her Century City home for about three years, sources say. A couple of years ago, she sold a Honolulu home she had owned since the late 1980s.<ep>
   Her California home is a free-standing villa in a gated and guarded community. The 6,000-square-foot home has a courtyard entry with an outdoor fireplace and fountain, four bedrooms including maid's quarters; five baths, two powder rooms, a three-car garage and two parking spaces. The home also has an elevator.<ql>

<m0>   <m0>Roseanne, <m0>whose ABC sitcom was renewed for a ninth season and who is executive producer of the new Fox show Saturday Night Special, has sold one of the two houses in her Brentwood compound, listed in January. Roseanne, 42, and her husband, <m0>Ben Thomas, <m0>had a son last summer. She announced then that she didn't want to raise the child in Los Angeles.<ep>
   The larger of the two houses in Roseanne's compound is the one that sold. It has been described as ``a Tudor-Alpine chalet'' with six bedrooms and a guest house in 6,000 square feet. Listed first at $4.5 million, the house is said to have sold for closer to $3.5 million to a Wall Street dealmaker and his wife, who plan to live there.<ep>
   The second house, a 3,000-square-foot white brick residence, has been reduced from $3.2 million to $2.85 million.<ql>

<m0>   Hockey star <m0>Jari Kurri, <m0>traded in March by the Los Angeles Kings to the New York Rangers, and his wife, <m0>Tina, <m0>have put their Southern California home on the market at $850,000.<ep>
Kurri won five Stanley Cups in Edmonton and is the highest-scoring European forward in NHL history. He and his wife are from Finland.<ep>
   The Kurris, who have twin 10-year-old sons, bought their home in Calabasas five years ago when he was signed by the Kings. The 4,200-square-foot house is on a knoll at the end of a cul-de-sac in a gated development.<ep>
   The house, built in 1988, has five bedrooms, all with balconies. The master suite has a fireplace and a spa with a waterfall.<ql>
