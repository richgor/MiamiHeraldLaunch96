<m0>he trouble started on Page 16, where it said to loosen something called the ball-cock nut.<ep>
   I am installing what is essentially a $599 toilet seat, and the Pentagon had nothing to do with it. In fact, to the Japanese conglomerate that is selling it through kitchen and bath retailers and plumbing supply houses, it is not even a toilet seat, but a high-tech ``washlet.'' On its white plastic cover is a single word: the conglomerate's name, Toto.<ep>
   Clearly, we're not in Kansas anymore.<ep>
   This is an ergonomic toilet seat. Toto executives say it has been shaped and sized to keep bathroom readers' legs from falling asleep midway through <m0>War and Peace.<m0><ep>
   It has an automatic retractable spray nozzle that squirts heated water in the manner of a unisex bidet. (A hand-held remote control displays an image of a tiny seal juggling a beach ball when the nozzle is on.) It also has its own fan, which is activated by an infrared sensor.<ep>
   Alfred Maria Polczyk, the German-born engineer and architect Toto put in charge of developing washlets for sale outside Japan, <m1> <m0>has assured me that I can install it myself. My confidence is buoyed by this sentence on Page 14: ``A standard flat screwdriver, an adjustable wrench and the fastening tool included with the washlet are the only tools <m2><ql>

SEAT,  FROM  1H<ql>
<m0>needed for washlet installation.''<ep>
   I have already removed the old toilet seat and replaced it with the washlet, which is essentially a toilet seat attached to a unit that is about the size of a loaf of French bread and fits neatly into the otherwise empty space between the toilet seat and the tank. The washlet is held in place by two big plastic screws that fit through two holes already in the toilet.<ep>
   Next I twist the water-supply shut-off valve that is on the wall below the toilet. Only later do I learn that I have twisted it in the wrong direction, increasing the flow rather than shutting it off. A couple of steps later something snaps inside the tank and suddenly, water is spewing out. I decide I need help, and fast.<ep>
   An SOS brings the emergency plumbing squad, which consists of Julio and John, who work as handymen in my apartment building. They need three hours to finish installing the washlet and replace the $12 part from inside the toilet that I broke.<ep>
   They don't even bother to read the manual.<ep>
   ``It looks good on paper,'' Julio said, ``but if you don't know what you're doing, that's not going to do you any good.''<ep>
   John did not like the parts that came with the washlet. One washer broke, and he thought the water hose looked flimsy.<ql>
<m1>User-friendly<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Toto has christened this model of washlet Zoe, connoting that the washlet has a user-friendly personality. The instruction manual is called ``Owner's Manual for Zoe.''<ep>
   But Zoe is a stripped-down model. Toto, which says it sells 60,000 washlets a month in Japan, was selling only 60 a month in this country until Polczyk came along. He needed only one or two focus groups to realize he had to simplify the model Toto was selling, which had a dryer (for follow-up on the bidet feature).<ep>
   ``You have to sit there for three minutes,'' he said. Polczyk told Toto that Americans had no patience for that. So the dryer was eliminated. The company says it is now selling 500 Zoes a month.<ep>
   Polczyk got other ideas for innovations when Toto held a workshop on the sociology of the bathroom.<ep>
   ``Ninety people, and they had to use the product,'' he said. ``It was hilarious. First they were shocked. Then we couldn't stop them anymore. They told us every secret of their toilet life.''<ql>
<m1>A safe refuge<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Starting with how much time they spend in the bathroom. About 75 percent of the people Toto questioned said they go to the bathroom to avoid being disturbed by other members of their households.<ep>
   ``One woman said, `I take a pot of coffee and lock myself in,' '' Polczyk recalled.<ep>
   ``I said: `A pot? You mean a cup.' She said: `No, a pot. My husband has his den; I have my toilet.' ''<ep>
   Polczyk also recruited Ayse Birsel, a Turkish-born designer who teaches at the Parsons School of Design in Brooklyn, to adapt the washlet for the foreign market. She realized that it was the job she had been preparing for all her life.<ep>
   ``As a child,'' she said, ``I used to spend a lot of time cleaning the toilet in my parents' bathroom, just because I liked doing that. I think I had the fascination. You know, in the old days, how some hotels had an attendant? When my parents had guests, I would put a little dish in the bathroom with a sign that said `Thank You,' hoping someone would tip me.''<ep>
   Thanks to her, I won't have to worry about the circulation in my legs.<ql>

<m0>   ``If you spend a lot of time in the bathroom reading,'' said Naomi Uesaka, Toto's new-products marketing chief in America, ``you may have noticed that your legs go numb. That won't happen on this washlet. That part of the seat is not as high as a normal seat. Your behind is lower than it would normally be, so there won't be as much pressure on your leg and it won't obstruct your blood flow.''<ql>
