<H2>How to tell when drip is a leak</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   That dreaded drip, drip, drip is the sound of gallons of water being flushed down the toilet, not necessarily in the bathroom.<P>

   It sneaks out through tiny holes in service pipes, cracks in swimming pools and dozens of other places. It takes a toll on the environment as well as on the water bill.<P>

   Conserve Water/Detect-A-Leak-Week starts today and runs through Saturday. It's a good time to take stock of your water usage and look for signs that may signal a leak.<P>

   ``We estimate that one in every 20 private pools and one in every 318 private buildings have serious leaks,'' says Richard B. Rennick of American Leak Detection, a Palm Springs, Calif., company that sponsors the event.<P>

   Telltale signs of leaking water include:<P>

   <LI> Running toilets and dripping faucets.<P>

   <LI> Unusually high water bills.<P>

   <LI> Musty odors coming from floors or walls near drains or sewers.<P>

   <LI> Spongy, soft or discolored walls.<P>

   <LI> The sound of running water when nothing is turned on.<P>

   <LI> A water meter reading that changes when you aren't using any water. (You can test this by marking the indicator and not using any water for an hour.)<P>

   <LI> A cracked or unusually damp slab.<P>

   <LI> Warm spots on concrete slab floors, or mildew or excessive moisture under carpets.<P>

   <LI> Chronic sewer backup problems.<P>

   <LI> Areas in the yard that are unusually wet or moist, often with healthy or unusual plant or grass growth.<P>

   In pools and spas, look for:<P>

   <LI> Loss of 1/8-inch of water or more in 24 hours. To be sure it's not evaporation, place a bucket of pool water on your pool steps, leaving several inches of the bucket above water but making sure the water levels are roughly the same. Mark both levels, then wait 24 to 48 hours. If the pool loses more than the bucket, check for leaks.<P>

   <LI> Algae formation too soon after a chemical treatment.<P>

   <LI> Loose or falling tiles or pool deck cracks.<P>

   <LI> An automatic filler that is continually releasing water.<P>

   <LI> Cracks and gaps in the pool shell or concrete deck, or a settling of the whole pool or spa structure into the ground.<P>

      When it comes to saving water, it's often the little things that count.<P>

   Here are some water-saving tips to observe during Conserve Water/Detect-A-Leak-Week today through Saturday (May 5-11) and all year long.<P>

   <LI> Turn the water off while you brush your teeth; you'll save 3 gallons per brush.<P>

   <LI> Running only full loads in the washing machine and dishwasher can save 75 to 200 gallons per week.<P>

   <LI> It takes 30 to 40 gallons of water to fill a bathtub and 5 to 10 gallons of water per minute to take a shower. That means a shower will save water if you don't hog the hose.<P>

   <LI> Installing a flow restrictor in the shower will cut water use by as much as two-thirds.<P>

   <LI> Covering your swimming pool when it's not in use will prevent evaporation of as much as 1,300 gallons.<P>

   <LI> If you keep a bottle of water in the refrigerator for drinking, you don't have to run the tap until the water gets cold enough to drink. This saves 200 to 300 gallons per week.<P>

   <LI> To reduce water flow in toilets, install a plastic water bottle weighted down with pebbles in the tank, or switch to a low-flow toilet that cuts the amount of water used per flush from 5 to 10 gallons to 1.6 gallons or less. Don't be fooled by the old handyman's solution of installing a brick in the toilet tank; a brick can dissolve slightly, causing clogging problems.<BR>
