<m0>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>We have been told that our dog of eight years has Cushing's disease and that it has to do with his liver. Could you explain a little more about it?<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>Cushing's disease is a disease of the hormone or endocrine system. It has nothing to do with the liver; it affects the adrenal glands. It's a disease that cannot be cured, but with supportive treatment, your dog's life can be made more comfortable.<ep>
   If your veterinarian really said it was due to liver disease, you should get further clarification concerning treatment. If the explanation is unsatisfactory, seek another opinion.<ep>
   Many canine diseases of the endocrine systems are complex, and often more than one disease is present, leading to a general weakening of the animal's condition and increased susceptibility to infections.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>I've been a cat lover all my life and now I have three cats. One, Ebony, has a passion for water. She loves to lie on the wet shower floor and sometimes I find her in the sink, soaking her hind end, tail and legs under the dripping faucet.<ep>
   She also loves the smell of bleach. If I'm cleaning and she smells it, she comes running as if she's found catnip at the end of the rainbow.<ep>
   Are these strange behaviors for a cat?<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>Generally, it's unusual for cats to enjoy getting wet. But I have heard of a few that like to jump into the bath and splash around.<ep>
   Some wild relatives of the domestic cat, like the Asiatic fishing cat, are excellent swimmers. Also, tigers enjoy a regular dip, and better zoos provide them with a pool. In the wild, tigers will often drive prey to water, dive in and make their kill in deep water.<ep>
   Your cat's attraction to bleach is quite common. This and other household cleaners should be kept out of the way because some are poisonous. In the process of grooming themselves and licking their paws, cats can ingest harmful chemicals if they've made contact with them, especially after walking on treated floors and counters.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>My dog has had an allergy every spring and summer for the past two years. I have taken her to three veterinarians who have prescribed antihistamines and antibiotics, but nothing seems to help. She continues to lose her hair in spots.<ep>
   It starts with a small bump under her skin, which becomes a sore. The sore then forms a crust, which itches to the point that she will rub herself on any object.<ep>
   Do you have any suggestions for preventing this kind of rash?<ql>
<m1> <m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>This is a common canine problem. Allergies in dogs most often affect the skin. The first signs are usually itching and redness on the skin, and the sores swell. They then begin to weep serum and develop scabs.<ep>
   If these rashes are confined to the dog's feet and belly, a contact allergy is suspect. In that case, bathing the dog daily and keeping her off lawns and out of long grass should help.<ep>
   More diffuse skin eruptions can mean an inhalation allergy. Grass pollen is a common culprit. Again, keep the dog away from long grass and bathe your dog every three or four days to rinse out any pollen in its coat.<ep>
   An air ionizer that helps filter and purify the air in the house is also beneficial. Supplementing your dog's diet with a teaspoon of brewer's yeast and a tablespoon of vegetable oil will improve the skin condition.<ep>
   A combination of antihistamine and steroid pills is the best emergency medicine for acute skin allergy, but I would not advise oral antibiotics.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>When my 7-year-old dog was leaking urine, the vet said that since she was spayed, her body wasn't producing enough estrogen. He gave her some estrogen pills, which worked.<ep>
   The problem is that she'll have to take the pills for the rest of her life. Is there anything I can give her with estrogen in it so she won't have to take pills forever? Could the pills possibly give her cancer?<ql>
<m1> <m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>I assume your veterinarian has checked your dog for cystitis, and that the problem is purely post-spay estrogen deficiency, which is not uncommon.<ep>
   You are right to be concerned; estrogen supplementation is not without risk. Some forms of cancer, like cancer of the mammary glands, are estrogen-dependent. Another serious side effect can be anemia caused by bone-marrow suppression. For these reasons, medication must be carefully monitored.<ep>
   One of my dogs had the same problem. We put the dog on estrogen at intervals of two to three months, tapering off the dose to zero and giving more medicine when it became incontinent. My dog has been off medication and continent for two years. So you may be able to achieve this state of balance in your dog and not have to keep it on medication.<ql>
