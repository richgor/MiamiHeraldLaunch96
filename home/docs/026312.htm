We have some old furniture that we would like to refinish, but we want to avoid the painstaking process of stripping off the old paint. I've heard there are places that dip-strip wood. Can you steer me to one?<BR>
<BR>
I don't recommend dip-stripping old furniture. Dip-stripping might weaken joints, loosen veneer and cause poor adhesion of the new finish.<P>

   If you plan to repaint the old furniture, it is usually possible to paint over old paint. Just clean each piece thoroughly to remove wax and dirt, sand to remove gloss, and fill imperfections with wood putty. Apply a coat of primer, then repaint.<P>

   If you want a stain-and-varnish finish, I recommend removing the paint with one of the new ``safe'' strippers available at most paint stores and home centers. Work on a small piece first, to see if the wood under the paint is really attractive enough for a finish other than paint (if not, you can still prime and repaint). Carefully follow directions and cautions on the stripper container. I recommend wearing goggles and gloves when using any stripper, no matter how safe it is supposed to be.<BR>
<BR>
I want to install ceramic tile on a bathroom wall. Where can I get instructions?<BR>
<BR>
Some tile dealers, such as Color Tile, offer leaflets with instructions for installing ceramic tiles.<P>

   For more in-depth instructions, try a book such as Setting Tile,  by Michael Byrne ($19.95 paperback), which has just been published in an updated edition by Taunton Press. Setting Tile  is well illustrated and covers all aspects of tile work, including surface preparation and grouting. Three companion videotapes, Tiling Walls, Tiling Floors  and Tiling Countertops,  are also available.<BR>
<BR>
The walls of the first floor of our house are built of concrete blocks that are not insulated. The walls are plastered on the inside. How can I insulate these walls? I can't get at the top of the blocks to pour anything in the cavities.<BR>
<BR>
I know of no practical, cost-effective way to add insulation internally to concrete-block walls once the walls are finished and closed off. Some builders who use concrete blocks in new homes put foam insulation in the block cavities or pour granular insulation into the cavities during construction.<P>

   However, if you are convinced that the walls need insulation, there are a couple of options. If the house would benefit from new siding, rigid foam insulation can be installed on the outside of the walls and covered with vinyl, stucco or other new siding. If you prefer to refinish the inside of the exterior walls, rigid foam insulation can be installed on the inside and covered with gypsum wallboard.<P>

<BR>
We have a carpeted floor with no access from below. The floor squeaks badly in spots. How can I stop the squeaking without tearing up the carpet?<BR>
<BR>
The floors probably have some loose floorboards or subflooring. When walked on, the loose material moves, rubs against nails or other boards, and causes squeaking. The solution is to retighten the loose material. Retightening is much easier to do on a bare floor or a floor that has access from underneath.<P>

   However, the problem can sometimes be solved on carpeted floors by using a tool kit called Squeeeeek No More. The kit includes special flooring screws, an alignment and depth-control fixture for the screws, a power-screwdriver bit, and instructions.<P>

   Using the alignment fixture, screws are driven right through the carpet and pad and into the wood in areas where squeaking occurs. When a screw is driven to the correct depth, the alignment fixture is used to break off the screw head and part of the shank so the screw is embedded only in the wood. The carpet is then fluffed up and the screw is invisible.<P>

   A Squeeeeek No More kit with 50 screws costs about $30 and is available from these sources: O'Berry Enterprises, Crystal Lake, Ill. 60014 (800-459-8428), or Improvements, Hanover, Pa. 17333 (800-642-2112). Extra screws can be bought separately.<BR>
<BR>
The front door of our house is stained and varnished, but the sun shines all day on the doors, and the varnish keeps peeling off. We tried expensive marine varnish, but still have to have the doors revarnished every year. The painter doesn't have a solution. Do you?<BR>
<BR>
Marine varnish and spar varnish are more resistant to outdoor conditions than ordinary varnishes, but a couple of coats of even these tough varnishes often can't resist the effects of strong sunlight and moisture.<P>

   The sun's ultraviolet, or UV, rays are extremely damaging to most clear finishes, which have no pigment to screen out the rays. Marine varnishes and some other varnishes contain UV absorbers or blockers, but full sunlight is still extremely damaging.<P>

   Three or more coats of a varnish with UV blockers will sometimes form a film tough enough to resist peeling in full sun, but the expense and labor involved often make this impractical. Even if the varnish doesn't peel, the surface can become dull in a year or so and require sanding and recoating to maintain a good appearance.<P>

   Probably the most practical solution, if you want to keep the door varnished, is to erect an awning or overhang that will protect it from direct sun.<P>

   An alternative is to remove the varnish and paint the door.<BR>
<BR>
Several of the drywall nails in our walls have popped so the heads protrude. If driven back in, they soon pop again. How can this be repaired?<BR>
<BR>
Here's a method that usually works: Drive a new drywall nail -- or better, a drywall screw -- into the drywall about an inch above each popped nail. The nail heads, or screw heads, are driven so they make a slight dimple in the drywall surface, but not far enough to break the paper covering.<P>

   Remove the loose nails with pliers, or drive them back in again to the proper depth. Fill the dimples around the heads of the nails or screws with spackling compound or wallboard joint compound. Let the compound cure, and sand smooth. Touch up the repaired areas to match the rest of the wall.<P>

   Drywall screws are less likely to pop than nails because they get a better grip in the wood framing behind the drywall. The special screws, which have thin shanks and flat heads, are sold at most home centers.<P>
