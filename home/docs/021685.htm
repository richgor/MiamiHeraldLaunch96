UTOPIA3 -- Workers in Palm Beach County broke ground last month on the first ``New Urbanism'' development in South Florida. The development, designed by Andres Duany, covers about 3 square miles in Jupiter and will be home for 6,000 families. It will also have a campus of Florida Atlantic University. What will it be like to live there? Who can afford this one? Whoriskey. w/art<BR>
<BR>

STOVELOVE -- Here's a Mother's Day story: When it comes to loyalty and long-term relationships, Ellen Teagarden considers herself especially fortunate. Her Magic Chef stove has lasted more than 55 years, a longevity she attributes, in part, to dedicated scouring. Every Thanksgiving, her husband takes a picture of the stove, which, thanks to its nonrusting, nontarnishing white porcelain surface, never seems to age. ``I have such fond memories of that stove,'' says her daughter, Linda Porter. ``Fried okra always came out perfect.'' Wires, with color art.<BR>
w/REFRIGERATOR -- If you think the automatic ice-cube maker in your current refrigerator ranks right up there with the wheel, then what about an ice maker that lets you choose the consistency of that ice -- from crushed to cube -- with the turn of a knob? The enhancement is just one of many in response to the renewed popularity of the kitchen as a center of contemporary family life. Wires.<BR>
w/STOVENEW -- What's big, expensive and hot all over? Stoves, of course. And you can forget four burners and an oven these days. If it doesn't have halogen burners, two ovens and a stainless steel finish that glows like old money, it's as cold as yesterday's toast. Wires. w/art<BR>
w/GURU0512 -- Vacuum cleaners.<BR>
w/HARDERVACUUM -- Wires.<BR>
<BR>

HOUSEFIXUP -- The fact is, a house is a depreciating asset, which needs lots of expensive maintenance just to hold its value. Wires.<BR>
<BR>
HOME section, May 19, 1996<BR>
<BR>

PLANTINGTIME -- Landscaping small spaces, such as townhouses, zero-lot-line properties. Ga. list of small trees. w/illustration and/or art.<BR>
<BR>

SEARSCARDS -- Now come trading cards with Sears Craftsman tools on them. w/color art.
