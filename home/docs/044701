<m0>      I have always been a fan of products that can accomplish more than one task. That's why I like Bissell's new Little Green Deluxe. <m1><ep>
<m0>   It's a portable spot remover, upholstery cleaner and window cleaner in one easy-to-use package.<ep>
   This compact, AC-powered unit weighs 10 pounds and is about the size of a tackle box. It includes a shoulder strap that grants mobility while keeping both hands free.<ep>
   Unlike cleaners that require a hook-up to a faucet, this model is self-contained. Just mix a small amount of cleaning solution (upholstery, carpet or window) with hot tap water in the unit's 48-ounce bottle and place it inthe machine.<ep>
   The Little Green Deluxe produces a fine mist that penetrates stains while the unit extracts the dirt and suctions it into its 60-ounce holding tank.<ep>
   Bissell's Little Green Deluxe sells for $120. For information, call (800) 237-7691.<ql>

<m0>Turtle's not slow<ep>
<m0>   For bigger jobs, there's the small-but-powerful new Turtle from Singer. The Turtle features a tank-in-tank design that saves space while allowing for the separation of the cleaning solution and the dirty water.<m1><ep>
<m0>   The Turtle is powered by a 9.5-amp motor and includes two extension wands and a deep-cleaning accessory head. <m1> <ep>
<m0>   The Turtle (model No. WS3600) sells for $200.<ep>
   Also available is a $260 10.5-amp model that includes a pressure spray hose and a motorized scrubbing head. For more information about the Singer Turtle, call (800) 845-5020.<ql>
<m0>Big Wheel for adults<ep>
<m0>   Sharp's Big Wheel upright vacuum has 12 amps and features two oversize rear wheels to make rolling easier. An Edge Eater mechanism opens a front-mounted shutter that cleans all the way to the wall when vacuuming forward.<ep>
   Also included is a 14-inch beater bar and a telescoping wand for hard-to-reach places. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Sharp's Big Wheel vacuum (model No. EC-T4660) becomes available this month and sells for $230. For more information, call (800) BE-SHARP.<ql>
<m0>Almost a `riding' vacuum<ep>
<m0>   The truly lazy will appreciate Hoover's Self-Propelled DirtFINDER vacuum cleaner, which contains a device that senses whether you are pushing or pulling, then automatically propels the machine forward or backward.<ep>
   Other features include sensors to determine if dirt is traveling through the bags. A red or green light on the chassis tells you whether the area you are working on is dirty or clean.<ep>
   Hoover's Self-Propelled DirtFINDER Vacuum (Model No. U6331-930) sells for $500. For information, call (800) 944-9200.<ql>
