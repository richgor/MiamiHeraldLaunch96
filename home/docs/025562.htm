   HIGH POINT, N.C. -- Bless those baby boomers. They appreciate quality and are willing to pay for it.<P>

   So says Jerry Epperson, the furniture industry guru who gives a ``state of the economy'' talk to manufacturers at the International Home Furnishings Market every April.<P>

   ``The baby boomers [77 million Americans aged 32 to 50] have had all the kids they are going to have, but [the children] are still living at home,'' said Epperson of Mann, Armistead & Epperson, Richmond, Va. ``This means they are buying bigger houses and they are buying more furniture and better furniture.''<P>

   Bigger houses doesn't mean manufacturers should produce larger furniture, however.<P>

   ``Bigger houses mean more bedrooms,'' said Epperson. ``We're selling more beds and bedding.''<P>

   However, one room that is growing is the bathroom.<P>

   ``TV and exercise equipment are becoming standard for the master bath,'' Epperson said. ``Next thing you know we'll be entertaining in the bath.''<BR>
*  *  *<BR>
<P>

   <LI> Updated Retro look. One of designer Larry Laslo's new sofas for Directional's High Society collection is named South Beach -- for you-know-where. It is sleekly sculptural with a curving back that glides into low arms. Tightly upholstered in silk on all sides, it can float in the middle of a room. The sofa will retail for $2,399 and the matching ottoman, $729.<BR>
*  *  *<BR>
<P>

   <LI> Ottoman empire. There are lots of reasons to put your feet up these days. Ottomans, many of them with storage compartments, can be found in most furniture collections.<P>

   This handy piece of furniture also is growing, matching chairs and even sofas in width. The really big ottomans -- called ``table ottomans'' because they double as cocktail tables -- are five feet long in some cases. Just the place for an unexpected overnight guest.<BR>
*  *  *<BR>
<P>

   <LI> Neat ideas. Furniture designers may be credited for helping the slovenly get their act together. The designers are including velvet or felt-lined jewelry compartments in top drawers of bureaus and silver organizers in dining room pieces.<P>

   Many new desks and bureaus have hidden compartments to stash jewelry or cash.<BR>
*  *  *<BR>
<P>

   <LI> Novelty prints. La-Z-Boy introduced a recliner upholstered in rock 'n' roll-themed fabric in red, white and blue.<P>

   Thayer Coggin showed a berry patch pattern on a chair that looks like needlepoint from afar.<P>

   Drexel-Heritage displayed a topiary print on the skirt of an ottoman.<P>

   Several upholstery makers chose wild animal prints for occasional pieces such as small chairs.<BR>
*  *  *<BR>
<P>

   <LI> Less is not more. Sofas and chairs aren't wearing as much fringe or braid as they did a couple of seasons ago, but fancy is still ``in.'' Marge Carson, a manufacturer of contemporary furniture that's often oversized, introduced a sofa with 19 yards of braid outlining the frame.<P>

   Designers of leather seating have always used nail heads to secure the material. Now the nails -- as big as silver dollars in some cases -- are part of the trim.<P>

   ``Important'' buttons are also being used as trim, sometimes boldly marching down the back or along the skirt of a sofa.<BR>
