   HIGH POINT, N.C. -- You don't always have to leave home to experience exotic, faraway places.<P>

   And you don't have to surf the net for travel information, plug a movie in the VCR for an adventuresome escape, or even curl up with a good book to lounge on a tropical isle.<P>

   Little by little, ethnic designs are influencing home furnishings as consumers demand something different among designer-look interiors.<P>

   Nudging them along is a return to formality, bringing shiny textures, lacquered finishes and environmental tones of greens, reds and browns.<P>

   ``Ethnic has really changed in the last few years,'' said Michelle Lamb, a Minneapolis-based industry trend forecaster. ``What we've learned is that it will be a category that will continue to evolve, with not just Asian influences but Japanese, Thailand, West Indies, the Mediterranean.''<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   And, finally, African. Making a strong showing at the world's largest furniture market here last month were African-inspired furnishings and accessories. Burnished metals, leather upholstery and skin rugs dominated textures, while symbols from primitive cultures wove their way into designs, all in rich earth colors.<P>

   Manufacturers and retailers finally are waking up to a market void of those products, said Rita Troshynski, who helped coordinate a complete collection of such a line unveiled at the spring International Home Furnishings Market.<P>

   The Duma Collection by Heritage, a design company for African-themed products, features the work of 18 designers, including leather upholstered furniture, lighting, metal wall sculpture, glass tables, area rugs and decorative pillows.<P>

   The line targets middle to upper incomes, starting with affluent black consumers.<P>

   ``The long-held perception that blacks have little spending power has been responsible for the void in what's available to them,'' said Troshynski, citing research indicating African Americans spend $420 billion annually.<P>

   ``When Bill Cosby came out with the Huxtable family on TV, everyone said the show didn't reflect African Americans, when the truth has been there's much higher spending than most believe.''<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   But the Duma Collection, conceived by greeting card entrepreneur Reginald Powe, also hopes to feed the mainstream, middle-income appetites for something different.<P>

   And with sellers painting a gloomy market picture, ethnic furnishings got more second looks from the more than 70,000 buyers descending on High Point.<P>

   Many of the 2,300 exhibitors, attracting retailers and interior designers from 94 countries, were showing ethnic themes from around the world.<P>

   Eastern designs, reflected in Japanese porcelains and Chinese Chippendale furnishings, have long been mixed with other styles. But those of other countries, such as Korea, India and Indonesia, have never been as prevalent.<P>

   At the same time, experts such as Lamb, editor of The Trend Curve, a biannual industry newsletter, forecast a return to formality. ``We've gotten as casual as we can with furniture, so there's no place to go,'' she said.<P>

   Formality typically brings more shine, especially among silks and chintzes, Lamb said. High-lacquered finishes like those of chinoiserie, the gleaming furniture with intricate paintings of Eastern influences, are gaining strength, too.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   O.L.F. (Oriental Lacquer Furniture) was showing designer Ron Fleeger's Fantasy-East collection of metallic sheer silk pillows inspired by travels to India, Bhutan and Egypt.<P>

   At Past and Present, masculine teak cabinets from Indonesia featured intricate hand carvings. ``Some people are fascinated by the culture behind our pieces,'' said Mary Margaret Nevin of the Atlanta-based company. ``But others are attracted to it because it's different and new and fresh.''<P>

   Many innovative designs are springing from manufacturers using a variety of business partnerships to mine the diversity of craftsmanship within countries.<P>

   One is Hyundai Furniture Industries, which is not a manufacturer but a source for designers in foreign nations.<P>

   The company was emphasizing upscale looks with natural elements -- tooled pigskin leather, burnished metals, marble and limestone. New to this market were two dining rooms from Thailand, both made from clear rubberwood using new methods to promote conservation of rain forest trees.<P>

   ``It's a fascinating world out there,'' Hyundai spokeswoman Bonnie Peterson said. ``Interesting partnerships are being formed with Third World countries to make their products more viable.''<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   One arrangement to emerge among designers and manufacturers of ethnic furnishings is the Duma Collection, conceived 18 months ago by Powe, founder of Heritage Collection.<P>

   The company, which offers the largest assortment of African-themed cards, began by promoting black artists. Because African art is enjoyed not just for its beauty but also its rich symbolism, he saw the marketing potential.<P>

   ``Black people have been celebrating and teaching about love, family and spirituality for a long time,'' Powe said. ``I wanted to create a line of cards made specifically for all of us so that we could easily express our thoughts and feelings.''<P>

   A partnership with home furnishing and accessory designers, most of African descent, and U.S. manufacturers was a natural next step, Troshynski said.<P>

   Duma, which means ``cat'' in Swahili, targets upper-income consumers with designs licensed by 18 companies. But mainstream retailers, such as J.C. Penney, recognizing both the void of available products and the increase in black spending power, also are eyeing it, said Greg Schultz of Design South.<P>

   His company's offerings among the collection include a pencil-post bed, which sells for about $1,130, and an entertainment cabinet hand-painted with an African landscape, at $2,600.<P>

   A woven throw by Rug Barn, an Abbeville, S.C., manufacturer, features a cross design symbolizing strength and endurance.<P>

   All of the pieces, versatile enough to mix with other furniture styles, are sold with a card explaining their cultural significance, Troshynski said.<P>

   ``I think more than anything, though, people will buy them because of their beauty,'' she said. ``And for most, they are different.''
