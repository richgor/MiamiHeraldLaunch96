<m0>  Lesson No. 1 for beginning collectors of antique furniture starts with realizing that just about every style or period has been copied, faked and reproduced. This goes for finely carved English Chippendale as well as for French Provincial pieces with their simple charm.<ep>
   Blame it on fickle fashion, which creates a demand for a specific style. Prices go up for the authentic and even early reproductions. But not enough pieces can ever seem to be made to satisfy the demand.<ep>
   A case in point would be French Provincial pieces. The term refers to pieces made in the French provinces, such as Brittany, Burgundy and Gascony.<ep>
   It was designed for everyday use, unlike the pieces made in the cities for royalty. Even though the average French family and peasantry of the 17th Century acquired a degree of wealth, they still lived simply. Their furniture was made up of only essential pieces: a cupboard or hutch, closed bed and straw-bottomed stools. Extra pieces would be an armoire, cabinets and a variety of buffets.<ep>
   The wealthier provinces, like Burgundy and Gascony, adapted the styles of Louis XV. In many sections of the country the Louis XV style continued to be made to the end of the 19th Century. The Empire style was never used in the provinces.<ql>
<m0>Regional wood, fittings<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   French Provincial can be recognized by its cabriole leg and the carving, usually simple scallops. Depending on the region, it could be painted in a variety of colors and decorated with scenes as well as floral motifs. More common were the plain wood examples.<ep>
   Woods used were regional (--) oak in Normandy; walnut and fruitwoods in Lorraine; walnut in Savoie. Sometimes imported tropical woods were used in the Saintonge region.<ep>
   Different regions show influences of earlier heritages. Normandy, for instance, had Viking touches; Alsace can be recognized by Germanic or Swiss traces in painting.<ep>
   Even the types of hardware varied with the regions. Provence and Limousin used steel mounts as handles and hinges. Normandy had brass fittings. In Lorraine, polished steel was often part of the trim.<ql>
<m0>1960s `antiques'<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   French Provincial chests, sideboards and armoires were the most popular pieces. In fact, beginning in the 1960s the French Provincial look became trendy. Armoires were mass produced by American furniture makers. In quality and price they ranged from top of the line to budget-priced. Both painted and plain pieces were made.<ep>
    Many of these are coming to market and sold as antiques. The branded labels or tags have been removed and they are battle-scarred by now. If you don't know about early construction and saw marks, a beginner could be confused.<ep>
  The reproductions, popular in the 1930s, are more confusing, since they came from France and are made in the old way, sometimes with great skill. The good news is that when you find them at auction, they can cost only a couple of thousand dollars. And, they are made of good, solid wood.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>

<m0>My grandmother recently died. Among the things she bequeathed are a pair of cranberry vases. One has a boy, the other a girl, with a bird. The figures are white and raised. They are unusual. Are they of value?<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>From your description, you have what is called ``Mary Gregory'' glass. Originally made in the 19th Century, the white enamel gives a cameo effect. They are named after Mary Gregory, who worked at the Boston & Sandwich Glass Co., and designed them. Yours could be worth $500 for the pair.<ql>
