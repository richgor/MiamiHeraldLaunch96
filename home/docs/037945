<m0>   ``Puce'' is ``flea'' in French as well as one of the least-favorite colors.<ep>
   ``Puce,'' said Leatrice Eiseman, ``is the color of the underbelly of a flea. It's a liverish purple color.''<ep>
   Glad we asked.<ep>

<m0>   HIGH POINT, N.C. (--) You're not going to like this. Yellow green is coming back.<ep>
   ``It's the dreaded `A' word (--) avocado,'' said Leatrice Eiseman, color specialist who forecast the future for color during the International Home Furnishings Market last week. ``The big green now is yellow green.''<ep>
   That shade was not yet evident at the market, which featured earth tones and subdued greens such as sage and olive.<ep>
   Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute and head of the Eiseman Center for Color Information and Training, said green is ``so hot'' today because of global concern for the environment, ecology and preservation of nature.<ep>
   ``Consumers describe it as fresh, clean and revitalizing,'' said Eiseman. ``Green is especially favored by a demographic group called the `influentials.' These are the opinion leaders, the kind of people others go to for advice. They are the very vocal 10 percent of the population who embrace newness and spread the word. They are the trend setters.''<ep>
   While yellow green is generally disliked by adults, it is embraced by kids, who refer to it as ``slime green.''<ep>
   ``Why do they like it? Because their parents hate it,'' Eiseman said.<ep>
   All greens, however, rank second to blue, which is at the top of the color popularity chart with both men and women, according to the 1995 Pantone/Roper Consumer Color Preference Study.<ep>
   ``It comes as no surprise that Americans overwhelmingly chose the color that best evokes a soothing, calming tranquillity in a frantically fast-paced, often insecure world,'' Eiseman said.<ep>
   Purple came up as the third-favorite color in the study. ``This was a big surprise,'' Eiseman said. ``Purple is a bridge between warm and cool colors. Men are less negative about purple than they used to be. If the influentials like purple, we have to pay attention to it.''<ep>
   Red follows purple. ``The most secure people choose red.''<ep>
   Black is next, preferred more by women than men.<ep>
   Pink follows black, particularly a shade called ``cameo rose'' which is a beige with a slightly rosy cast.<ep>
   Both brown and yellow got high ratings from upper-income people. ``Yellow is considered the most cheerful, happiest color and is especially popular for kitchens,'' Eiseman said.<ep>
   As for beige, consumers ``are not passionate about beige, but it's safe.''<ep>
   ``There's a return to beige and brown when people are concerned about spending money,'' Eiseman said. ``As for white, people aren't passionate about it either. It's safe and simple.''<ep>
   Orange is the least-favorite color of the population as a whole, but favored by the ``influentials,'' partly because ``they are more secure in indulging in off-beat tastes and because orange has become a color embraced by haute couture.''<ql>
