<m0>ver visit a used-car lot? If so, you might have noticed that despite differences in price, mileage and mechanical condition, nearly all the cars had one thing in common: a new wax job.<ep>
   Used-car dealers know what sells cars: curb appeal.<ep>
   Used-house dealers know something about curb appeal, too. Real estate experts say sellers can maximize a home's value and minimize time on the market with relatively inexpensive steps.<ep>
   ``People get a feel about a house in the first few seconds,'' said Warren Cronacher, a professional engineer. ``It's either `Bingo!' and there's instant chemistry, or it's, `Oh, that's nice, now let's move on.' ''<ep>

TOUCHUPS,  FROM  1H<ql>
<m0>broker is doing a good job of matching buyers with sellers, then sellers can usually assume that the people coming up the walkway are looking for a house just like theirs in terms of style, size, price and location. They can also assume that the buyers have probably looked at other houses, perhaps many others, and that the buyers probably know property values in the area better than the local tax assessor does.<ep>
   The trick, then, is making the buyer say ``Bingo!''<ql>
<m1>Entrance is crucial<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0><ep>
   ``The front entrance is so, so important,'' Cronacher said. ``The way a buyer feels when they see the front entrance can make a dramatic difference about how they feel about the rest of the house.''<ep>
   At the very least, Cronacher said, sellers should paint the front door and ensure that it opens and closes easily and locks securely. And, he said, if no amount of paint will make an old door look good, replace it.<ep>
   In addition, Cronacher said, all windows should be ``squeaky clean,'' shrubs and bushes should be trimmed and cut low enough so they don't block the windows, the lawn should be mowed, and the porch should be clean and uncluttered.<ep>
   ``If the walkway leading to the house is in good condition, put in some flowers,'' he said. ``If it's not in good condition, put in a new walkway.''<ep>
   While replacing a door or a walkway may seem like an expensive way to spruce up a house, Cronacher said, such improvements will almost always make the house easier to sell.<ep>
   Janet A. Stoecker, a real estate broker at Coldwell Banker Sammis in Port Washington, N.Y., agreed. ``Eye appeal is everything,'' she said. ``And even little things matter.''<ep>
   For instance, she said, many homeowners keep their trash cans at the side of the house. ``You can probably see them from the front,'' she said. ``So move them.''<ql>
<m1>Clutter cuts appeal<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0><ep>
   The inside of the house, Stoecker said, should be ``light, bright and uncluttered.''<ep>
   ``The less clutter, the better,'' she said, adding that when she lists a house for sale, she will walk through the house with the seller and make recommendations aimed at making the house appear bigger and brighter.<ep>
   ``We might suggest that curtains be removed or changed to let in more light,'' Stoecker said. ``We might tell them to take their knickknacks off the shelves and to take as much as possible off the kitchen counters. We tell them to paint the walls white, paint everything white. We might even tell them to remove some furniture to make the rooms seem bigger.''<ep>
   Florence Lohen, Stoecker's partner, said that one of the most important things for sellers to remove from the house when buyers are coming is the sellers themselves.<ep>
   ``If at all possible, the seller should not be at home when the house is being shown,'' Lohen said. ``That gives the buyers more freedom to ask questions.''<ep>
   In addition, she said, it is not uncommon for buyers who are seriously interested in a house to discuss changes they would make if they were to live there. And while such discussions are considered positive signs by real estate brokers, they may not be perceived that way by the seller.<ep>
   ``The buyer might say, `I hate the wallpaper,' '' she said. ``And the seller might have shopped for three months to find it. Now, when a bid comes in from that buyer, all the seller remembers is that they were the people who hated the wallpaper.''<ql>

   Nathan Rosenhouse, a New Jersey lawyer who has co-written a book on buying and selling real estate, said that sellers should thoroughly clean any carpeting that can't be removed and make sure that there are no unpleasant odors. (The latter issue is more common than might be expected; people living in a house become accustomed to odors that others might find offensive. It pays to have a trustworthy and truthful friend or family member subject the house to a sniff test.)<ep>
   Rosenhouse added that if there are fixtures that will not be sold with the house (--) like an elaborate chandelier or gold-plated faucets (--) those items should be replaced before the house is shown to sellers so they do not become points of contention at a particularly delicate stage of contract negotiations.<ep>
   In most cases, he said, major improvements to a house (--) like new kitchens, bathrooms or roofs (--) rarely result in a dollar-for-dollar return to the seller. In fact, Rosenhouse said, buyers often prefer to receive a credit on the purchase price and make such improvements themselves.<ep>
   At the same time, sellers should keep in mind that kitchens and bathrooms typically attract significant attention.<ep>
   ``A dingy bathroom is a real turnoff,'' said Erik A. Kent, an interior designer in Manhasset, N.Y. At the very least, Kent said, sellers should clean or regrout any tile, install a new shower curtain and make sure toilet bowls, tubs and sinks are spotless.<ep>
   ``It might even pay to put in a new john,'' he said. ``You can pick up a new toilet for next to nothing.''<ep>
   Even installing a new vanity is not a major expense, he said, ``but it makes the whole room look new.''<ql>
<m1>Pre-listing inspection<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0><ep>
   The same goes for replacing old kitchen appliances, Kent said. ``It is not all that expensive to replace a stove, or a dishwasher or a sink basin,'' he said. ``You don't lose on these things, and they make the house look a lot more appealing.''<ep>
   Most experts mention that while it is important for sellers to be aware of the positive aspects of their property, they should also be aware of any problems. Accordingly, increasing numbers of sellers are hiring home inspection companies or engineers to inspect the house to anticipate and address problems the buyer's inspection will undoubtedly reveal.<ep>
   ``Sellers aren't exactly thrilled when they get a critical report,'' said Cronacher, the professional engineer. ``But at least they're going to have the same information the buyers will have from their inspection. And when you're playing poker, it's always nice to have your adversary sitting in front of a mirror.''<ql>
