   Spring has sprung, and perhaps it's time for a new mower. In order to stay a cut above the rest, here's a sampling of some of the latest outdoor power equipment.<P>

   The Ryobi Mulchinator may be the most environment- and neighbor-friendly lawn mower on the market.<P>

   This battery-operated, walk-behind model features a 24-volt rechargeable battery that operates for 90 minutes on an overnight charge.<P>

   And because it is battery-operated, the Mulchinator is quiet and exhaust-free. And it's a back-saver as well, starting with the flick of a switch (security key required) as opposed to the pull of a cord.<P>

   Designed for yards of up to one acre, the unit's blade spins fast enough so that it not only cuts your lawn, it mulches the clippings into a chopped natural fertilizer that eliminates the need to bag and dispose of your clippings.<P>

   This bright yellow mower, which cuts an 18-inch path, sells for $350. A self-propelled Mulchinator that lasts for 75 minutes on an overnight charge sells for $450.<P>

   For information, call (800) 345-8746.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   If you're in the market for a new riding mower, check out the Ultra from Murray Lawn Tractor.<P>

   This 15.5-horsepower mower features a unique Hydrostatic Automatic Drive that allows you to control both forward and reverse motion with your right foot on a specially designed pedal. No shifting or clutching is required.<P>

   The mower cuts a 42-inch path and includes a maintenance-free battery. Available accessories include a bagger, mulcher, snow blade and snow thrower.<P>

   Murray's Ultra riding mower (model No. 4291) sells for $1,200. For information, call (800) 226-4392.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   If you want to shape your shrubbery without straining your shoulder, try the new battery-powered hedge clipper from Echo.<P>

   Powered by an environment-friendly 12-volt battery concealed inside a cushioned backpack, this 30-inch long, single-sided clipper operates for 5 1/2 hours on an overnight charge.<P>

   And because you wear the battery pack on your back, the clipper feels lighter (7.2 pounds as opposed to an average 14 pounds for a similar, gas-powered unit). It is also easier to handle, resulting in less fatigue.<P>

   Echo's rechargeable-battery hedge clipper, Model No. DHC-3000, sells for $400. For information, call (800) 432-3246.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   If you've ever owned a string trimmer, you've probably spent as much time banging its head on a hard surface to release fresh line as you've spent actually edging or trimming your weeds.<P>

   Solving this dilemma is Black & Decker's new Electric Weed Trimmer, model No. ST9000, which features a Touch Feed line system that automatically advances the line with the push of a handle-mounted button.<P>

   The unit also includes an edge-guide plate that connects to the trimmer base to make edging around sidewalks, driveways and flower beds more precise.<P>

   The Black & Decker Electric string trimmer is powered by a 4.3-amp electric motor (extension cord required) and sells for $60. For information, call (800) 544-6986.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   For bigger jobs, try Poulan Weed Eater's new Twist 'N' Edge Ultra Trim -- a two-cycle, gas-powered string trimmer.<P>

   The Ultra Trim features a 180-degree twisting shaft that converts the unit from a trimmer to an edger in one easy rotation.<P>

   Poulan Weed Eater's Twist 'N' Edge Ultra Trim sells for $140. For information, call (800) 554-6723.<BR>
