<m0>   HIGH POINT, N.C. (--) Bless those baby boomers. They appreciate quality and are willing to pay for it.<ep>
   So says Jerry Epperson, the furniture industry guru who gives a ``state of the economy'' talk to manufacturers at the International Home Furnishings Market every April.<ep>
   ``The baby boomers [77 million Americans aged 32 to 50] have had all the kids they are going to have, but <m1> <m0>[the children] are still living at home,'' said Epperson of Mann, Armistead & Epperson, Richmond, Va. ``This means they are buying bigger houses and they are buying more furniture and better furniture.''<ep>
   Bigger houses doesn't mean manufacturers should produce larger furniture, however.<ep>
   ``Bigger houses mean more bedrooms,'' said Epperson. ``We're selling more beds and bedding.''<ep>
   However, one room that is growing is the bathroom.<ep>
   ``TV and exercise equipment are becoming standard for the master bath,'' Epperson said. ``Next thing you know we'll be entertaining in the bath.''<ql>

<m0>   (box) <m0>Updated Retro look. <m0>One of designer Larry Laslo's new sofas for Directional's High Society collection is named South Beach (--) for you-know-where. It is sleekly sculptural with a curving back that glides into low arms. Tightly upholstered in silk on all sides, it can float in the middle of a room. The sofa will retail for $2,399 and the matching ottoman, $729.<ql>

<m0>   (box) <m0>Ottoman empire.<m0> There are lots of reasons to put your feet up these days. Ottomans, many of them with storage compartments, can be found in most furniture collections.<ep>
   This handy piece of furniture also is growing, matching chairs and even sofas in width. The really big ottomans (--) called ``table ottomans'' because they double as cocktail tables (--) are five feet long in some cases. Just the place for an unexpected overnight guest.<ql>

<m0>   (box) <m0>Neat ideas.<m0> Furniture designers may be credited for helping the slovenly get their act together. The designers are including velvet or felt-lined jewelry compartments in top drawers of bureaus and silver organizers in dining room pieces.<ep>
   Many new desks and bureaus have hidden compartments to stash jewelry or cash.<ql>

   Thayer Coggin showed a berry patch pattern on a chair that looks like needlepoint from afar.<ep>
   Drexel-Heritage displayed a topiary print on the skirt of an ottoman.<ep>
   Several upholstery makers chose wild animal prints for occasional pieces such as small chairs.<ql>

<m0>   (box) <m0>Less is not more.<m0> Sofas and chairs aren't wearing as much fringe or braid as they did a couple of seasons ago, but fancy is still ``in.'' Marge Carson, a manufacturer of contemporary furniture that's often oversized, introduced a sofa with 19 yards of braid outlining the frame.<ep>
   Designers of leather seating have always used nail heads to secure the material. Now the nails (--) as big as silver dollars in some cases (--) are part of the trim.<ep>
   ``Important'' buttons are also being used as trim, sometimes boldly marching down the back or along the skirt of a sofa.<ql>
