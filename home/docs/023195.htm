I read that the Bureau of Condominium is overwhelmed by complaints. Does this mean people are waking up to the abuses committed by these literal fiefdoms?<P>

  Our board runs roughshod over our members with its failure to post notices of meetings (how many times have you addressed this problem?); failure to address petitions; failure to record important decisions in the minutes, etc.<P>

   Would it be wiser to hire a lawyer and sue the board directly, or try our luck with the bureau?<BR>
A.S.,Tavernier<BR>
<BR>
Neither. If the folks you elected to run your neighborhood democracy are not doing the job properly and will not change, then you should put your efforts into electing new directors.<P>

   If you feel the electorate is not educated enough, or does not care enough about correcting the operations, get together with those who do, write a monthly newsletter and hold meetings using local experts to talk to your group.<P>

   A lawsuit may punish someone, but will leave a divided, uncomfortable community. A condo population that cannot correct its internal problems and clean its own house without resorting to lawsuits and court actions does not understand that condos are more than just housing units, and may not be ready to work for the common good.<BR>
<BR>
I live in a new condo and the bylaws say, ``no recreational vehicles.'' I have two parking spaces and one car, but I am interested in purchasing a 23-foot recreational vehicle. Is it possible for the board to change that bylaw?<BR>
J.Y., Plantation<BR>
<BR>
No. A bylaw can only be amended by a vote of the entire membership in the numbers set forth in your bylaws. In rare instances, the bylaws do give the board the power, but rarely.<BR>
<BR>
Recently our condo elected a new board of directors. At the organizational meeting, the new board members elected from among themselves the officers for the coming year.<P>

   One man was nominated by the president to be treasurer, and the rest of the board voted yes. Later he was called and told he was not going to be the treasurer. Is that legal? Also, the new board was sworn in by a person who is not a notary public. Is that legal?<BR>
L., Miami<BR>
<BR>
I can't help you without knowing why the board changed its mind. There could be valid reasons why the board reconsidered its actions. At the next meeting, the board owes it to the membership to openly explain why a mistake was made and say that the nomination process for treasurer is being repeated. But, even if there was no mistake, and the fiasco was just the result of political pressure, the majority of the board still has the power to vote out one officer and vote another in his place.<P>

  I have never heard of, or witnessed, a condo board swearing-in ceremony. It is not a bad idea, though, and I would be interested to know what they swear to. It is not called for by statute, so I don't think the validity of your officer selections hinges upon it.<BR>
<BR>
A year after we have taken over our responsibilities and fiscal accountability, we have yet to receive an official balance sheet from the board of directors, even though it has had an outside audit of the association's records.<BR>
R.W., Lakeland<BR>
<BR>
All types of community associations are required to prepare an annual financial report within 60 days of the close of the fiscal year. A few days after that, the association must make available a copy of the report to each member of the association. So, the first year the process could take a little more than 14 months. And, of course, the entire audit, including all supporting information, is open for review or copying by any association member.<BR>
<BR>
In my townhouse community we have a boat storage yard as one of the amenities. For years it has been available to any unit owner for a $10 key deposit. Now, the board has decided to start charging $120 a year to keep a boat in the yard. Can they do this?<BR>
Anonymous, Florida<BR>
<BR>
If the ``boat yard'' is a common element available for any unit owner to use, and your governing documents do not give the board the right to charge a fee to use it, they can't. If they are given the authority to charge a fee, they probably have the right to change the amount.<P>

  Unlike boat docks and seawall marinas, where rental fees might be increased because of necessary maintenance that benefit only the users, your storage yard probably only needs a new fence every five years. If a use fee were to be charged, I would think $20 per year for cleanup and fence repair would be more appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
When can the board of an association hold a work session without notifying all the condo owners?<BR>
Anonymous, Florida<BR>
<BR>
Essentially, never. Condos are a pure form of democracy, where elected officials are voted upon directly by their neighbors and friends. The directors then set the rules for, and control the assets of, the neighborhood.<P>

   It may be representative government, but it is more like the old New England Town Hall type, where every resident was in on all the decision-making. The law is explicit in insisting that any time a quorum of the board talks together, in any form, about the business of the community (not just make decisions), the entire populace is to get 48 hours' notice and has the right to sit in and know totally about what is going on.<P>

   Many condos have a standard meeting notice posted on their bulletin boards stating the set date for the agenda (or workshop) meeting as well as the set date for the regular monthly (or quarterly) business meeting.<BR>
<BR>
