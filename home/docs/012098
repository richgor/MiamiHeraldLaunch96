<m0>  Crotons were the first love of B. Frank Brown, a retired Brevard County school superintendent who has developed a four-acre botanical garden in Melbourne.<ep>
  Brown's recent romances have been with aglaonemas and ti plants, and it is the ti that is the subject of his latest book, <m0>The Cordyline, King of Tropical Plants.<m0><ep>
  In the agave family, ti plants (pronounced tea, not tie) grow as slender woody stems topped with feather-like clusters of bright leaves. Some of the leaves are narrow and long, others are broad and short. And miniature ti plants were developed in the 1950s in Hawaii, Brown said.<ep>
  In Hawaii, gardens everywhere feature tis. Some are used as a hedge to mark off the perimeter of the yard (to ward off evil spirits, according to <m0>In Gardens of Hawaii <m0>by Marie Neal), others are massed together. <ep>
   ``I've seen whole yards planted in nothing but ti plants,'' Brown said. ``The Polynesians who came to Hawaii in their long boats brought green ti plants, and wore leaves around their neck as a symbol of power.<ep>
  ``They're just marvelous landscape plants, but if you aren't careful, they can be garish.''<ep>
  Brown advises against using tis in rows; rather, they should be placed ``haphazardly'' all around the garden.<ep>
  The colors can be peacock bright, and two or three tis of the same type can have a dramatic effect.<ep>
  Brown said the large-leafed Kilimanjaro, a wide-leaf cultivar that has older green leaves edged in red surrounding new leaves of red, green and white, is one of the best for Florida.<ep>
  The plants play continuous variations on the theme of light or brightly colored leaves surrounded by darker leaves. Some of their names are perfectly descriptive: Red Edge, Rooster Tail, Magnolia, Tricolor, Little Rose, Lemon and Lime, Pink Diamond.<ep>
  The latter is what Brown calls ``the best of the cordylines'' because it is ``not garish'' but develops long green leaves edged in cream on bright pink leaf stalks.<ep>
  Brown, 78, was in the Philippines three weeks ago collecting aglaonemas, a low-growing rain forest plant with leaves patterned in shades of green, silver and cream. His collecting has resulted in his Valkaria Gardens, which is open to the public without charge on the first two weekends of June, July, August and September. ``We have the largest collection of tropical plants in Central Florida,'' he said.<ql>
