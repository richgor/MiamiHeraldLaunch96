<m0>    To maximize your chances of getting a good home inspection, hire the best inspector you can find. Your real estate agent can recommend inspectors, and they are listed in the yellow pages. But, don't hire an inspector without checking references.<ep>
   Ask friends for recommendations. <m1>    <m0>Interview inspectors. Find out how long the inspector has been inspecting homes in the area. Out-of-area inspectors may not be familiar with local conditions.<ep>
    Find out how many inspections each does in a year. A good, active inspector will inspect at least 200 a year. Make sure the inspectors work full-time doing home inspections and that they are not also in the business of contracting to fix defects uncovered during an inspection.<ql>
<m1>Point of reference<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The American Society of Home Inspectors is a trade association for home inspectors. Membership in the group does not guarantee that you will get a good inspection, but an inspector who is a member in good standing is likely to exhibit a level of professionalism that might not exist with a nonmember inspector.<ep>
    Ask each inspector to describe the scope of the inspection. An inspector should complete a thorough examination of all the major home components and systems: roof, attic, foundation, basement, garage, drainage, electrical, plumbing, heating and cooling systems, walls, floors, fireplaces and chimneys, windows, and doors. But, some inspectors don't check roofs; others won't check the drainage system. Make sure you'll get the kind of inspection you need.<ep>
    Find out what the inspector charges, but don't base your final decision solely on the fee. This is one area where you don't want to skimp. Also, make sure that your inspector has errors and omissions insurance that covers home inspections.<ql>
<m1>Attendance important<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Let your inspector know that you will attend the inspection. This is a must. Plan on devoting several hours to the endeavor.<ep>
    Attending the inspection allows you the opportunity to ask the inspector about defects. Also, the inspector will be able to educate you about good home maintenance.<ep>
    People who are buying long distance may have difficulty attending inspections. If it's impossible, try to find a friend or relative who can attend and give you a detailed report. Ask him or her, or your real estate agent, to tape record the inspection. Call the inspector directly if you have any questions, or to ask for a recap of the inspection.<ep>
    Your home inspection should be scheduled during the day, and the utilities should be on.<ql>
