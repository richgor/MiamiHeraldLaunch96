<m0>   StarSight is the name of a comprehensive program guide that can be displayed on your TV screen at the touch of a button (--) if you have a TV, VCR or stand-alone set-top box with StarSight circuits. The fee for this service varies from area to area.<ep>
   Just touch a ``guide'' button on the remote control, and seven days of listings are accessible. For a given listing, press the ``info'' button, and the channel number and call letters are displayed, along with the name of the program and how much time remains. Hit ``info'' again and a capsule summary of the show appears, along with details (stereo, closed-captioned, etc.) and rating.<ep>
You can search for programs by genre (movies, sports, comedies, specials, dramas, etc.) by pressing the ``theme'' button.<ep>
   A VCR with StarSight programming allows you to highlight a listing on the screen, and hit the ``record'' button to automatically program your VCR.<ep>
   Here are three of the latest VCRs with built-in StarSight. They all have four heads, hi-fi sound, MTS broadcast-stereo tuner, cable-box control and automatic clock set.<ql>
<m1>Goldstar GVR-E469<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Setup of the GVR-E469 ($549.95) is fairly easy. The see-through, gray plastic door that hides the VCR's controls is attractive, but must be opened to perform any operation and makes seeing the small fluorescent display difficult. The remote control has a clean design.<ep>
   The picture quality is very good to excellent, with solid freeze-frames and little ``noise'' in scan modes. The MTS/hi-fi sound system delivered good separation and frequency response. For performance and value, I give the Goldstar GVR-E469 three stars out of a possible five.<ql>
<m1>Samsung VR8905<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The VR8905 ($549.95), which includes a closed-caption decoder, has a front panel with a clean, functional look. Two flip-down panels hide seldom-used buttons and A/V inputs for a camcorder. The fluorescent display is larger and easier to read than those found on most VCRs.<ep>
   The unit is simple to set up and use. Front-panel and remote-control buttons are well-placed and logical; seldom-used buttons are hidden behind a hinged door. <m1><ep>
<m0>   The audio and video performance met or exceeded my expectations for VHS VCRs. Still-frames, frame advances and scans are clear and sharp. I give the Samsung VR8905 four stars (out of five) when compared to similarly priced VCRs.<ql>
<m1>Sony SLV-980HF<ep>
<m0>   The SLV-980HF, at $699, is at the top of the price range for this category of VCR. <m1><ep>
<m0>   The unit's styling includes a flip-down panel that hides the videocassette slot. The back of the panel holds a few buttons that would otherwise be located in plain view (--) channel up/down, input, tape speed and quick-timer. A small door below the camouflage panel hides access to a set of front-panel A/V inputs, for quick connection of a camcorder, and an ``easy setup'' button.<ep>
   The unit's face holds buttons for power cassette eject, pause and record. The most prominent control is the multifunction transport control (--) a large, round dial that can be rotated left for reverse tape movement and right for forward movement, while its center holds the ``play'' and ``stop'' buttons.<ep>
   The cassette slot panel was a nuisance. And, the remote (with the exception of play/stop/fast forward/rewind control) is not easy to operate in a darkened room because of its tiny buttons.<ep>
   This is a top performer and delivers first-rate picture and sound. At standard-play speed, still-frames are steady and slow-motion is free of noise bars. The MTS/hi-fi stereo sound system delivers good separation and frequency response. I give it four stars for its price range.<ql>
