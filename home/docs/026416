<m0>This upholstered settee, with the gilt, carved swag and arms was given to us. Everyone asks if it is an antique. What is your opinion?<ql>
<m0>R.K.,<m0> Miami Beach<qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m1>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>Alas! Nobody can tell whether a piece is an antique or not from a photo. It has to be seen in a professional appraisal. However, while its cabriole legs and fine gilt carving are in the style of 18th Century French Louis XVI, I am more inclined to think it could have been made in the early 19th Century, as part of the Neo-Roccoco revival.<ql>

<m0>I have been collecting little green ceramic pots. They are six-sided and have floral/ plant designs on each side. They are 4 inches high. What can you tell me?<ql>
<m0>S.T.S., <m0>Miami<qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m1>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>They are Chinese, of recent make and sold filled with pickled ginger or other relishes.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m1>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>This brass and Wedgwood chandelier is black with white designs. I had it converted to electricity. Could it have been an exhibition piece? What can you tell me about it? Is black rare?<ql>
<m0>A.W.,<m0> Pompano Beach<qr>

<ql>
<m0>Your mid 19th Century Wedgwood with black basalt and figures in white relief could have been made for the Crystal Palace Exhibition, London, 1851, based on the style of the brass gas light jets and the type of decoration. Not only is the use of black jasper one of the rarer colors, but the use of it in a candelabra is rare, too.<ep>
   For information send a photo to the Wedgwood Society, The Roman Villa, Rockbourne, Fordingbridge Hunts SP6 3PG, England.<ql>

<ql>
<m1>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>Can you provide any information on the floral embroidery in the photo? It is silk thread on silk material, signed and dated 1745.<ql>

<m0>Your wonderful embroidery was probably made in Essex County, Mass. However, it should be examined by a textile expert. It could sell at auction for $700 to $2,000.<ql>

<m1>Q.<ql>

<ql>
<m0>I have a Venison porcelain ``game set'' that belonged to actress Lillian Russell. We bought it from her estate. I would like to sell it. How do I do it?<ql>
<m0>D.S.,<m0> Hollywood<qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m1>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>Unless you have proof that it belonged to Lillian Russell, it would sell as just a Victorian game set. If you do have proof, you might contact Sotheby's auction house in Coral Gables.<ql>
<m2><ql>

<m1>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>I have more than 200 ashtrays in my worldwide collection. Who might be interested?<ql>
<m0>M.F.,<m0> Bay Harbor Islands<qr>

<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>Your best bet is to run an ad. Price them as a collection. Otherwise, buyers will siphon off the best, leaving you with the least valuable. Use a post office box number to screen the replies.<ql>

<ql>
<m1>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>Do I have a treasure? My four white soup plates have a deep cobalt blue rim, gold edging and floral design. They are marked ``Royal Staffordshire Pottery, Burslem, England.'' And ``Peking.''<ql>
<m0>J.A.M.,<m0> Miami Beach<qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m1>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>Treasures are in the heart of the holder. Your soup plates date after 1870. ``Peking'' is the name of the pattern. They could sell for $50 each in a shop.<ql>
