   For some people, prints of animals, birds and plants are a serious investment. For others, they are colorful ways to decorate a wall. Like other art forms, works by John James Audubon and other famous artists have been reproduced many times. The Audubon bird and animal prints, in early published editions, sell for thousands of dollars.<P>

   Less expensive, depending on where you find them, are botanical or floral prints. They became so popular in the 1920s and '30s that reproductions were sold even at Woolworth's, for a couple of dollars. They were printed in great quantities and many are still around at budget prices. Find them at garage sales and flea markets.<P>

   The first printings that were done in the 19th Century were hand-colored. By the end of the century, they were lithographed in color. Since then, restrikes have been made. The early 20th-Century restrikes can be identified with a strong magnifying glass or jeweler's loupe. They will show an overall pattern of tiny dots. However, since the 1970s, photographic prints are close to impossible to tell. Hand-colored prints will be very slightly raised and have a bit of a texture.<P>

   If you are offered a chance to buy authentic, old prints by a name artist, such as Audubon, at an unrealistic low price, be sure you buy them out of the frames. Prints that have been trimmed to fit a too-small frame are worth less.<P>

   Another no-no, which you can find only if the picture is examined out of the frame, is the ``laid-down'' print. This will be pasted directly on a backing material without hinging.<P>

   Sometimes it makes sense to buy a print by a famous artist, even if it has damage. It depends on what type of damage. Foxing -- brown or pale patches of discoloration or stains -- can be treated by a professional restorer. Losses, such as tears, punctures and pin holes, are more costly to repair. Only if you have a print worth thousands of dollars would this type of restoration be worthwhile.<P>

   The date of an old print can be ascertained by the name of the publisher or engraver. That's another reason to examine the print out of the frame: Restrikes will have a copyright date, skillfully hidden under the frame. It could be 1996.<P>

   Old prints will have a water mark. This is a translucent identifying mark made during the manufacture of the paper. The watermark may be a crown, monogram or company name, and is further proof of the print's age.<P>

   Among the most valuable prints are those that are in their original portfolio. This is the case or folder and the set of prints that are part of the complete set. These portfolios were popular with collectors in the 19th Century, and many were produced. Incomplete folios can still be found at estate sales. Prices depend on the appeal of the remaining prints.<BR>

Q.<BR>
<BR>

How can I get information and find the value of a brick-color clay oil lamp from the Roman era?<BR>
C.L.C., Hollywood<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Since such items have been faked for a couple of centuries, you need to have it authenticated by an expert. The only way to do that is to take it to a museum curator of Roman antiquities. Once authenticity is confirmed, you'll need an appraiser who is familiar with such items. Contact one of the Miami appraisal societies for advice.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

I have a pewter tankard that is engraved, ``Finest English Pewter, Craftsman Made, Sheffield, England.'' The outside is engraved with the faces, names and dates of British rulers, beginning with William 1 and ending with Elizabeth II. Can you tell me the value?<BR>
M.H., Coconut Creek<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Your souvenir tankard could be worth between $50 and $70.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

I have a figural Moorish-motif grouping that is made of bronze, mosaic and painted. Where are they from? What are they worth? One is marked Nissel & Sikora, Wien-1.<BR>
S.B., Miami<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Your cold-painted bronze grouping was made in Vienna around the turn of the century. It could sell at auction for several thousand dollars.<BR>
