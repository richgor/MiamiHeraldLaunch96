M.F., Lantana<BR>
<BR>
Living to see your house paid off is not the issue here -- it's the massive amount of extra interest you'll pay if you go with a 40-year loan.<P>

 Some lenders are touting the 40-year mortgage as one way to increase your borrowing power, since your monthly payments would be lower. But the only thing that's really being increased is the lender's profit.<P>

   Let's look at the numbers. The principal and interest payment for $80,000 at 8 percent on a 30-year loan would be $587.02 per month. This is $30.77 per month more than the 40-year loan at $556.25 per month.<P>

   While qualifying for the lesser payment would help you purchase more house, it could end up costing you $55,673 more over the life of the loan. (That is, 480 payments totaling $267,000, compared with 360 payments totaling $211,327.)<P>

   This might not be such a concern if you were going to be moving again, but using this type of loan on a home you'll keep indefinitely makes no sense.<P>

   The bottom line is that saving $30 per month on your mortgage payment could end up costing you more than $55,000. Ask the lender to find ways to make a 30-year (or less) loan work for you.<P>

   This could include a larger down payment, finding seller contributions to cover some of your closing costs or using some of your cash to pay off existing debts that may limit your borrowing power.<P>

   A good lender will not place you in any loan that's ultimately not a good financial move for you. If the lender isn't willing to explore other options, find another lender.<BR>
<BR>
I am preparing to list my house. Both agents who have viewed it said it needs some heavy cleaning. I'm not able to do it myself and assume that buyers will understand that when they view the house.<P>

  Is it really that important to have it clean? I thought buyers might use it as a bargaining point in negotiating.<BR>
