Q.<BR>
<BR>

We are the second owners of a pet chinchilla, and we feel the former owners weren't honest when they gave us this pet. He was fine and fun for the first month, but then he began to bite the hand that feeds him.<P>

   This unacceptable behavior puzzles us, but we'd rather address it than pass him on to a new owner.<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Your chinchilla is probably biting you for one or more of the following reasons: He may be bored and in need of a companion. He may be maturing and trying to assert his dominance, in which case he should grow out of it with regular handling (and gloves). Most likely, he's sexually frustrated and socially confused. When did he last see another chinchilla?<P>

   I really don't regard chinchillas as fully domesticated, safe and reliable animal companions. They were initially bred in captivity for their fur.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

Perhaps you read about the 13-year-old Connecticut girl who died of rabies recently. According to the media, she died of a strain of bat rabies, but didn't remember any encounter with a bat.<P>

   We have a stray cat living in our back yard and a lot of wildlife in our area. If the cat is vaccinated against rabies, can it still pass on another strain to humans, such as from a bat? Would another shot be harmful to the cat if she were already vaccinated? And do all animals have species-specific strains of rabies?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

There are different strains of rabies that occur in different species and act as reservoirs of infection for other species. The most common reservoir carriers are raccoons in the Eastern states, bats and foxes.<P>

   Outbreaks of rabies in these species often occur in cycles, generally when there is a high population. During the peak of these epidemics, domestic animals may be bitten by a rabid animal; cattle and free-roaming cats are the most frequent victims.<P>

   The anti-rabies vaccine will protect against the various strains of rabies, but will not protect an animal already infected.<P>

   This stray cat in your yard should be vaccinated and quarantined for 10 days. She should then be neutered and later vaccinated against common feline diseases. Neutering and vaccinating should be separated by an interval of several days to avoid adverse vaccine reactions. Ideally, you should find her a good home rather than release her back into the wild.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

Our 90-pound German shepherd has recently started dragging her left back foot. She is fine when she runs, but when she walks, you can definitely notice a lameness. She doesn't seem to be in pain.<P>

   Our vet thought the problem could be neurological or the onset of hip dysplasia, in which case nothing could be done. Any information would be welcome.<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

I'm not surprised that your dog has developed some weakness in her hindquarters at 9 years of age, considering that she's large-boned and heavy. German shepherds are especially prone to spinal problems as they get older.<P>

   Arthritic changes can interfere with nerve conduction and result in weakness in one or both hind legs and muscle atrophy. This becomes visible when the dog begins dragging her foot or placing it abnormally.<P>

   Put her on a strict diet to keep her slim and trim, and have your veterinarian prescribe an analgesic and an anti-inflammatory medication for when she's having difficulties.<P>

   This condition tends to occur periodically and may stabilize. However, it may become more frequent and severe. Regular, but not strenuous, exercise is beneficial. If she enjoys water and if you have access to a pool, swimming would be an ideal exercise for her.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

I have three indoor-outdoor cats and a dog. My dog is on the Program flea pills and is doing great. Now my vet says that, for the program to be totally effective, I should put my three cats on Program.<P>

   Program for cats is not a pill, but a liquid you mix in with their food. I don't know if my cats are fussier than most, but they won't eat the food if I add the medication. At my vet's suggestion, I tried mixing it with tuna, sardines and other strong-smelling fish, but they still won't eat it. How can I get them to take it?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Your vet is right to suggest a strong-smelling food such as sardines, but cats aren't easily fooled, as you've learned. They have sensitive noses and if they feel sick soon after eating one type of food, or are repelled by it, they're not likely to touch it again.<P>

   I suggest you give them sardines or whatever smelly food they relish once a week, and on the fourth week, try adding the pesticide.<P>

   I have serious misgivings about giving cats and dogs oral flea-killing medications like Program. It is a convenience for the owner and an alternative to more labor-intensive flea control. The easiest method of flea control is to keep your cats inside.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

My dog loves walking on the beach. A friend of mine said that children can get meningitis from walking on sand on which a dog has urinated. Is this so?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

There is nothing in dogs' urine that can cause meningitis in children. This rumor was probably based on a misunderstanding about a disease called visceral larva migrans that roundworm eggs in dogs' stools can cause in humans.<P>

   Beaches and parks have been made off-limits for dogs in part because of fears that children might get a disease from parasites in dogs' feces. People should pick up their dogs' droppings and put them in public trash containers or face heavy fines.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

I'm a junior in high school and am looking forward to studying veterinary medicine in college. Which colleges do you recommend?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

First, you should get an idea about what the job entails by helping to care for animals at a veterinary hospital or humane society. If you're interested in horses, farm or zoo animals, try to find a veterinarian who has time to show you the kind of work involved in treating these animals.<P>

   As for colleges, there may be a state veterinary college, which would be less expensive than private schools.<P>

   Contact the admissions department to determine the prerequisites for admission. Most often, you need an undergraduate degree in the biological or animal sciences. That means four years of college before veterinary school, which then entails another four years.<P>

   Good luck!<BR>
<BR>
