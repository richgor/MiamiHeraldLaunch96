   TOLLAND, Conn. -- Even Dennis Davey has to admit the house he designed for posterity hides its charms well.<P>

   Take away the shutters, the flower box, the white picket fence, and the model he built behind his office looks like one of those backyard storage sheds sold in flat boxes at home and garden centers. When people first see the house -- and lately, they've been coming to see it in droves -- the reaction is usually something like: ``You have got to be kidding.''<P>

   But Davey, a proud architect, takes no offense. ``That reaction,'' he said, ``is only when people see it from the OUTside.''<P>

   He is not fooling. Inside, it's another story. The entire wood-frame house is about the size of your average suburban family room -- 15 feet by 15 feet. Yet, oddly, it seems spacious. There is space above the white Melamine kitchen cabinets, space next to the bathroom for a walk-in closet, and space below the pitched roof for a loft bedroom.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   The house, obviously, is not for everyone. For several months after he built the model, Davey received few calls about it. But recent publicity in newspapers and a trade magazine has worked magic. Lately, he has been fielding calls from would-be buyers around the world.<P>

   ``Take a look at this,'' he said, showing off two large fistfuls of letters. ``I can't keep up.''<P>

   Would-be little-house buyers and distributors have decided that Davey just may have come up with the most radical idea in home ownership since Levittown.<P>

   Unlike other modular houses, Davey's 225-square-foot house is the first component of what he envisions as an expandable space that would eventually grow to become a standard-sized house. Buyers pay $9,950 cash (the introductory price) for the first unit.<P>

   Instead of feeding a bank a mortgage payment each month, they could pocket the savings until they could afford the next module, which doubles the space. With all three modules added, the house becomes a square, four-gabled model of 900 square feet. Its cost, mortgage-free (assuming the buyer owns the land to put it on): about $40,000.<P>

   While Davey designed the house, marketed as Hom4Me, as a primary residence, people are calling who are interested in using it in ways he never anticipated. A woman in Unadilla, N.Y., bought one to put behind her own house for her elderly father.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   An artist in Greenwich, Conn., is having Davey build one as a studio in her backyard. After so many queries from people interested in the house as a home office, Davey has designed a model specifically for that. (No kitchen; more storage space.)<P>

   The calls from developers are even more creative. A developer is interested in building the little houses as disaster-relief housing in Hong Kong.<P>

   Two or three housing authorities have shown interest in using the little houses for public housing. A builder in Wales is advertising to sell the little houses as vacation cottages. ``He thinks he can build 50 to 100 a year,'' Davey said.<P>

   And the most ambitious project for the little houses could create a virtual Daveytown. A nonprofit veterans' organization, Veterans' Creed Inc., is applying for a federal grant to build 5,800 for a National Veterans Residency, Retraining and Rehabilitation Center at Brooklyn's Floyd Bennett Field.<P>

   ``Mr. Davey's house is portable and it gives the veterans the respect of privacy,'' said Edward Bernard, Veterans' Creed's president. ``It also costs less than other options.''<P>

   Davey is tickled at the idea. He has been building and designing houses for more than 20 years, specializing in affordable, energy-efficient homes. After reading about the lack of affordable housing in Mississippi, he was struck with the idea for the little house.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   ``It was a moment of inspiration,'' he said. ``I sketched the original house in a couple of hours.'' It then took months to design the components in a way that would work and meet housing codes.<P>

   He is also proud to say he doesn't skimp on the amenities. The house uses standard building materials. There is no way to tell, but he believes that, unlike mobile homes, his little house will appreciate in value just like a standard house.<P>

   ``I've put this together so many times for so many people,'' he said, working the components of a cardboard model in his office as though it were a card trick.<P>

   Will people one day brag about owning a Davey house? ``Gosh,'' he said, grinning. ``Could be.''<BR>
