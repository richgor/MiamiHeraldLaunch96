<H2>Baywatch star buys estate from actor John Goodman</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
By RUTH RYON<BR>
Los Angeles Times<BR>
<P>

   Baywatch  star David Hasselhoff and his wife, actress Pamela Bach-Hasselhoff, have purchased the Encino, Calif. home of actor John Goodman for $1.5 million, sources say.<P>

   The asking price on the 1.5-acre estate had been about $2.5 million. Goodman bought it in 1991 for just under $3 million, sources say.<P>

   Built in 1988, the five-bedroom 6,000-square-foot compound includes a Colonial-style mansion, two guest houses, a tennis court, pool and spa. The home also has a pub room, gym, library and office.<P>

   Goodman, 43, is said to have a home in another state. In December, he announced that he would make only guest appearances on Roseanne,  renewed for a ninth season.<P>

   Hasselhoff, 43, is the highest-paid actor on syndicated television, sources say. Besides starring in Baywatch  and its spinoff Baywatch Nights,  he is one of the shows' four executive producers. When NBC dumped Baywatch  after a one-year run starting in 1989, Hasselhoff and his friends bought and produced the show, selling it to European syndicators and a U.S. distributor.<P>

   The network hadn't realized what a hit the series was in Europe, but Hasselhoff knew and realized its potential, having become a successful pop singer there after his series Knight Rider was canceled in 1986.<P>

   Baywatch now airs in more than 140 countries and is seen by one billion viewers a week.<P>

   A philanthropist who will be honored in June as the L.A. Make-a-Wish Foundation's Man of the Year, Hasselhoff is a businessman; he launched a line of Baywatch products, including swimsuits, and has plans for a series of Baywatch theme restaurants, sources say.<P>

   Bach-Hasselhoff, 30, also appears in Baywatch,  playing a former TV reporter who runs a beachfront cafe.<P>

   The Hasselhoffs, married since 1989, have two children and have been living in Sherman Oaks, Calif.<BR>

<H2>Dinah Shore home sells near $3 million</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   Dinah Shore's Beverly Hills home has been sold to a Beverly Hills couple, a plastic surgeon and a businesswoman, for just under $3 million, sources say.<P>

   The house, Shore's residence for nearly 30 years, first went on the market in July 1994, five months after the popular entertainer died there at age 76. The original asking price was $4.2 million.<P>

   Built in 1949, the 10,000-square-foot seven-bedroom home, on nearly an acre behind the Beverly Hills Hotel, has a tennis court, two-bedroom guest house, gym and office.<BR>

<H2>Linn-Baker, Lobel list L.A. house</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   Mark Linn-Baker, who played Larry Appleton for seven years in the comedy series Perfect Strangers,  and his wife, set designer Adrianne Lobel, have listed their Hollywood home at $2.4 million.<P>

   Linn-Baker, who made his film debut starring with Peter O'Toole in My Favorite Year (1982), co-stars with Nathan Lane (The Birdcage ) in the Broadway revival of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Lobel has designed sets for such Broadway productions as the 1994 Sondheim and Lapine musical Passion. <P>

   Linn-Baker, 42, and Lobel were married last June, just after he purchased the Hollywood home from actor John Hillerman. Lobel was living in New York. Now they're both living there. Linn-Baker has appeared in other Broadway plays and he is a founding director of the New York Stage and Film Co., which developed the one-man show Tru.<P>

   The home has city views, three bedrooms, a maid's room, loft, screening room and separate gym. The 8,000-square-foot estate also has a pool and spa.<BR>

<H2>$9.9 million price for Cher's ex-abode</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
   The Benedict Canyon house that Cher built and Eddie Murphy bought and sold has been renovated and put back on the market, this time at $9.9 million.<P>

   Murphy had it listed in 1990 at $9 million, but he sold it early last year for about $4 million, including furnishings he had purchased from Cher when he bought the house in the late 1980s.<P>

   Cher built the house about 15 years ago with the help of Beverly Hills designer Ron Wilson, and they decorated it in an Egyptian motif. Murphy added a projection room and called the home Moroccan in style.<P>

   The current owner, international investor Roberto Trouyet of the family that developed the Las Brisas hotel in Acapulco, Mexico, added about 4,000 square feet to the 10,000-square-foot residence and refurbished it. Trouyet has a home in Florida and property in Mexico, sources have said.<P>

   The Beverly Hills-area home, on four acres, has an atrium with a retractable roof, a screening room, game room, gym, office, six bedrooms plus a three-bedroom staff or guest quarters, 5,500 square feet of travertine terraces and a number of koi ponds.<BR>
