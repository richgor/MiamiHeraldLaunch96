 NEW YORK -- An exasperated billionaire refused to pay his interior designer's bills after he learned that four chairs of Russian Imperial provenance, purchased through the designer for $1 million, were worth one-tenth that amount.<P>

   An architect-designer regularly asks an antiques dealer to inflate prices to clients, to bolster his own commissions. One client, quoted $60,000 for a Directoire chair, returned alone for a second look and an unwitting assistant revealed its real price: $20,000.<P>

   Connie Uzzo, an Yves Saint Laurent executive, received a bill from a designer for 150 yards of drapery fabric. Puzzled, she climbed a stepladder to measure for herself. ``So I called up and demanded to know when I'd be receiving the additional 75 yards he'd charged me for,'' she said.<P>

   Tales of kickbacks, wavering markups and other deceptions carried out in the name of good taste are rampant in the increasingly competitive world of interior decoration. Few subjects are more intimidating to prospective clients and vexing to designers than how members of the profession determine their fees.<P>

   Conversations with 50 designers reveal an industry undergoing tremendous change as it strives to bring billing practices out of the shadows: The trend is toward disclosure and accountability.<P>

   ``There are so many scams in this business,'' said Niall Smith, owner of the Greenwich Village antiques store that bears his name. Smith said dealers often feel pressured by designers -- on whose loyalty the antiques world depends -- to hike the prices on specific objects. ``But believe me, no dealer wants any part of it,'' he said.<P>

   Penny S. Bonda, president of the 33,000-member American Society of Interior Designers, acknowledges that the perception of dishonesty in her field has eroded public confidence.<P>

   ``It's abhorrent to me,'' she said. ``But unfortunately, we get a bad reputation from a tiny minority of unprofessional designers who engage in shoddy business practices. Every profession has its crooks, and ours is no exception.''<P>

   The problem, Bonda said, has arisen in part because designers have historically functioned as the purveyors not only of their own talent and experience but also of merchandise. Suspicion, she said, inevitably arises with traditional retail billing when the client is charged the retail, price and the designer pockets the difference between this price and the net, or ``to-the-trade'' price, which can be from 10 to 50 percent less.<P>

   Since the discount is generally not revealed, the impression is created that designers are pulling the cashmere over clients' eyes.<P>

   ``Decorators have a horrible reputation for buying things at huge discounts and billing a fortune,'' said Greg Jordan, a Manhattan designer. ``It's irritating to the majority of professionals who are trying to make an honest living.''<P>

   Milly de Cabrol, a Manhattan designer, agreed: ``In the '80s, many decorators took their clients for a ride,'' she said. ``The business of decorating is changing. The best way of keeping clients happy is to present them with bills that show exactly how they're being charged and what your commission is.''<P>

   While many designers still bill retail and are content to keep their markups a mystery, an increasing number have instituted one of three alternative methods of billing, or a combination of them, furthering accountability and fostering the client's trust: ``cost plus'' (the net price and commission are revealed); a flat design fee (usually based on a percentage of the estimated total), or an hourly fee (charged for everything from shopping to design).<P>

   These methods are often used together. ``These days, everyone's trying to work out a creative deal, and you have to be flexible,'' said Jeffrey Bilhuber, a Manhattan designer.<P>

   It's a pragmatic decision: Americans remain hesitant about hiring a decorator. Fewer than 6 percent have ever done so, according to a study released last year by America's Research Group.<P>

   Prospective clients also are increasingly sophisticated about pricing, discounts and markups.<P>

   ``Clients travel, they check out prices, and they're no fools,'' said Brett Beldock, a Manhattan designer. ``What counts in this business is your reputation, and no one can afford to cheat their clients.''<P>

   The American Society of Interior Designers requires its professional members to agree to a code of ethics and to pass a licensing exam before using the society's initials after their name.<P>

   Interviews with designers and their clients show how three alternatives to retail billing can be beneficial to both sides.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   ``There's a good reason that cost plus is becoming the norm,'' said Marjorie Deane, who hired Brett Beldock last year to renovate and decorate her Fifth Avenue aerie. ``It's so much more straightforward than retail. You don't feel like you're being taken for a ride.''<P>

   Beldock charged a $2,000 nonrefundable design fee up front for preparing a presentation of swatches, colors and ideas. Then she submitted proposals to Deane showing the to-the-trade price for every item. To this, she added the appropriate taxes and an agreed-on commission of 30 percent on purchases and labor. As proof, she sent invoices from each vendor and a copy of each purchase order.<P>

   Beldock once encouraged clients to pay suppliers directly. But recently, she was burned by a client who agreed to purchases and then failed to pay. She now requires payment in advance.<P>

   Some clients worry that the cost-plus system may encourage designers to pick out expensive items, but Beldock found chairs at a tag sale, ``where my take was minimal,'' she said. Deane chose to have them elaborately refinished and upholstered, so Beldock's commission evened out.<P>

    Muriel Brandolini spent nine months redesigning the apartment of her client, Moira Mullholland. They agreed on an overall six-figure budget; Brandolini charged a fixed 25 percent design fee, payable in installments, and took no commission on what they bought.<P>

   ``It's simpler for everyone,'' she said of their arrangement. ``It avoids a huge amount of paperwork, because I just send the invoices from the vendors directly to Moira. . . . That way, she knows I'm not trying to rip her off.'' <P>

   Mullholland expressed her satisfaction with the results. ``It took away the anxiety for me,'' she said. ``Knowing that she wasn't earning any percentage on what I bought meant I never had to be nervous that she might be tempted to persuade me to purchase something just because it was more expensive.''<P>

<BR>

<P>

   ``I wanted to feel I was in control,'' said Shelly Shipper, a freelance writer whose designer, John Barman, suggested an hourly billing system for her SoHo loft renovation, buying at net price and passing his discount to his client. The project, which included construction, new appliances and decoration, took about six months and ended up costing Shipper about $75,000.<P>

   ``John charged me for his time at a rate of $200 an hour and sent me periodic bills,'' Shipper said. Her project required 40 hours of Barman's time.<P>

   ``Maybe other people would require a lot of hand-holding, but I didn't,'' she said. ``I felt I saved money by hiring the contractor and painters independently, with his advice. He steered me toward the right sources. For instance, he called and suggested I buy a carpet he had seen at ABC. It was perfect, and I didn't have to pay him a commission.'' <P>

   But the hourly-fee method is not for everyone. ``For clients who have trouble making up their minds, it can wind up very expensive,'' Barman said. ``It could take maybe 10 hours to find an inexpensive lamp, but it usually evens out for the client because you're not taking a percentage on purchases.''<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   In the retail method, the client agrees to pay retail for furnishings, but the designer's markup is generally not referred to in the contract. As with all of these methods, an estimate is usually sent for the client's approval before a purchase is made or custom work begins, and payment or partial payment is required in advance.<P>

   It is defended by its well-established practitioners, including Albert Hadley, Mark Hampton and Mario Buatta.<P>

   ``Our talent and expertise are hard to put a price on,'' Buatta said. ``But charging retail seems fair to me because you always end up doing a thousand things for your client that aren't necessarily listed in your contract.''<P>

   Karen Fisher of Designer Previews, a company she describes as ``a matchmaking service to help people find the decorator who's right for them,'' said: ``Working out a contract with a clear understanding of the budget, the time involved and the method of billing is vital. Everything must be discussed, explained and agreed to in advance.''
