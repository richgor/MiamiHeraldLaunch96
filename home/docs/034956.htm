`NEOTRADITIONAL' COMMUNITY: A rendering of a typical street in Abacoa, a planned community designed to avoid the traditional trappings of modern suburbia. Among the features: narrowed streets, and front porches placed near the sidewalks to encourage interaction.<BR>

  Most of us complain about where we live. The suburbs sprawl, downtowns decay. Today, a few people are trying to build something completely different: Utopia. This story is the last of a three-part series about communities that challenge the way the rest of us live.<BR>

S<BR>
omething is rotten in suburbia, the popular thinking goes, and now there's a fix. It's called the New Urbanism, an architectural movement that seeks to halt the spread of walled, homogeneous subdivisions and proposes to replace them with something more like a traditional town. There, it is hoped, everyone can live happily ever after.<P>

   Sound familiar? It should. Led by Miami architects Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, the revival of neotraditional town-planning has enchanted the media, repeatedly getting favorable coverage in, among others, Metropolitan Home,<BR>
Time and Newsweek, which last year devoted a 13-page cover story to New Urbanist concepts.<P>

   But while the movement has succeeded with journalists, it has stalled with developers, especially in South Florida. Despite the proximity of Duany and Plater-Zyberk, there are no New Urbanist communities here.<P>

   Now that may change -- and in a big way. Developers in Jupiter last month began clearing land for an immense neotraditional town designed by the Miami couple and two like-minded California firms. Abacoa, as the project is known, covers more than three square miles, would house more than 6,000 families, reserves space for manufacturing, offices and schools, and includes a town center three times as big as Cocowalk, the shopping complex in Coco<BR>
nut Grove.<P>

   ``The purpose of this project is not just to build homes and shops and offices,'' said the developer, George de Guardiola, ``but to build a community.''<P>

   This, in short, is the credo of the New Urbanists, a group for whom community represents something of a Holy Grail. Like many contemporary social critics, they trace all manner of societal ills -- crime, greed, teen angst -- back to the nation's fraying sense of togetherness, and ultimately, back to the landscape.<P>

   ``Eighty percent of everything ever built in America has been built in the last 50 years,'' begins one screed in James Howard Kunstler's recent The Geography of Nowhere, ``and most of it is depressing, brutal, ugly, unhealthy and spiritually degrading -- the jive-plastic commuter tract home wastelands, the Potemkin village shopping plazas. . . the `gourmet mansardic' junk-food joints, the Orwellian office parks. . . the whole destructive, wasteful, toxic, agoraphobia-inducing spectacle.''<BR>
 <BR>
`The Suburban Era'<BR>
<P>

   Indeed, the fate of neotraditional planning ideas could prove critical to the future of America's landscape. The 1990 census confirmed that the United States has entered ``The Suburban Era.'' About half of the country's population now lives in suburbs, up from a quarter in 1950 and a third in 1960. The shift has created a new landscape -- of walled subdivisions, burger joints and malls -- that some find alien.<P>

   But would a neotraditional town like Abacoa cultivate a sense of community any more than, say, Weston, or one of the subdivisions proliferating in Pembroke Pines? Simply recreating the architecture of the past, after all, won't necessarily bring back the likes of Ward and June Cleaver, or the sociable era of bowling leagues and garden clubs.<P>

   But architecture can foster community, according to advocates, and New Urbanist practices do so in three ways:<P>

   <LI> New Urbanists emphasize the importance of public gathering spaces.<P>

   No home in Abacoa is more than a five-minute walk from a neighborhood square. Each of Abacoa's 10 neighborhoods, in fact, is anchored by one of these squares, which, with homes circled around and facing in, often look like a New England town green. This is the place to play ball, stroll or chat with neighbors.<P>

   Moreover, Abacoa's 10 neighborhoods are clustered around two larger public spaces. One is the town center, essentially one shop-lined street; the other is a 300-acre greenway that winds with a jogging path through the community.<BR>
<P>

   <LI> New Urbanists favor pedestrians over drivers.<P>

   This bias stems from the belief that a neighborhood that encourages pedestrians will prove more social than one that surrenders roads solely to automobiles.<BR>
   Streets in Abacoa will be as much as 10 feet narrower than comparable streets in Weston or other contemporary subdivisions. This slows traffic, making walking safer and more pleasant. There are other inducements for pedestrians, too. Shady trees -- not palms -- will keep sidewalks cooler. A strip of grass at least five feet wide will separate strollers from passing cars. Most importantly, the street system favored by contemporary subdivisions -- the curvy maze of cul-de-sacs -- will be replaced in favor of a modified grid. (The intersecting streets of a grid make it easier to walk from place to place.)<P>

   <LI> New Urbanists mix apartments, townhomes and houses -- even small offices and corner stores -- within the same neighborhood.<P>

   This is a radical departure from most new housing developments, which scrupulously segregate buildings based on their function and size.<P>

   Shops, for example, are separated from homes. (This means there's no walking to the corner store for a carton of milk.) Homes, in turn, are divided into pods based on income and size. Some neighborhoods, for example, consist exclusively of ``starter homes'' (young couples) or family homes (couples with kids) or ``empty-nesters.''<P>

   This isolation wears on the fabric of community, according to de Guardiola, because when a family's circumstances change -- requiring a different type of home -- the family can't find one within the neighborhood.<BR>
Investing in `human capital'<BR>
<P>

   ``There is a serious loss of vital human capital, an essential ingredient of the community,'' said de Guardiola, who also directed development at Wellington. ``I have witnessed this happening over and over.''<P>

   Anticipating such changes, each neighborhood within Abacoa includes at least three housing sizes, from townhomes to large houses, prices ranging from $80,000 to $300,000.<P>

   ``If a person likes his neighborhood but needs a different house, he can just recycle himself within that neighborhood, keeping the friends, maintaining the civic standing,'' said de Guardiola.<P>

   So far, so good. But why haven't more developers signed up? Plans for the first New Urbanist project, the Panhandle resort town of Seaside, after all, were drafted more than a decade ago. Today, there are just 37 such projects under construction in the United States. That group involves tens of thousands of homes, to be sure, but a drive out to West Kendall or Pembroke Pines tells you that far more developers are ignoring New Urbanism than embracing it.<BR>
<P>

   Primarily, it seems, home builders are reluctant to stray from contemporary sprawl design because it has proved commercially successful.<P>

    ``Most developers would rather look at what works and simply duplicate it,'' de Guardiola said. ``But I believe this community will sell even better. Anyway, I was already in the business of building homes, so why not build community, too?''<P>

   Secondly, what troubles developers about New Urbanism is that usually, well, it's illegal. Local zoning codes often prohibit the fundamentals of neotraditional planning, forbidding narrow streets, for example, and the neighborly corner store. (As Duany likes to point out, some of the nation's most cherished places -- such as Key West -- could not be built under contemporary zoning.) To build Abacoa, notes Abacoa architect Scott Hedge, the developer had to write a new 70-page section to the town of Jupiter's codes.<P>

   Finally, even if a builder is willing to entertain New Urbanist ideas, the builder often first looks to Seaside, which has become something of an icon for the movement. But the homes at Seaside -- designed by notable architects from across the country -- while delightful, have the odd effect of scaring off the average subdivision builder.<P>

   ``There's not really any merchant builder that even remotely relates to Seaside,'' de Guardiola said. ``You're talking about houses built by custom carpenters on a one-by-one basis, not production homes. They're doing 20 homes a year. If any of us were thinking along those lines, we'd all go broke. It's almost a philanthropic exercise.''<BR>
Suburbs prove resilient<BR>
<P>

   Today, the fate of New Urbanism depends on the level of discontent in suburbia. Over the years, however, suburbia has faced -- and survived -- attacks time and again.<P>

   Three decades ago, architecture critic Lewis Mumford said that post-World War II development leads to ``an encapsulated life, spent more and more either in a motor car or within the cabin of darkness before a television set.'' For novelist John Cheever, the suburbs of the '50s served as a stage for alienated characters. By 1967, even the Monkees, the typically saccharine Beatles knock-off, were taking aim:<P>

   Another Pleasant Valley Sunday<P>

   Here in Status Symbol Land<P>

   Today, artists and critics continue to lampoon suburbia. Check out the garish pastel subdivision of the film Edward Scissorhands. Listen to Soul Asylum's song Black Gold. Or take in Eric Bogosian's play Suburbia, where the action takes place, for lack of anything better, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven.<P>

   Is it really that bad? The answer may prove critical to the New Urbanism, which today is the most popular alternative to conventional suburbia.
