<m0>   What can you do with leftover wallpaper? Lots of things.<ep>
   You can make lamp shades, file folders, book covers, decorative boxes, book marks or line closet shelves.<ep>
   Donna Lang, interior designer and author of <m0>Decorating With Paper<m0>  (Clarkson Potter Publishers, New York, paperback $24), recommends Village wallpapers for the variety of styles and user friendliness.<ep>
   ``Whenever I buy wallpaper, I order an extra roll because it may be hard to find a perfect color match if you run short,'' she said. ``And there are many wonderful things you can make with leftover wallpaper.''<ep>
   Here are some tips from her book on how to make a pleated lamp shade cover:<ep>
   (box) Start with an old or existing lamp shade and leftover wallpaper or wallpaper borders. You will need a hole punch, pencil, ruler, ribbon, decorative cord or rope.<ep>
   (box) Cut a strip of wallpaper or border that is twice as long as the circumference of the shade bottom, and one-half inch wider than the shade height. (For example, if the shade measures 36 inches around the bottom, cut 72 inches of wallpaper. If the shade is 12 inches tall, make your strip 12 1/2 inches wide.)<ep>
   (box) You can make pleats that are one-half inch or 1 1/8 inch deep. (The wallpaper design and size of shade will help you make that decision.) Mark off the pleats on the back of the paper. If you are opting for three-quarter-inch pleats, make a dot every three-quarter inch.<ep>
   (box) Using the straight edge of your paper as a guide, fold every other line in the same direction the full length of the paper.<ep>
   (box) Turn the paper over and create matching fold lines in the middle of each fold, creating an accordion effect.<ep>
   (box) Punch holes three-quarter-inch from the top, in the center of each pleat.<ep>
   (box) Overlap the last pleat and paste in place. (Many papers are prepasted, so no glue is necessary. Just dampen with a sponge.)<ep>
   (box) Lace decorative cord or ribbon through the holes at the top of the shade and tie ends in a bow. Snip ends of ribbon on an angle and place over your existing lamp shade.<ep>
