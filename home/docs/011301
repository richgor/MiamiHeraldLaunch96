<m0>We have a collection of 29 pieces of old Moon and Star pattern glass, all in perfect condition, which belonged to our 96-year-old mother. <ep>
   Pieces include two sizes of compotes with lids, spoon holders, cake dish, etc. Where can we find a buyer? We also have a table lamp in perfect condition, designed with a figure of Ann Morrow Lindbergh standing on top of the world with a full parachute with star cutouts. How can we learn more about it?<ql>
