<m0>   HIGH POINT, N.C. (--) Casual furniture in soft, textured fabrics. Big beds. Cushy, wide chairs. Colors and prints that pay homage to nature.<ep>
   These were trends at the International Home Furnishings Market last week. The abundance of comfortable, casual designs indicates that manufacturers are trying to make things people like and will buy.<ep>
   ``Manufacturers used to say in the late '70s and '80s, `We're doing mauve,' or `We're doing Oriental,' '' said Michael Delgaudio, vice president and creative director of Century Furniture. ``Now we're doing what consumers want.''<ep>
   Manufacturers appear to be concentrating on high-end goods ``and getting rid of the lower end. . . . They are reinforcing quality,'' said Jerry Epperson, industry analyst with Mann, Armistead & Epperson in Richmond, Va. ``The baby boomers are replacing their furniture, and they want quality goods. They are shopping value.''<ep>
   If there's one piece of furniture boomers want, it's a big, ``important'' bed. Sleigh beds, four-posters and high headboards are available in many styles and finishes. And if the ceiling isn't high enough to accom<m2><ql>

FURNITURE,  FROM  1H<ql>
<m0>modate a four-poster, never fear. Manufacturers offer shorter posts.<ep>
    People all over the world are this huge market's target. It draws 70,000 buyers, including 9,000 from 90 foreign countries. The mix of languages in the corridors emphasizes the international aspect, while the frantic pace is a reminder that the seven million square feet of showrooms in 150 buildings must be covered at a fast clip in order to see even a fraction of the vast offerings.<ep>
   As huge as the market is, there was some downsizing this spring. Fewer collections were introduced, though there were plenty of choices, thanks to new finishes or fabrics on past introductions.<ql>
<m1>Too many collections?<ep>
<m0>   ``We have been `collectioned' to death,'' said W.R. Martin Jr., president of Lane Advertising, a division of the Lane Co. ``Our dealers are saying, `Give us a break. Give us some good bread-and-butter furniture.' For every new collection, they've got to do a promotion, and it costs them. We do not have a major collection this market, just a few pieces in an 18th Century cherry group.''<ep>
   It takes a manufacturer about six months to make a collection after it's ordered by retailers. Thus, Lane's Marrakesh Collection of 70 pieces, introduced at last October's market, is just being shipped to the stores, Martin said. New products shown at this market will reach the stores by early fall.<ep>
   Here are some of the trends spotted at the market:<ep>
   (box)<m0> Casual comfort. <m0>America's love of staying home and kicking back with a video has manufacturers turning out pieces with deeper seats, higher backs and down-filled cushions. The chair-and-a-half, with space for you and Rover to curl up in, has become a standard offering for most upholstery manufacturers.<ep>
   Though some formal sofas still have fringed skirts, the trend in casual is toward an unstructured, simply tailored, slipcovered look. Some leather sofas are upholstered to look like they are dressed in slipcovers, while designer/manufacturer Mitchell Gold offers an entire collection of muslin-upholstered furniture that comes with washable slipcovers.<ep>
   The totally upholstered sofa and chair shares floor space with those featuring exposed wood on the arms and legs. These latter designs are reminiscent of 1930s furniture.<ep>
   Designer Georgio (one name only, please) offers the ultimate comfort in a 74-inch-long, four-cushion sofa ($6,000 in chenille) that has a foot blanket attached to each arm. The blankets can be flipped over to keep toes warm on chilly nights, or unsnapped and used as a throw.<ep>
   For a lot of people, a recliner represents the ultimate comfort, such as La-Z-Boy's ``Sonoma.'' This chair swivels, rocks and reclines, has storage compartments under each arm, and costs $645 in a fabric cover.<ep>
   (box) <m0>Fabrics. <m0>Chenille is the top upholstery fabric, but it's not the bedspread fabric of your childhood. This is a finely woven ribbed cotton that feels like velvet and suits dressy or casual upholstery. Quilted silks, carved velvets, washed denim, linen in damask designs and mohair/silk combinations are other upholstery offerings.<ep>
   Paisley, plaid, checks and toile appeared in many collections. When the colors are coordinated, two or more of these patterns work together (--) at least in the hands of professional designers.<ep>
   Leopard-skin patterns continue to be popular on pillows, chairs and ottomans, and as throws.<ql>
<m1><styl>cxon<ql>
<m2> <ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Texture, such as a basketweave design or an embossed pattern, is the watchword for fabrics. Some manufacturers showed room settings with a monochromatic theme that weren't dull, thanks to the rich texture of the fabrics.<ql>
<m1><styl>cxoff<ql>
<ep>
<m0>   Upholstery designers are using dressmaker details in a literal fashion, such as a contrast band of fabric secured to a chair or sofa skirt with large buttons.<ep>
   Chintz, so popular in the late '80s and early '90s, has almost disappeared, except as a cover on a few traditional pieces.<ep>
   Leather upholstery continues strong, frequently shown in a matte rather than shiny finish.<ep>
   (box) <m0>Colors. <m0>Taupe and variations of earth tones emerge as the most prevalent color in fabrics. Woodsy greens stand alone or mix with the brown tones in prints that are often leaf designs. Sage green and pale olive are more prevalent than bright shades and are sometimes combined with purple.<ep>
   The palette is generally so subdued that the occasional bright red sofa or chair was a welcome sight. Thayer Coggin introduced a lipstick red leather wing chair, the Pasadena, $5,495 retail, that comes with silver-, gold- or bronze-leaf legs.<ep>
   (box) <m0>Casegoods. <m0>Wood finishes also pay homage to the environment with earthy tones, golden honey browns or pale shades of sand. Lighter finishes and larger-scaled pieces convey a more casual feeling in European-inspired tables and cabinets.<ep>
   Marble tops are showing up on dressers, consoles and occasional tables.<ep>
   Bachelor's chests (--) a few inches taller and narrower than a standard dresser (--) offer more drawers while taking up less space.<ep>
   Several manufacturers showed cabinets, bookcases and occasional tables with doors or drawers of fake book spines. John Widdicomb introduced a Mario Buatta-designed faux book cabinet for real books or collectibles.<ep>
   Metal trim is important on casegoods in both traditional and contemporary styles. Hardware is an integral part of the piece, often stained or painted to match the wood.<ep>
   (box) <m0>New collections. <m0>Thomasville introduced Renaissance, more than 100 pieces inspired by the art and architecture of the Mediterranean coasts of France and Italy. The wood pieces are made of oak and oak veneers and are available in Stucco, a white painted finish, and Riviera, a warm fruitwood color. The upholstery in this collection is richly colored tapestry weaves and mosaic patterns, with tufting, bullion and cutwork fringes.<ep>
   Stickley introduced 21st Century Mission, which has a more refined, mellow finish than the original rustic Mission style. In the Mission reissues, a small but distinctive desk made news. Designed in 1903-04 by architect Harvey Ellis for Gustav Stickley's Workshops, the original desk sold recently at Christie's for $75,000. You can own a copy for $3,970.<ep>
   Pulaski introduced several new curio cabinets ($999 retail) in washed and crackle finishes with the South Florida market in mind. Many of the curios are as wide as a china cabinet and include a tall case clock. Pulaski also exhibited computer work stations with faux book cabinet doors, a stack of oversized ``books'' that conceal a file cabinet, cultured fossil stone tables, and several small occasional tables painted to look like Sheraton inlay designs.<ql>
<m1>New pieces added<ep>
<m0>   Baker Furniture marked the 20th anniversary of the Historic Charleston Collection (--) one of the industry's first licensed reproductions programs (--) by adding several new pieces in pine, cherry, beech and metal. Many of the wood pieces have a new subtle finish and hand-planed surfaces, a physical distressing technique that simulates the natural waves found on the surface of antique furniture.<ep>
   Bassett Furniture displayed 69 new pieces in the J.G. Hook collection that's inspired by the oceanfront of the Hamptons on Long Island. The finishes include honey maple and chestnut; the signature bed is a wicker sleigh style.<ep>
   Councill Cos. unveiled a licensed furniture line inspired by New Orleans. A key piece is the Barbados Console, of mahogany and antique brass.<ep>
   Hyundai Furniture Industries displayed furniture made of rubberwood. Once burned after producing latex for up to 15 years, rubber trees have the same carving and finish properties as cherry and mahogany. Rubberwood is used in the company's Contemporary Classic grouping that includes a round table with heat-tempered ``bubble'' glass in the cross base.<ql>
<m1>Upholstery is cheerful<ep>
<m0>   Hickory Chair had some of the most colorful and cheerful upholstery, including bright yellow prints. In casegoods, the company showed adaptations of early French and British Canadian furniture, including ladder-back chairs and painted chests. Among Mark Hampton's designs for Hickory Chair, two small items stood out: a round table ($950) with a checkerboard painted on top, and an upholstered footstool ($500) with ``toes'' peeking out at each corner.<ep>
   Broyhill brought out Estancia, a collection influenced by classic Italian and French elements, including architectural Palladian doors, bed posts with linen-fold carving, flowering urn finials and carved floral motifs.<ep>
   John Widdicomb introduced the 1940s French Collection, dining and living room furniture by designer Chad Womack. Inspired by the work of French designers of the period, the collection features decorative inlays of fine wood veneers and a lot of detail and handrubbed finishes.<ql>
