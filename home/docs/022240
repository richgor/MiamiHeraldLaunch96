<m0>   If you are a raw beginner home buyer, this is a good book to study because it's basic and non-technical. However, if you already know the home buying basics, the book is rather elementary.<ep>
   Author William J. Molloy has 23 years of experience as a real estate agent, property manager and home builder. He is obviously well-qualified to write this book. Molloy shares some of his personal experiences, thus making the book enjoyable and believeable.<ep>
   Molloy's practical experience in solving home-buying problems is obvious. For example, he says there are two types of real estate attorneys: deal makers and deal breakers. Molloy also emphasizes the physical aspects of houses, such as water, sewage disposal, surveys, elevations and inspections. But the author seems hung up on water and waste disposal; he even includes a drawing of an outdoor privy.<ql>

<m0>   Chapter topics include: What is Real Estate?, What Can I Afford?, What is a Mortgage?, How Do I Qualify the House?, Radon, Water (--) Where Does It Come From?, What is a Survey?, Homeowner Warranties, and The Closing. As you can tell from the topics, the book is very basic.<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   The author has many years of practical home sales and construction experience. But <m1> <m0>being from New York State, he emphasizes <m1> <m0>sales methods used there, especially the antiquated <m1> <m0>closing procedures. On my scale of one to 10, this book rates an eight.<ql>
