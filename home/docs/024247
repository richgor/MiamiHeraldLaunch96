<m0>My young coconut palm has been attacked by honeybees that are killing the new growth. What do I do to get rid of the bees and save my palm?<ql>
<m0>L.R., <m0>Miami<m0><ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>The problem your palm is experiencing is not due to the bees, but to another cause. Bees do not harm plants but are responsible for the pollination of billions of dollars worth of commercial crops. Bees are even one of the pollinators of coconut.<ep>
  If the bees are a health problem or in a problem area, you can call the Natural Bee Honey Co. at 258-1110 or American Apiary at 624-0131 to remove the bees for a fee. The cost is usually less than $100.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>

<m0>We just moved into a home. There were several dead branches on a crape myrtle. When I cut those branches off, there were lots of ants inside. Will they kill the rest of the plant?<ql>
<m0>R.H., <m0>Cutler Ridge<m0><qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>No. The tree was probably in a state of decline before you moved into the new home. That limb was probably dead and the ants moved in, making it their new home. Cut the dead limbs from the crape myrtle, and the ants probably will leave with the loss of their home.<ep>
  Put the tree on a regular fertilization program, and it should return to its original glory. Fertilize the plant with a slow-release fertilizer that contains micronutrients three to four times yearly.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>There is some kind of a beetle on our mango flowers. It is a little bigger than a May beetle, black with small white spots, and moves slowly. Is this beetle actually eating the flowers?<ql>
<m0>J.D., <m0>Hialeah<m0><qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>The beetle you are describing is a euphoria beetle. It feeds on pollen. But while it is feeding, it is also supplying the tree with a service (--) pollination. If there are large numbers, simply pick them off and dispose of them. If you spray a pesticide while the tree is in bloom, there is a good chance you will kill other pollinizers, diminishing fruit set.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>

<m0>We had a load of sand delivered, and with it came what have been identified as mole crickets. They have now been distributed throughout our yard. What do we do to get rid of them?<ql>
<m0>T.K., <m0>Miami<m0><qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>Mole crickets prefer a loose, open soil and do not thrive in thick, healthy turf. If you have a good, healthy lawn, the mole crickets may move on. However, the mole crickets will most likely need to be controlled. There are several biological controls available, but they may be difficult to find.<ep>
   One is the parasitic nematode Steinernema scapterisci, which has been field-tested in northern Florida and appears to be promising. A parasitic fly, fungi, predatory beetle larva and a South African pathogenic virus have all been tested and appear to be effective biological controls.<ep>
   If these biological controls cannot be found, you can use Dursban 0.5 percent bait applied to the lawn according to label directions.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>

<m0>There has been a beautiful flowering tree with showy bright yellow flowers blooming during the end of March and first part of April. The tree has a light-colored, deeply furrowed bark and silver-green leaves, which it appears to be losing. What tree is this?<ql>
<m0>W.D., <m0>North Miami<m0><qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>The tree you are describing is the silver trumpet tree (Tabebuia caraiba). It is a fast-growing and relatively care-free tree. It is propagated from seed or grafting, and it flowers from seed in about three years. The tree seems to flower best following cool, dry winters.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>

<m0>I recently wrote to the University of Florida to order a copy of the Vegetable Garden Guide and was told it was currently unavailable. How can I get a copy for this year's warm season garden?<ql>
<m0>D.H., <m0>Kendall<m0><qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>The Vegetable Gardening Guide can be purchased for 50 cents from the Dade County Cooperative Extension Service, 18710 SW 288th St., Homestead, Fla. 33030. If you wish, a copy can be mailed to you for 50 cents plus a self-addressed, stamped, business-size envelope to the above address.<ep>
   This is a wonderful publication that lists many of the vegetables grown in South Florida, includes their planting and harvest dates, and tells a little about their care.<ql>
