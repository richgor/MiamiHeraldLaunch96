<m0>Q.<ql>

<m0>I collect cast iron and have a piece I can't find in any books. I'm enclosing a description and photo of it and hope you can identify it. I got it from an 89-year-old woman who said her mother cooked on it in a fireplace.<ep>
   The piece, which is old and made of cast iron (and which presumably is a bacon griddle once used for fireplace cooking) has a heavy rectangular-shaped pan measuring 13 1/2 inches long, 10 1/2 inches wide and one-half inch deep, which stands on four three-inch-high tapered legs.<ep>
   It has an 8 1/2-inch-long handle that's an inch thick and is flat on top and rounded on the bottom, marked with a raised X on top of the handle where it's attached to the back of the pan. The pan has a 1-inch-deep and 10 1/2-inch-wide grease drain across the end. How can I find out more about this 16-pound piece?<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>Your presumption is right. The piece is indeed a griddle complete with a grease trough for collecting grease or frying fat. It dates from the late 18th or early 19th Century and is most desirable and uncommon, being cast instead of wrought (--) as most examples of this type are (--) and having an X (or witchmark) on its handle, put there by the maker to ward off witches and demons.<ep>
   To check out griddles with a solid frying or cooking surface (rather than an open gratelike one) or any other early fireplace cooking implements, write to Pat Guthman, Pat Guthman Antiques Inc., 281 Pequot Ave., Southport, Conn. 06490. Enclose a photo of the piece (or pieces) and a self-addressed, stamped envelope for a reply.<ep>
   Also available from Pat is her show-and-tell video, <m0>Hot and Heavy (--) 18th Century Iron for Cooking at the Fireplace,<m0>  which costs $29.95 plus $4 shipping.<ql>
