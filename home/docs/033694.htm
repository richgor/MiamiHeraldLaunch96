I am in the process of buying a home. My attorney explained I will have to pay for a lender's title insurance policy, but I have the option of buying an owner's title policy for my equity. When I asked if the coverages are the same, she explained the lender's title policy is more complete. When I said I would like the same coverage for my $80,000 equity, the title insurer refused to write it. Why?<BR>
<BR>
A lender's title insurance policy offers better coverage than an owner's policy. For example, it insures against additional title risks due to water rights, rights of occupants, zoning, unrecorded easements and encroachments that are generally not included in owners' policies.<P>

   Lenders' title policies are better because the lender doesn't have an opportunity to inspect the property. When an owner wants to buy a lender's title policy, title companies are wary. They will usually issue lender's policies to homeowners only after careful research.<BR>
<BR>
Next month we plan to put our home up for sale. How much higher should we set our asking price than we expect to get? Friends tell us to ask at least 5 to 10 percent more than we'll take. Is this correct?<BR>
<BR>
No. If your home is overpriced, many realty agents and their prospective buyers won't waste time looking at it. An overpriced residence indicates the seller is not motivated and is just testing the market.<P>

   The best way to set your asking price is to invite at least three successful realty agents to give you listing presentations. Each should give you his or her opinion of your home's market value, along with a written CMA (comparative market analysis).<P>

   This form shows recent sales prices of comparable nearby homes. Each agent will then discuss the pros and cons of your home compared to the recent sales, as well as the asking prices of similar neighborhood homes now listed for sale.<P>

   Only after you have this information will you be in a position, with the help of your agent, to set an intelligent asking price.<P>

   If you want a quick sale, set your price right at market value. If you prefer to leave a little room for negotiation, it's all right to set the asking price slightly above market value. That way, your buyer feels good about getting a bargain and you'll feel good you got the best possible price. <BR>
<BR>
Several weeks ago, you answered a reader's question about a possibly settling front porch. We had a similar situation when we sold our home about two years ago. The buyer commented about the sloping front porch, but I said something like, ``Well, this house is over 40 years old, so it shows how little, if any, settlement there has been.''<P>

   However, the buyer made a big deal out of the slight slope and negotiated the price down $2,500. I've driven by the house many times; the buyers never fixed the front porch slope. All they did was use it to drive the price down. I agree with you that an obvious situation like that should not be raised by the seller, because buyers will use it against the seller.<BR>
<BR>
As I emphasized in my answer, front porches are often used by home buyers to bargain the price down, even if the slope is very slight, as it was in your situation. But several readers wrote to say that the seller should bring a slight porch slope to a buyer's attention.<P>

   I disagree. Porches should slope slightly to drain away rainwater. Unless the slope is serious, or there is evidence of settling, why give the buyer ammunition to drive down the price? As in your situation, the sloping porch probably isn't worth correcting.<BR>
<BR>
I received a job promotion that required a move on very short notice. My wife and I had one week to locate either a home to buy or an apartment to rent. <P>

   We thought we had found an ideal home, which we purchased. But after moving in, we discovered the wiring is defective; the plumbing is leaking in the walls; the built-in stove and dishwasher have to be replaced; the exterminator can't get rid of the cockroaches; and the main support beam in the attic is sagging, indicating inadequate support.<P>

   We foolishly rushed into this home purchase without getting a professional inspection. Is there any way we can hold the seller and/or the realty agent liable for correcting these defects?<BR>
<BR>
Yes. You are the out-of-town home buyer every seller and realty agent dream about, since you were in such a rush to buy that you forgot about precautions buyers should take.<P>

   In most states, the days of ``caveat emptor'' (let the buyer beware) are long gone. The defects you describe were surely known to the seller and probably the realty agent, making them liable to you for repair or replacement costs.<P>

   But you'll need to hire a good real estate attorney to prove the seller and/or realty agent knew of these defects. Your legal choice is to sue for either monetary damages or rescission of the sale.<P>

   In the future, be sure to include a contingency clause for a professional inspection. In addition, insist that the seller or realty agent provide a one-year home warranty policy.<BR>
<BR>
In mid-November, I completed the purchase of a home, using the same realty agent who sold my former residence in January. After the closing, she promised to send a handyman if I had any problems. <P>

   Although I had the house professionally inspected, within a few weeks of my taking possession, the dining room wiring short-circuited, the bathroom electric wall heater failed to function, and the garage door opener cable broke. When I phoned my agent, she failed to return my calls. I phoned the seller, and he came over to fix the dining room wiring. He's also trying to fix the bathroom heater. I haven't told him <BR>
 <BR>
about the garage door opener yet.<P>

      What service should I expect from my realty agent?<BR>
<BR>
My first remark is shame on your agent for not promptly returning your calls and providing you with a one-year home warranty policy. Although home sellers often pay the cost of about $300 for a one-year home warranty policy as a sales inducement, many realty agents buy these policies for their buyers, because they know it builds goodwill and prevents future trouble. <P>

   I suggest you phone your agent's broker-manager immediately. There is no excuse for her refusal to return your calls.<P>

   The seller and realty agent, however, have no legal liability for the problems that occurred after the sale, unless you can prove they knew of the defects.<BR>
<BR>
Last spring, you told a reader that realty agents must present all purchase offers to their home sellers, no matter how ridiculous they seem. That's what happened to us.<P>

   We had been looking for a home in a special neighborhood for at least a year. In October, we found the perfect home for our family, but we thought it was grossly overpriced. It had been listed for sale at least six months. The listing agent, whom we met at an open house, laughed when we mentioned the price we wanted to offer.<P>

   So we went to a realty agent friend, who presented our offer. The seller countered. We countered and the seller accepted. This week, we moved into our dream home. Thank you for your article, which got us the perfect home in a great school district. <BR>
<BR>
Your letter shows why realty agents must present all purchase offers to home sellers, unless instructed otherwise by the sellers.<BR>
