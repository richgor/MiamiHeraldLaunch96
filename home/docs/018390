<m0>   If decorating is on your ``to do'' list, consider putting this item at the very top: ``Consult an interior designer.''<ep>
   It doesn't have to cost a fortune. A professional designer can put together all the elements of a design project and will work on one room at a time if that's what your budget allows. Consider the three-year association of Nancy Charles, a Realtor with Coldwell Banker who lives in Miami Lakes, and Roger Zwickel, a designer at Burdines.<ep>
   ``I didn't want to do the entire house over, and I had some pieces I wanted to use,'' <m1> <m0>Charles said. ``The <m2><ql>

DESIGNERS,  FROM  1H<ql>
<m0>good thing about Roger is that he works with what you have and no job is too small or too large. He helped me with wallpapering, draperies, blinds, area rugs.''<ep>
   Charles said she didn't have a fixed budget and doesn't really know how much she has spent over the three years. ``But I did spend $3,000 for a sideboard for the dining room, and I think it looks more expensive. I thought it would be too big for the space, but Roger said it would look smashing, and it does.''<ep>
   If hired early, a designer can help you avoid costly mistakes. Why? Because not many of us have the eye to choose furnishings in proper scale for a room, select a compatible color scheme or even find the type of furniture we like.<ep>
   Besides incorporating existing furnishings into a plan, design professionals also have access to one-of-a-kind furnishings, such as those at the Design Center of the Americas in Dania and the Miami Art & Design District.<ep>
   ``We've had a lot of people come to DCOTA who don't know what a design center is about,'' said Barbara Beltran, a Miami interior designer. ``They thought they were getting a deal. That's not the case. What you get is unique furnishings not available in the retail market.''<ep>
   Many designers, such as Alex Channing, whose Acquisitions showroom is in the Miami design district, design furniture as well as interiors. ``We do custom work and have a full-service library,'' Channing said.<ep>
   Among the unique things he has designed is an Art Deco-style entertainment unit with a TV lift. Now he's working on an iron ornamentation for a limestone fireplace.<ql>
<m1>Terminology varies<ep>
<m0>   Only state-licensed individuals may call themselves ``interior designers.'' Unlicensed design practitioners may call themselves decorators, design consultants, space planners, etc., and they may have years of experience and great taste. In fact, ``decorator'' carries a certain cache in places like New York, where Mario Buatta, designer to the rich and famous, calls himself a decorator.<ep>
   Designers may also belong to organizations (--) such as the American Society of Interior Designers or the Interior Design Guild of South Florida (--) that maintain professional standards and require continuing education.<ep>
    Once you decide to hire a designer, the next thing is to find one you can work with for possibly a long time.<ep>
   ``I can't think of anything more important than rapport between the designer and the client,'' said Dorothy DeSaulnier, a Fort Lauderdale designer. ``People must understand that the first designer they meet may not be the one they will end up working with.''<ep>
   ``I think consumers should interview at least a couple of designers,'' said Ivette A. Planas of Ivette Arango Interiors in the Miami design district. ``Each of us has a different way of working. You have to have an open line of communication. In my 22 years in business, I don't think I've had a client I couldn't work with. You have to be flexible and accommodate the client. You have to guide the client with a lot of tenderness.''<ep>
   ``I think the first thing in developing a designer-client relationship is trust,'' said Mary Jane Reeves of MJR Interiors in Coral Gables. ``In today's climate, it's not always so easy to achieve.''<ql>
<m1>Budget isn't always clear<ep>
<m0>   Trust can be fleeting if the client is not totally honest about what he can spend.<ep>
   ``Sometimes people don't want to discuss their budget because they think the designer will spend up to the budget,'' Reeves said. ``That's not always true. A designer has to have an idea of what the client can spend or is willing to spend.''<ep>
   ``There's not a client that will come in and state his budget,'' said Planas. ``They want to see what you can do before they tell you what they can spend.''<ep>
   John Berenson, of John Berenson Interior Design in the Miami design district, said clients sometimes have ``unrealistic expectations'' because they haven't worked with a designer before.<ep>
   ``They may expect a $1,000 chair to perform, look and feel like a $2,000 chair,'' he said. ``I try to get them the best value for the dollar.''<ql>
<m1>Setting compensation<ep>
<m0>   The designer must also be honest about fees and compensation. Designers charge for their work in various ways, including a flat fee for the project, an hourly fee, a percentage of the total design budget, or by the square foot.<ep>
   Designers may also work on a ``cost-plus'' plan. With this method, the client pays the wholesale price (called ``net'' in the business) plus a predetermined percentage markup. That is, the client pays the designer's actual cost plus a commission for the services. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Some designers will buy furnishings at wholesale and charge their clients the retail price, pocketing the difference for their service.<ep>
   Because of the complexity of the business, it's not unusual for a designer to use more than one method of compensation.<ep>
   Reeves, for example, uses two methods.<ep>
   ``I charge by the hour for designing, then charge cost-plus if I do the buying,'' she said. ``Most of my overhead cost is due to purchasing, insurance, risk. When there are problems, they are mine because I'm responsible.''<ql>
<m1>The purchasing role<ep>
<m0>   Purchasing for a client can be the most time-consuming and tiring service a designer offers. ``And most clients want the designer to do the purchasing because they don't have the time to do it. And they don't want the responsibility if something goes wrong,'' Reeves said.<ep>
   Fred Sargent, president of the American Society of Interior Designers' South Florida chapter and a designer in the Jupiter firm of H. Allen Holmes, said hourly fees of South Florida designers average about $100, while flat fees for design services range from $1,000 to $1,500.<ep>
   ``If we're dealing with new construction, fees can go up to $25,000 or $50,000,'' Sargent said. ``If we sit in an architect's office researching all kinds of hardware, windows, doors, it can take a long time. I once spent a year in a trailer [on a construction site] to make sure everything was done correctly.''<ep>
   There are many projects (--) such as building a custom home or doing a major renovation (--) that require an architect's services. Interior designers like to be ``on board'' early in a project so that there is coordination among architect, designer and client. Some architectural firms have interior designers on staff; others contract with design firms for large projects.<ep>
   Architect Roney J. Mateu, of Mateu Carreno Rizo & Partners of Coral Gables, said he's willing to work with an interior designer if a client wants to include one in a project.<ep>
   ``Architects do interior design, too,'' he said. ``In our firm, we design houses as a complete thing, from the concept to the finishes. As an architect, I find it difficult to separate where architecture ends and interior design begins.''<m1><ep>
<m0>   Like interior designers, architects also charge for their services in several ways. They may negotiate a lump-sum fee for an expected budget, they may charge a percentage of the construction cost, or they may charge for time and materials.<ql>
