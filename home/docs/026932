   Wallpaper borders are growing, to as wide as 12 to 20 inches.<ep>
   ``Big borders'' can give a room a regal flair. When paired with a smaller border, they can create a custom look. Used in place of crown moldings, big borders put a finishing touch on a wall.<ep>
   Two of the newer collections of big borders are titled Maximus and Serenity, produced by Gloria Merrill Enterprises, a Long Island wall-covering company.<ep>
   The theme of these large borders is drawn from the tropical rain forests of the Amazon, the exotic character of the Orient and the majestic beauty of Africa's wild animals.<ep>
   Easy to hang, many borders are prepasted and strippable for no-fuss application and removal. Even the most novice do-it-yourselfer can be artistic with borders.<ep>
   Here are some ideas for creating beautiful rooms with borders:<ep>
   (box) Use borders just below a ceiling instead of a crown molding.<ep>
   (box) Frame doors and windows for architectural detailing.<ep>
   (box) Create a chair rail by running borders around a room at waist level. For a wainscoting effect, hang coordinating wall coverings above and below the border.<ep>
   (box) Use oversize borders to ``hide'' unattractive soffits.<ep>
   (box) Create a headboard effect on a wall above a bed.<ep>
   (box) Focus interest on a fireplace with a border placed above the mantel or around the perimeter.<ep>
   (box) Decorate toy boxes, hampers and chests of drawers with borders.<ep>
   (box) ``Panel'' a door with borders.<ep>
   (box) Frame all four walls in borders for a picture-perfect room.<ep>
   (box) Glue borders to staircase risers, then coat with polyurethane.<ep>
   (box) Make coordinating book jackets with oversize borders.<ep>
