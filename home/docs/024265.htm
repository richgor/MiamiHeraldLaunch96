<BR>
A few months ago, we adopted a lovely little German shepherd from the animal shelter. We used to keep her in the house while we were at work, but when we'd come home, the house would be in a shambles. She ate the arm on my couch and my pillows, and ripped the carpet. Scolding doesn't seem to help.<P>

   We keep her in the back yard now, and she has started digging up my bushes. She also has a new habit: growling and giving us love bites when we take her for training (which doesn't work). <P>

   Are there dogs who simply can't be trained, even with love? Are we doing something wrong?<BR>
<BR>
Just as with an adopted child who has had a traumatic past, you can have comparable problems with an adopted dog.<P>

   Her destructiveness when left alone is probably a sign of extreme separation anxiety. It's a cry for help, not behavior that needs to be punished.<P>

   I advise you to get her acclimated to sleeping and eating in an open crate. Then close the crate when you're gone. In time, she'll come to see it as her ``den'' -- her safe haven. Remember to put in a chew toy and a blanket, and also leave a radio or TV on to help her feel less alone.<P>

   She also needs to go to obedience school with you so that you can learn to handle her better. She should look to you not only as a caring friend, but as top dog, too. If the class you tried didn't help, ask your vet to recommend another.<BR>
<BR>
My vet can't stand to see collars on cats. He once actually cut the collar off my cat when I brought her in for a routine exam.<P>

   Presently, I have an indoor cat. My vet sternly told me not to put a collar on her. When I said I wanted a photo of her in a fancy collar, he said not to leave it on for more than an hour.<P>

   I usually do what he tells me. But what's so dangerous about a collar?<BR>
<BR>
Your vet has probably seen the consequences of cats wearing the wrong kind of collar. I, too, would cut a flea collar off any animal that came to me. Imagine wearing a plastic strip around your neck that keeps emitting a pesticide vapor that you breathe in and absorb through your skin.<P>

   As for nonpesticide collars, indoor cats sometimes get a claw hooked into or under their collars and can't get free. This can happen with dogs, also, when they play and one gets a tooth or claw snagged in the other's collar.<P>

   Also, outdoor cats have been known to choke to death or incur serious injuries when their collars get caught on wire fences or broken tree branches. Since all cats who go outdoors should wear an ID tag, the solution is to buy a breakaway collar. These special collars have an elastic strip inserted that enables the wearer to pull its head free in an emergency.<BR>
<BR>
We have been told that our dog of eight years has Cushing's disease and that it has to do with his liver. Could you explain a little more about it?<BR>
<BR>
Cushing's disease is a disease of the hormone or endocrine system. It has nothing to do with the liver; it affects the adrenal glands. It's a disease that cannot be cured, but with supportive treatment, your dog's life can be made more comfortable.<P>

   If your veterinarian really said it was due to liver disease, you should get further clarification concerning treatment. If the explanation is unsatisfactory, seek another opinion.<P>

   Many canine diseases of the endocrine systems are complex, and often more than one disease is present, leading to a general weakening of the animal's condition and increased susceptibility to infections.<BR>
<BR>
We've had our golden retriever for 13 years, and he's just like a member of our family. About three years ago, I noticed that one of his ears was very swollen. The vet said it was a hematoma (swollen with blood), and aspirated it, but two days later, it was back again.<P>

   So then he operated on our dog's veins. This was successful, until a month ago when the ear swelled again, requiring further surgery. However, this time the surgery did not work.<P>

   Now the ear is still swollen, and there's a tube in it to drain the blood. I fear more surgery, since our dog is so old. Do you have any advice?<BR>
<BR>
I presume he's not scratching and shaking his head because of a chronic ear infection -- the most common cause of hematoma of the ear. Make sure he has no such underlying problem.<P>

   Certainly, it would be best to avoid unnecessary surgery since it would mean putting your old dog at risk. If your dog isn't uncomfortable, I would not subject him to another operation. Left alone, the swelling will eventually harden, shrink and leave your dog with a twisted, shriveled ear. It won't be too unsightly since the long hair over his ear will help cover the deformity.<P>

   Dogs sometimes develop ear hematomas after they've been playing too roughly or after they have been bitten on the ear in a fight. Immediate surgical intervention, before the blood clot starts to harden, usually corrects the problem. Your dog was one of the unlucky ones.<BR>
<BR>
Recently my cat began breathing through his mouth, but since he seemed fine otherwise -- he continued to eat and drink a normal amount -- I didn't take him to the vet right away. By the time I did take him in, his sides were heaving as he drew breath and he died at the vet's of cardiac arrest while they were trying to take X-rays.<P>

   After his death, the vet drew fluid from my cat's chest and said a bacterial infection had led to the breathing problems and enlarged heart.<P>

   I had never realized the seriousness of open-mouth breathing, and feel terrible now. Why didn't I get him a checkup sooner?<P>

   I hope my letter will prevent your readers from making the same mistake I did in thinking that if a cat eats and drinks, he's not sick.<BR>
<BR>
Why should a perfectly healthy cat succumb so quickly to a bacterial infection? Something must have weakened his immune system.<P>

   Although he seemed normal, it's likely that he had some heart abnormality that led to a buildup of fluid in his chest. He may have been suffering from chronic myocardial hypertrophy, a condition of unknown origin that causes the heart to enlarge and prevents it from functioning properly.<P>

   Was he tested for a virus infection, such as feline leukemia? Unusual diseases can develop sometimes after pets have been vaccinated -- a condition called vaccinosis.<BR>
Q.<BR>
My Norwegian elkhound is perfect in every way except that she sheds excessively year-round, even though I brush her every day. Within an hour, the bedding is covered with her hair.<P>

   Daily, I give her garlic, yeast tablets and two Lipoderm gel capsules, which are said to reduce shedding, but have not. Help.<BR>
<BR>
Some dogs shed constantly, and I mean constantly -- regardless of the season. <P>

   If your dog's skin is normal -- not dry and flaky, or oily and scaly -- then it's unlikely that the nutrient supplements you give her will ever reduce the shedding. You'll have to live with it just as the rest of us do who have ``shedful dogs.''<BR>
