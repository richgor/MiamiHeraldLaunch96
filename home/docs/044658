<m0>   Mehdi and Alexandra bought a vacation condominium at a Florida resort. The condo association offered a guaranteed lease program where the association pays condo owners $21,000 annual rent plus 40 percent of gross rents exceeding $52,500 annually. Mehdi and Alexandra signed up for the rental program.<ep>
   The owners occupied the condo for 27 days during the tax year. On their income tax return, they deducted applicable rental expenses, such as insurance, maintenance, depreciation and utilities.<ep>
   However, the Internal Revenue Service denied any loss deduction exceeding the $21,000 rent income. The IRS argued that Mehdi's and Alexandra's 27 days in the condo were more than 10 percent of the 200 rental days, so their expenses are limited to $21,000.<ep>
   If you were the judge, would you allow Mehdi and Alexandra to deduct rental expenses exceeding their rental income?<ep>
   The judge said yes.<ep>
   The condo association's guaranteed annual rent program was a fair market rent for the entire 365-day year, the judge said. Since Mehdi's and Alexandra's 27-day occupancy was not more than 10 percent of the 365 days the condo was available for rent, the tax law allows them to deduct all applicable expenses, including depreciation, he ruled.<ep>
   Based on the recent U.S. Court of Appeals decision in Razavi vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 74 Fed.3d 125.<ql>
