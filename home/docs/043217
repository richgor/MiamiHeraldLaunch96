<m0>   <m0>Dear Ann: <m0>As a longtime reader, I am aware that you are against anyone violating the confidentiality of adoption records in order to trace family members. How right you are. Please hold fast to your position. It is morally sound. The following Associated Press item appeared in the Lorain, Ohio, Morning Journal, Jan. 8, 1996.<ql>
<m0>Cleveland<qr>

<m0>   Thanks for sending the story. Here it is:<ep>
   ``Doylestown, Pa. (--) Carol Sandusky didn't want to hear how her biological father supposedly stabbed her mother with an ice pick and threw her out a window while she was pregnant with Carol.<ep>
   ``She didn't want to know she was beaten in the face with a saucepan and burned with cigarettes as a toddler. She didn't want to hear that her biological family members accuse each other of rape, murder, beatings and infidelity.<ep>
   ``Sandusky, 26, learned the details because a government caseworker violated her wishes (--) and the law (--) by helping a sister track her down. What's worse, she said, the same agency might have saved her from a tormented adolescence had it disclosed the abuse to Jeanne and Thomas Sandusky when they adopted Carol in 1973 at the age of 3 1/2.<ep>
   `` `The state made a decision to take me out of this environment, then they decided 20 years later to bring it back to me,' Sandusky said. `My file was supposed to be really private.'<ep>
   ``In telling her story and advocating privacy laws, Sandusky stands among the few trying to counter a movement promoting vigorous searches for birth families. She rejects the arguments of those, including her biological sister, who believe she's not dealing with her adoption and must hear the grisly details to heal emotionally.<ep>
   `` `They thought this information was going to help me. I wasn't even born yet. What's this information going to do for me?' Sandusky said.<ep>
   ``Sandusky, her parents and her husband recently filed a federal lawsuit against the Cumberland County Children and Youth Services administrator, Gary I. Shuey, and the person she blames for improperly revealing sealed information, former agency caseworker Marlene Bohr. [The Sanduskys] contend the agency violated [Carol's] privacy and fraudulently withheld information that would have led her adoptive parents to seek therapy for her years earlier.<ep>
   ``In Pennsylvania, adoptees may obtain information about their birth parents with the consent of a court and the parents, but the law forbids agencies from opening records to siblings. Most states have restrictions on adoption records.<ep>
   ``Bohr did not return messages left on her home answering machine, and Shuey didn't return calls to his office. Ruby D. Weeks, attorney for the youth agency, referred calls to county solicitor Hank Johnson, who said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment.<ep>
   ``Sandusky's ordeal started in February 1992, two months after her wedding.''<ep>
   <m0>Dear Readers: <m0>This is Ann. That news story made me so angry my blood pressure must have leaped at least 100 points. How about yours?<ep>
   Can you imagine the emotional trauma of the young woman whose privacy was invaded and how she must feel having all those lurid details made public? We're rooting for you, Carol.<ql>
