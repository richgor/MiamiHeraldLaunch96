<m0>  Stimulating, exciting, vibrant, hot, cool, subdued, soothing, reticent. . . these are characteristics of color in the garden.<ep>
  At the Color Conference of 1996, held last week at Fairchild Tropical Garden, various opinions emerged on what was garish and what was gaudy and what was otherwise suitably subtle and warm.<ep>
  One issue that did not get any argument was the big demand for color in South Florida gardens.<ep>
  Landscape designers, horticultural consultants and gardeners in the full-house audience got a preview of new annual color for next winter from Carol Troendle with Ball Seed; they heard Bob Armstrong from Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania talk about past and future sources of garden color that researchers are working on now; they saw some updated old favorites, such as crotons and ti plants that are coming back from exile and being used in new ways.<ep>
  The details:<ep>
   Carol Troendle, just back from viewing flower and seed producers' new wares, brought word of what Ball Seed will have available for Caribbean and South Florida commercial flower growers in the next four to six months.<ep>
  (box) Alyssum, a low-growing border plant with heads of light-colored flowers that are sometimes called sweet alyssum because of their fragrance, will appear in darker colors of pink and deep pink.<ep>
  (box) Wax begonias will be shorter and covered with more flowers in pink and red.<ep>
  (box) New lines of geraniums, which do well in South Florida from October to May, were tested in California and Florida, and two types that Troendle likes for the subtropics are those called Designer, with medium green leaves and colors described as hot pink and pink pearl, and the Showcase line with dark green leaves that tolerate more heat.<ep>
   (box) Impatiens will come in an array of new colors. One new series, called Stars, has two-tone stripes resembling, for some unknown reason, some kinds of petunias. New patterns are more stable, Troendle said. Still another type of impatiens has been bred to show a light netting or stripes in the petals; these are called Accent Mosiac impatiens.<ep>
  (box) New Guinea impatiens that hold up better in summer conditions will come in new flower colors, such as light pink and grape crush.<ep>
  (box) Petunias in the Dreams series are resistant to botrytis or gray mold, and will grow a good 18 inches from the center. A new one called Purple Wave is being used ``all over the place'' in Atlanta for the Olympics, she said.<ep>
  (box) Portulaca, a succulent ground-hugging plant with bright dots of flowers that once opened only in the morning, have been bred to keep flowers open for up to 10 hours. Look for a color called Mango.<ep>
  (box) Raspberry Red vincas, or periwinkles, are new. Plant them before the rainy season to avoid fungus, Troendle advised.<ql>

<m0>  Miami nurseryman Tim Anderson touted the landscape uses of begonias, which offer colorful foliage on some varieties and showy flowers on others.<ep>
  Anderson said the challenge of begonias in South Florida was that ``they like a lot of water on the dry side.'' That means their planting beds must drain perfectly, yet retain moisture around the fragile roots, he said.<ep>
  ``The best growing conditions are on wet rocks,'' he noted. ``Their roots need constant air, but they also need to stay moist all the time.''<ep>
  Anderson advised against using muck or even 50-50 muck and sand because bacteria, fungi and nematodes in the media can kill begonias. Residents of Dade with rocky soil should just ``fluff'' it and plant begonias directly in it, Anderson said. Gardeners with mucky soil could add Lake Wales sand or pea rock to aid in drainage.<ep>
  Slow-release fertilizers make it possible to grow robust begonias, Anderson said. ``The quality of slow-release fertilizer is constantly improving and longer-lasting. Get one that lasts six to 12 months,'' so the plants have a steady supply of nutrients available to them, he said.<ql>

<m0>  First, design a garden. Then determine where colorful leaves could be placed. That is the advice of Plantation horticultural consultant Derek Burch.<ep>
  ''Colored foliage is there all the time,'' he said. ``It can be very powerful or garish.''<ep>
  Or, it could be put to good use to show off other plants, such as the dark, wine-colored Acalypha accenting green cycads, as occurs in a courtyard at Fairchild.<ep>
  A rule of thumb: ``If you are combining strong color with less strong, you should have twice as much of the less strong.''<ep>
  Burch suggested additional uses for colorful foliage: as a bright light to pull the eye toward a view, such as at the end of a vista; as a feature by itself, without competing color; as part of a whole palette all within the same impact, such as soft gray shrubbery behind soft pink flowers that are accented with cream and green spider plants.<ep>
  ''If a leaf has more than one color,'' Burch said, ``it makes the texture appear finer, smaller.''<ql>

<m0>   Croton aficionado Bob Haehle, Fort Lauderdale horticultural consultant and writer, brought an unrestrained enthusiasm for the gaudiest of crotons to the conference.<ep>
  ``Crotons are tough,'' he said. ``They've been out of favor since the mid-1960s, but we're seeing a comeback. They're survivors; even with the worst of care they pull through.''<ep>
   Malaysian in origin, crotons can be used as specimens, but are better used in groups, he said.<ep>
  ``Do not use them as foundation plantings,'' Haehle said, ``they can grow to 15 feet. The eaves will prevent them from getting rain, and thrips and spider mites are pests that love dry conditions.''<ep>
  Crotons do best in dappled shade, and they reach their peak of color from October through January, he said.<ep>
  Samples of cuttings Haehle passed around included: Tiger Eye, black-red background with red spots; Golden Glow, yellow and pale pink spots and stripes on green and red; Mona Lisa, with a predominance of yellow for a dark, shady corner; Fred Sanders, green and yellow in an oak leaf shape; Gloriosa, a big leaf with pink and red coloration; William Craig, with apricot, deep red and yellow.<ep>
   When they age, some crotons get leggy, showing bare lower stems. For this, Haehle suggests ``modesty panels to cover their bare shanks.'' That is, use low-growing plants in front of them to hide the stems but not the leaves. Try liriope.<ep>
