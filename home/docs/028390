<m0>EARTHNOTES<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>For a rather<m0> flattened sphere, the Earth has done a remarkable thing: turned a corner. Have you noticed?<ep>
  The allamanda is flowering again, and the cycads have flushed new crowns of still-soft leaves. From the depths of the bromeliad's rosette, another rosette arises, an imperious flower stalk soon to stretch its vainglorious neck.<ep>
   Mahogany leaves, red at birth, are among the forest's finest, lightest green when new. Caladium leaves unroll from spear-like shoots, unbidden and thought lost. Eyes on the cattleyas' pseudobulbs have swollen into buds and now into fingerlings.<ep>
  Ants are milking the aphids on the citrus trees, poking them and prodding, encouraging the secretion of honeydew, anointing the season of growth.<ql>
<m0>SPECIAL ACTIVITIES<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  <m0>Take cuttings.<m0> Make air layers. Repot the orchids, and those plants that have so filled their containers with roots they require watering every day.<ep>
  ``Propagation by cuttings is less thrilling than graftage and involves no magic,'' wrote Collette, author of Gigi and other tales. ``And yet I never became complacent about the moment in my garden when the cutting that has lost consciousness and seems to be succumbing to the brutal incision decides to live, reopens its green canals to the rising sap, and draws itself up <m4> BEGIN LEG #2 <m0>with little, imperceptible twitches. . . .''<ep>
    Take tip cuttings of healthy plants such as allamanda and bougainvillea, carissa, coleus, crotons, dracaenas, hibiscus, orange jasmine, pentas, impatiens. Don't be afraid to experiment.<ep>
  Cuttings may be several inches long. Remove the lower leaves, and insert at least two or three nodes into a damp mixture of equal parts peat moss and perlite. You may use root-promoting hormones if you wish, and some contain fungicide to protect against rot, but in our climate you don't have to.<ep>
   If the leaves at the top are large, you may wish to snip them in half to keep the plant from losing too much water while trying to produce roots. Keep in shade, keep moist, keep your spirits up, and keep the plantlets protected from wind.<ep>
  Maintain high humidity. You may wish to put several cuttings in a community pot, or single cuttings in individual pots. You may also want to put the pot or pots in plastic bags, closed with a twist, to ensure high humidity. If you wait until the rainy season starts, you can get away without the plastic.<ep>
  Roots will begin forming within a few days, and within a few weeks, you should be able to acclimate the rooted cuttings gradually to more light and finally to the real world.<ep>
  To air layer a ficus or a croton, a dracaena or a hibiscus or other woody plants, select a branch <m4> BEGIN LEG #3 <m0>that is straight and at least a foot long or slightly longer. With a sharp knife, carefully remove a ring of bark, gently scraping the wood clean to avoid formation of new bark instead of roots. You may apply rooting hormone to the area, or not.<ep>
   Take a handful of pre-soaked sphagnum moss and squeeze out the water until the moss is damp and holds together. Then wrap it around the wound on the branch, tying with florist's tape or another material. Wrap the moss in plastic film, tying each end so moisture doesn't escape. (Aluminum foil may cause the sphagnum to get too hot.)<ep>
  After a few weeks, feel the root ball to determine if roots have formed. If you use clear plastic, you will be able to see them. When the ball is full of roots (--) it may take three months or more (--) remove the moss and cut the rooted portion below the roots. Plant them as you would tip cuttings, keeping them steady in their pots so fragile new roots won't be snapped off. Gradually acclimate to more light, hardening them to plant in the landscape.<ql>
<m0>INSECTS<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  <m0>Keep soap and water<m0> handy for dousing the aphids licking like flames up the ends of the new shoots. Use a tablespoon of scentless dish detergent in a gallon of water applied in a strong spray. Repeat as needed. Natural predators include lady beetles, praying mantids.<ep>
  For whiteflies and mealy bugs, <m4> BEGIN LEG #4 <m0>malathion is an old standby, but know that malathion is extremely toxic to bees. Sevin, which kills chewing pests, also kills bees. Orthene and Cygon kill aphids, scale, mealybugs, thrips by getting into the plants' system and poisoning insects when they feed.<ep>
   Begin with benign. Pyrethrin-based organic insecticides are best. Always read directions and apply only to those plants listed on the label.<ep>
   May beetles love white roses, lychees, mamey sapotes, cassias, acacias. They feed at night. So use the old white-bucket-of-water trick, shining a light on the bucket so beetles fly in and drown.<ql>
<m0>LAWNS<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   <m0>Until the rainy season<m0> begins, irrigate well two or three times a week. Run sprinklers early in the morning so the roots will not be stressed before the sun hits the midday sky. Deep watering encourages deep roots, and they, in turn, are less susceptible to drought.<ep>
   Orchids should be on their warm season feeding schedule: a balanced liquid fertilizer applied at half strength every two weeks. If you are repotting, remember to place newly repotted orchids in a darker than usual area, and keep them on the dry side until new roots form.<ql>
<m0>LOOK FOR<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>  <m0>Silver linings.<m0> And wonderful large mahogany trees to get an idea of how big they can get before you plant them too close together.<ql>
