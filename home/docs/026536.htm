By GEORGE KARVEL<BR>
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Service<BR>
<BR>
Residential bathrooms are often given numerical descriptions -- such as half bath -- on the basis of number and type of plumbing fixtures. How is the designation determined and where did this system originate?<BR>
<BR>
I have no idea where it got started, but here are the accepted definitions:<P>

   <LI> Full bath. Toilet, sink and tub (there's no standard for shower heads).<P>

   <LI> One-half bath. Toilet and sink.<P>

   In some areas, although not in South Florida, another term is added: the three-quarter bath, with toilet, sink and shower stall.<BR>
<BR>
I am self-employed and show a low income. It is my dream to own a $80,000 to $90,000 home. I know I can afford a $700-a-month payment. My credit is good and I have $12,000 in savings. But I can't get preapproval for a loan of more than $36,000. Is there any hope for me?<BR>
<BR>
Eligibility for a mortgage is based on income. To buy an $80,000 home with a $12,000 down payment requires a $68,000 mortgage. A loan at 8 percent interest and repaid over 30 years would require a monthly payment of $498.98. To qualify for a loan of this amount, you would need a gross annual income of about $24,000.<P>

   To have the home of your dreams, given your available down payment, you need to increase your earnings. Alternately, you could make a larger down payment so your income matches the loan amount for which you can qualify. In your case you need to save an additional $32,000.<P>

   Or you could buy a $48,000 home.<BR>
<BR>
I was getting ready to sign a purchase agreement for a 40-acre parcel of land when the seller suddenly withdrew his offer to sell. I had decided to accept his $17,500 counteroffer when the seller's broker found out the timber on the land was valued at more than $36,000.<P>

   I contended I should be able to sign the counteroffer, forcing the seller to sell me the land for $17,500. Can a seller legally cancel a purchase offer after it has been delivered to the prospective buyer?<BR>
<BR>
The seller and/or his broker had the right to withdraw the counteroffer anytime before you signed it. <P>

   Had the broker not informed the seller of the timber appraisal, he or she could have lost her license and been held liable for any losses suffered by the seller.<BR>
<BR>
I'm an inmate in an Indiana prison. I recently learned that while my grandmother was sick and thinking she might not survive, she conveyed some land to me.<P>

   After my grandmother recovered, she told me that she had hired a lawyer in 1976 to convey one-fifth of her land in Mississippi to me. I asked her why it took so long for her to tell me about the land, and she said the lawyer assured her he would send me the transfer deed.<P>

   I have since discovered that the property was leased by an oil company, which was paying royalties to the owners. I discovered that the lawyer hired by my grandmother claims to own the land through adverse possession.<P>

   I have what seems to be proof that my grandmother never sold the land. Do I have a claim?<BR>
<BR>
You have legitimate questions that deserve answers. To determine how your grandmother's property ended up in her lawyer's name you need to examine the chain of title, which is a history of ownership.<P>

   Contact a title insurance or abstract company or attorney in the county where the property is located. Ask for a copy of the abstract, or ask the company to examine and report all mortgage, liens, leases and conveyances beginning with your grandmother's ownership.<P>

   You can help in the search if you can provide a legal description of the property. You may also consider contacting the local bar association for pro bono legal services if you cannot afford to hire professional assistance.<P>

   A claim of adverse possession would not prevail if you can show that title was acquired by treachery, deceit and/or fraud.<BR>
<BR>
My wife and I are both 46 and have been dairy farmers for 20 years. Last year we learned the state plans to build a new four-lane highway in 2002 that would take our house, barn and silos. What should we do?<BR>
<BR>
You need a lawyer and an appraiser. If the state moves ahead with the highway project, it will need to acquire all or part of your farm. If you are unwilling to sell, the state will proceed with a condemnation action.<P>

   My advice is not to enter into any agreement until the structures and land are properly appraised. The appraisal should be conducted by someone experienced in condemnation valuation. Also, you will find that a condemnation attorney can negotiate and represent your interests better than you.<P>

   When property is taken for a public purpose, you are entitled to be fully compensated. Although entities with the right of eminent domain purport to offer full compensation, my experience is that the offer is usually less than fair market value.<BR>
<BR>
I own a lake cottage with my brothers. We built it ourselves in 1980. Now, we want to sell it, but because we kept few receipts we are having trouble determining its cost and, subsequently, what the capital gain will be. Any suggestions?<BR>
<BR>
A call to the Internal Revenue Service about your situation revealed a rather rigid position. Without any actual receipts, the IRS will consider your basis (original cost) to be zero. That means you would have to pay capital gains on the entire sale amount.<P>

   You should gather what receipts you have and try to reconstruct the other costs. The IRS will let you know if it doesn't accept your calculation.<P>

   To estimate the original cost, you may need an appraiser. Ask the appraiser to determine the cost of building the cottage today. Using the Consumer Price Index, you can adjust today's cost to estimate the cost at the time you built the cottage. If you don't know how to use the CPI, an accountant should be able to make the calculation and provide additional ways to address the problem.<P>

   The lesson for readers building or making improvements to a home is to retain all records supporting the cost of construction. You will need them even if you sell the home many years later.<BR>
<BR>
Our house has a city sanitary sewer line running under the attached garage (which has had a bedroom added over it) and a storm sewer under part of the living room, which was expanded from a former sun porch. We've been told that if we sold the property, the location of the sewers might prevent buyers from getting a mortgage. It will cost us more than $20,000 to reroute the sewers. What should we do?<BR>
<BR>
Have an attorney examine your abstract to determine if the city has a proper easement for the sewer lines. If there is a flaw in the easement, you may be able to force the city to move the lines at its expense.<P>

   Another issue depends on when the sewer lines were installed and the home built. If the city granted building permits for the original house, for converting the sun porch to a living room and converting the garage to a living space after the sewers were installed, it also may have some liability in the event the structures are damaged.<P>

   An attorney can assist you in negotiating a resolution to your problem, which could include sharing the cost of moving the sewers with the city.<BR>
