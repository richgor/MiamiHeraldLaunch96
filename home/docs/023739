<m0>   Terry Kaplan's career in ceramics began 18 years ago when she made jewelry. Six years ago, she ventured into art tile.<ep>
   Katrina Wolf used to be a quilter, ``but that's not as economically viable as tile.'' Now she makes tile in quilt designs.<ep>
   Kaplan, founder of Terry Tiles in Miami, and Wolf, owner of the Blue Moon Ceramic Tile Studio in Hollywood, were among a dozen or more artisans who exhibited their one-of-a-kind tiles at the recent International Tile & Stone Exposition at the Miami Beach Convention Center.<ep>
   After looking at miles of practical floor and wall tiles, it was refreshing to see the whimsical tiles that evolve from an artist's imagination.<ep>
   Kaplan's popular designs include ``The Key Largo Series,'' a pastel-colored design of beach activities, and ``Stars & Stripes,'' a vibrant primary-colored, whimsical design. Her ``Coffee Cup'' wall hanging is a trio of wildly colored, oversize cups, while her door knobs ($18 to $24) would add pizzazz to any kitchen cabinet. (Kaplan's tiles are distributed by Sunny McLean & Co. in the Miami Art and Design Village.) <m1><ep>
<m0>   Wolf, who distributes her own tile, does custom work that ranges from $4 to $84 per tile. Besides her tile motifs (--) ``You hang them on the wall and never have to launder them'' (--) she makes tiles in mola patterns after the colorful appliques done by the Cuna Indians in the San Blas Islands of Panama.<ep>
   Surving Studios of Middletown, N.Y., a regular exhibitor at the tile show, showed finely crafted three-dimensional ``critters'' (--) lizards, salamanders, sea turtles, tree frogs, geckos and snakes (--) that make interesting borders and inserts for bathrooms and fountains. This year, the studio offered something for hot tub enclosures and bachelor baths (--) female nudes that cost $100 each.<ep>
   Shari Hatchett Bohlmann of SharDan International in Clackamas, Ore., is known as a romance artist who paints charming ``Rooms With a View'' scenes from around the world. Now she's laminating her paintings on a lightweight poly tile that can be hung as a painting or fashioned into a table top. A 3-foot-by-3-foot framed tile picture costs $840.<ep>
   Sylvain Bongard, who lives and works in Portugal, assembles tiles into wall hangings, paints scenes on them, then dismantles them for firing in the kiln. A large wall plaque that could be used as a headboard costs $9,000. Bongard is represented by Rhonda Gelfman Szabo of North Miami Beach.<ql>
