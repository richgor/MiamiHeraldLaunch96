<H2>Ann's favorite letters collected in book</H2>
<!-- end headlines -->
<P>

    Rarely does a day go by that I don't receive at least 50 requests to repeat a specific column.<P>

   ``I should have cut it out,'' writes a reader from Philadelphia, ``but I didn't realize when I read it that I would be in the exact same spot that Wisconsin Woman was in.''<P>

   ``Please, Ann,'' writes Desperate in Detroit, ``run that column about herpes again. For obvious reasons, I can't talk to anyone I know about this. I need the address of the organization that helps people.''<P>

   And here's another one: ``You printed a column about rape last week, and there's a lot of talk about it in the office. I was away on vacation and didn't see it. Can you mail that column to me -- in a plain envelope, please? I think I was raped by a guy I broke up with recently, but I'm not sure.''<P>

   After receiving thousands of letters asking for back columns, it dawned on me that I should gather the ones most frequently requested and put them between hard covers. And that is exactly what I did.<P>

   The book is a collection of what I consider the best columns in my 40 years of writing. If you are a longtime reader, you are sure to recognize some of your favorites -- perhaps the very ones you meant to cut out but didn't. It will be like running into an old friend.<P>

   The most frequently requested column in the collection is ``Dead at Seventeen,'' the essay written from the perspective of a young lad who died in a car crash while driving recklessly and woke up in a morgue. <P>

   Some of the most difficult letters I have had to deal with appear in the chapter ``The Nightmare of Physical Abuse and Rape.'' I'll never forget the letter from the young widowed mother who was beating her 4-year-old son. She wondered whether to give him up for adoption or learn to be a good mother.<P>

   In ``Where in the World Did That Sock Go, and What About My Husband's Shorts?'' you can read about the tissue issue -- the debate over how to hang toilet paper -- and decide whether things are politically correct in your household. You are certain to get a laugh out of the letters in the chapter titled ``Pssst! Want to Buy a Porsche for $50?''<P>

   The other chapters are:<P>

   ``Love, Marriage and the In-Laws From Hell,'' ``Columns from the Bedroom,'' ``Children: A Mixed Blessing -- His, Hers and Ours,'' ``I Love Pets, but an Iguana in the Bathtub?'' ``Straight Talk About Cancer, AIDS and Other Health Problems,'' ``Mental Health: To the Edge and Beyond,'' ``Addictions: The Wrecking Ball of Love, Health and Careers,'' ``Age Is Only a Number, Baby,'' ``Nice Work If You Can Get It,'' ``Bury Me in My 1937 Dodge,'' and ``No B.S., No M.A., No Ph.D., But I Got the J.O.B.''<P>

   The title of the book is Wake Up and Smell the Coffee. The publisher is Villard, a division of Random House. The price is $23. If you cannot locate the book, call (800) 793-2665 to order a copy.<P>

   I would be remiss if I failed to thank the hundreds of editors and publishers who have given me the opportunity to reach their millions of readers. And my thanks to you, who have given me a place at your breakfast tables and made me the arbiter of your family fights. There were times, I'm sure, when my pronouncements were a headache, but I hope I have never been a bore.<BR>
