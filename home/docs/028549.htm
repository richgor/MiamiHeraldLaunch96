isa Lawrence knows the value of renter's insurance. In 1994, burglars broke into her Fort Lauderdale apartment and stole a stereo, TV and other possessions. The thieves were never caught and nothing was recovered -- but her insurance company paid her $8,000 claim within a month.<P>

  Now Lawrence, 32, pays about $300 a year for a policy on her new Coral Springs apartment.<P>

 ``Renter's insurance is important,'' she said. ``You never know what's going to happen. In one robbery or a fire, you can lose everything.''<P>

   The Insurance Information Institute in New York estimates that nationally, 25 percent of tenants carry renter's insurance.<P>

   In South Florida, insurance agents estimate that only 10 to 20 percent of apartment, condo or house renters ever purchase a policy. <P>

   ``We don't have a lot of requests for renter's insurance,'' said Isabelle Morales, an insurance agent with Koski & Co. in Kendall. ``Maybe renters don't know they can get coverage or aren't aware of the bad things that can happen.''<P>

   The fact is, in today's insurance market, most renters in Dade and Broward have little opportunity to shop around for the best policy. And, the choices of coverage are limited, since most private insurers have not been writing renter's insurance policies in South Florida since Hurricane Andrew. <P>

 ``Renter's insurance is a form of property insurance,'' said Leslie Chapman-Henderson, government and community relations specialist at Allstate. ``That means its availability is limited in a marketplace still reeling from Hurricane Andrew. We are not offering renter's insurance to any counties.''<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   A renter who wants private insurance coverage might still be able to obtain a policy as part of a package deal with a current auto, health or life insurance carrier, or get a policy through a business group or other organization. For example, members of the American Association of Retired Persons can obtain renter's insurance from ITT Hartford through their association, Morales said.<P>

   That leaves the state-sponsored Joint Underwriting Association as the primary source for renter's insurance.<P>

   ``Our mission is to provide insurance when people are entitled to coverage but can't get it through a private company,'' said James Newman, executive director of the association. ``We charge premiums. If there are claims, we pay from premiums. If we run out of money we assess insurance companies.''<P>

  Any licensed insurance agent can write a renter's insurance policy for the association, which has about 38,500 renter's policies in Florida, including 5,543 in Dade, 5,668 in Broward, and 4,849 in Palm Beach County, Newman said.<P>

  A typical policy, called an HO-4, generally covers loss of personal possessions from theft, fire, lightning or windstorm. It also provides liability coverage if your dog bites a neighbor, or if a guest slips and falls in your bathroom.<P>

  For a typical policy with a $500 deductible, a renter can expect to pay $200 to $300 a year in premiums, depending on the types and amounts of coverage.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   Unlike a homeowner's policy, renter's insurance doesn't cover the dwelling itself. The landlord is responsible for buying a policy that covers the structure, roof, interior walls and heating/air-conditioning system. <P>

   Such policies are not all-inclusive: If a pipe breaks in the building or a toilet overflows and water ruins your furniture, typically, the landlord's policy would not cover the damages. However, protective devices installed by your landlord -- particularly storm shutters -- may mean a discount on your renter's policy.<P>

  If you have fine jewelry, or an expensive stereo or computer system, you may need to pay an additional premium for extra coverage. And renter's insurance does not cover business property, so if you operate a business in your apartment, you may need to buy a separate policy.<P>

  Most agents recommend a ``replacement-cost'' option. If a fire ruins your worn-out sofa, for instance, a standard policy would pay you the current value -- perhaps $50 -- while a replacement-cost policy would allow you to buy a new sofa that might cost $500.<P>

  For those who live with roommates, each renter needs to purchase a separate policy that covers their own property.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   For renters who want some coverage but have to watch every dollar, one option is purchasing a less comprehensive policy, called a DP-3 or a DP-1. These policies basically cover only fire, lightning and windstorm damage, and exclude theft (a DP-3 offers slightly more coverage than a DP-1). Liability coverage is available with these policies, but only as an option. Because there is no protection against theft, premiums for a DP-3 or DP-1 policy are lower than for an HO-4.<P>

  For example, a typical Dade County renter would pay $137 for a six-month standard HO-4 policy covering $20,000 in personal property and $100,000 in liability, with a $500 deductible, Morales said. In Broward, the cost would be $134; in Palm Beach County, $112. In Monroe County, the premium would be $151. A DP-1 policy with the same coverage limits, but not covering theft, would cost $53 for six months in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. In Monroe, it would be $103.<P>

  While adults need their own policies, college students living away from home but who are financially dependent may be covered by their parents' homeowner policies, up to a certain percentage limit, said Allstate's Chapman-Henderson. For example, a $100,000 homeowner policy with a 10 percent limit on losses that occur outside the home would provide $10,000 in protection to a student's property.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

 ``The best thing to do is to talk about your situation with an insurance agent,'' Chapman-Henderson said. ``Look at your belongings and evaluate what you have to lose. No one should make a decision based on generic guidelines. You need to get the specifics for your situation.''<P>

  As if the choices for renter's insurance weren't already limited, the Joint Underwriting Association has imposed severe restrictions on issuing new renter's insurance policies. For example, the association will only offer HO-4 coverage to tenants within 90 days of beginning or renewing a lease, according to Morales. The association will also extend coverage if you have been dropped by your current private insurer. In other cases, it will offer a DP-3 or DP-1 policy, Morales said.<P>

 ``The JUA is the only thing there is out there now,'' said Alan Joseph, Fort Lauderdale agent for Mutual of Omaha. ``Thank God for them, because I don't know what would have happened without the JUA.''<BR>

   <LI> Get replacement-cost coverage, which will let you buy a new sofa or stereo, rather than actual-value coverage, which will provide only the depreciated value.<P>

   <LI> Review theft limits, and purchase additional coverage if necessary. For instance, many policies only cover jewelry losses of $1,000. <P>

   <LI> Get ``loss of use'' coverage, if possible. If your building is destroyed, this would cover your temporary living expenses. <P>

   <LI> Find out if your policy covers your possessions away from home (in a car, when traveling or in storage) and the limits of that coverage.<P>

   <LI> Ask if a discount is available for storm shutters, burglar alarms or other safety equipment. <P>

   <LI> Document your possessions with photos, videotape or inventory.<BR>
