<m0>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>I live in a three-story condo. Every two or three years, we have to get a plumber to clean out the sewer drain that runs from our apartment and two others. Management will not pay the costs. Isn't the problem one the association should take care of?<ql>
<m0>J.S.,<m0> Clearwater<qr>

<m2><ql>
<m0>Yes, a sewer pipe that serves multiple units is usually a ``common element'' of the building and the responsibility of the association to maintain (including cleaning when needed), unless excluded by the declaration in your condo association documents.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>Three years ago, I inherited a condo apartment to rent out, not live in. Looking at our association bylaws, I am led to believe that since I have had the apartment rented for three years, I am no longer allowed to rent out the unit. Enclosed is a copy of our bylaws for your opinion.<ql>
<m0>R.H., <m0>Pembroke Pines<m0><qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>The way I read your bylaws, it looks as if they say you can rent out your apartment under the following conditions: a minimum lease period of three months, maximum lease period of one year, and you may do either of those things only every fourth year.<ep>
  Most associations have a 30-day minimum instead of a 90-day. And I think a one-year max is OK, but only if it can be approved for additional one-year extensions. I have no problem with a once-per-year rental restriction, but every fourth may be a bit skimpy.<ep>
  Since your association does permit leasing, I am not sure how the once-every-fourth-year clause would hold up if it had to go to court.<ql>
<m2><ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>I am chairman of the legal committee of our condo. We have 25 unit owners who have carpet glued to their patio decks. The experts tell us this creates a hazard and causes the concrete to crumble, yet these unit owners refuse to remove their carpeting. After due notice, can we enter those apartments and remove the carpet and charge the cost to the unit owner?<ql>
<m0>L.B., <m0>Ft. Lauderdale<m0><ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>Several condo managers I talked with indicated that the most they were advised to do was pass, and enforce, rules that prohibit the installation of new carpeting on balconies once the old is removed for any reason.<ep>
  Forcing compliance on your holdouts without going to court may depend on proving the overall extent of damage actually being found.<ep>
  In a court case (Cedar Grove), the argument was not whether carpeting caused a problem but whether the repair could be considered a common expense as opposed to personal expense. I expect your problem is similar, and only your association's legal counsel should advise you which way to go.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>A new bylaw provision requires members of our board of directors to take a one-year hiatus from service every six years. Some folks think the new rule should apply to present directors who have been sitting for several years, while others think the new bylaw would apply only to terms of service starting now. Who is correct?<ql>
<m0>C.P., <m0>Boca Raton<m0><qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>I have the feeling that the bylaw was passed, in part at least, to break up the present group of governors. I do not think you can make this rule retroactive. In other words, starting <m0>now, <m0>after six years of future service, a director must take a year off.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>We have a 72-unit condo complex. Our problem is how to prevent new buyers from moving in before they are authorized by the association. Are there any ways of preventing people from bypassing our board authorization?<ql>

<m0>Restrictions on the sale and transfer of condo units are recognized and permitted by the Condominium Act (718.104(5)F.S.).<ep>
  ``These restrictions are recognized as enforceable by Florida courts as long as they are for a lawful purpose and are reasonable,'' according to Peter M. Dunbar, in his text, <m0>Condominium Concept.<m0>  <m1><ep>
<m0>   The review process can also be used by the board to ensure that new residents have been provided a full set of the condo documents and the required Q&A sheet. If your declaration calls for this transfer approval, signed by the board of the association, then the title company should not close on the unit until they get it. Sorry, no lockouts and no electricity disconnects.<ql>

<m0>Many folks are still not aware that homeowner associations are not the same as condos or co-ops. The laws governing them are not the same, and the Bureau of Condominium has no regulatory power over them.<ep>
  To get a set of the two major laws governing homeowner association corporations (F.S. 607 and 617), you must send a check for $10, made out to the Secretary of State, to the Bureau of Administrative Code, 401 S. Monroe St., Elliot Building, Tallahassee, Fla. 32399-0250.<ep>
   If you are the manager or president of a homeowner association, I recommend that you buy the desktop reference by William D. Clark, published by Revere Legal Publishers, $60. The book is loose-leaf, and semi-annual updates are available. Call (800) 262-1776 for particulars.<ql>

<m0>Q.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>The rules used for our swimming pool date to 1980. Are there any universal rules governing pools and their usage? <m1><ql>
<m0>D.K., <m0>Hollywood<m0><qr>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m0>Requirements under the law are not as complete as you might think. Florida's Administrative Code (10-5.137) (7), which governs supervision and safety of pools, requires the following:<ep>
  Rules and regulations for bathers shall be posted in minimum one-inch letters, which must be legible from the pool deck, and shall contain a ban on food, drink and animals; capacity; hours; and a requirement to shower before entering.<ep>
  Additional rules may be posted, and that pools without an approved diving-well configuration shall have ``NO DIVING'' in four-inch letters included with the rules.<ep>
  Check with your local health department pool inspector for additional requirements or recommendations. (Wading and spa pools have other regulations.)<ql>
