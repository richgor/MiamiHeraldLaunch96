<m0>   Years ago, only the wealthy hired an interior designer.<ep>
   Today, people can find qualified designers on staff at department and furniture stores and design centers.<ep>
   ``The design diva is gone,'' said Maria Ecks, divisional director of home sales and marketing for Burdines. ``Interior design used to be elitist. Twenty years ago, it began to change. Now it's available to a larger number of people.''<ep>
   What are the advantages of a store design service?<ep>

<m0>store. Some offer free design service; others charge a consultation fee or a retainer. Some expect clients to buy all of their furnishings at that store; others will shop outside the store, particularly for goods they don't carry.<ep>
   Burdines, which has had a design studio for 35 years, offers design services at four of its 43 stores: Dadeland Home Store, Furniture Gallery in South Dade, Coral Square Mall in Coral Springs and Town Center Mall in Boca Raton. There are 23 designers on staff; 98 percent are licensed by the state, Ecks said.<ep>
   The design process starts with the customer calling one of these four stores for an appointment with a designer. During the first interview, the designer asks about the customer's priorities, needs and budget.<ep>
   The customer pays a $75 consultation fee, which is credited upon the purchase of $1,500 in furnishings. A fee of $150 an hour is charged if the client doesn't intend to buy at the store.<ep>
   ``We may do just one room or an entire house for a client,'' Ecks said. ``But no matter how large or small the job, we always ask clients about their short- or long-term planning. They may want to do the master suite now and six months from now the family room. The project can be better coordinated if there's an overall plan.''<ql>
<m1>Homework for clients<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   After the initial meeting at the store, the Burdines designer visits the client's home to learn more about the family's lifestyle, the traffic pattern, and likes and dislikes of household members.<ep>
   Next, the client is assigned ``homework.''<ep>
   ``We ask clients to tear pictures out of magazines of things they like,'' Ecks said. ``Nothing fancy, just a manila folder with tear sheets. It helps the client to focus and gives the designer a better idea of what the client likes in terms of style and color.''<ep>
   During these early meetings, the budget is ``absolutely up front. The budget is whatever the budget is,'' Ecks said. ``We are here not as judge or jury. If we can't do the job on their budget, we figure out an alternative.''<ep>
   An alternative may be doing just one room over now, or refurbishing the client's home rather than redesigning it.<ep>
   One advantage of working with a department store is that furniture prices can be much lower than those at design centers.<ep>
   ``Because we are part of Federated Department Stores, a large conglomerate that includes Bloomingdale's and Macy's, we can buy in vast quantities,'' cutting prices, Ecks said.<ql>
<m1>Included with service<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Burdines designer Roger F. Zwickel said having a department store as his prime furnishings source is a great time-saver.<ep>
   ``Unlike a design firm, we have everything here (--) housewares, crystal, flooring, mattresses. Clients can walk through the store, choose a sofa, and we can put a different fabric on it if they like. We use outside contractors for painting, plumbing and electrical work.''<ep>
   Zwickel said he shops the entire South Florida market for his clients, including showrooms in the Miami Art & Design District and the Design Center of the Americas in Dania.<ep>
   Titi Saralegui runs the design studio at Bloomingdale's at The Falls. Her design services are free, but customers are required to buy a minimum of $12,000 worth of furnishings at the store.<ep>
   ``If they spend less than $12,000, it's not a design job,'' she said. ``I take care of everything else: selection of colors for walls, tiles, draperies. I make a floor plan. There is a contract that specifies delivery time. A deposit, usually 10 percent, is required.<m1><ep>
<m0>   ``The wonderful thing about working with a department store is that the client knows the prices. There's an honesty to it. The price you see is what you pay. If there's a sale, I take advantage of it.''<ep>
   She will shop for clients in the Miami design district and at DCOTA if Bloomingdale's can't produce what her clients want. The showrooms she shops at bill Bloomingdale's, which bills Saralegui's clients.<ep>
   At Ethan Allen Home Interiors stores, all of the sales staff are designers and many are licensed. They are required to have a degree in interior design or pass Ethan Allen's corporate design test. The store in South Dade has a staff of 14; the Sunny Isles store has 10. Stacy's Ethan Allen Galleries in Davie has 16 staff designers; the branch in Boca Raton has 15.<ep>
   ``There is no fee,'' said Stan Ruby, general manager of Ethan Allen Home Interiors in South Dade. ``It's part of our service.''<ep>
   While Ethan Allen offers full-service designing, including wall coverings, carpet, custom area rugs, pictures and lamps, customers are not obligated to buy everything from that store. Each designer has a portfolio of the different jobs he has completed.<ep>
   After meeting an Ethan Allen designer, the client is asked to fill out a ``lifestyle'' questionnaire. Questions include the number of people in the household, how a room will be used, whether entertainment is casual or formal, special audio/visual/computer needs, hobbies or activities, style of existing furnishings, things the customer plans to keep, furnishings he needs, the mood he wants to create, etc.<ql>
<m1>Picking right designer<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Customers are given a copy of the Ethan Allen Treasury, a catalog that shows room settings of furnishings (--) including wallpaper and window treatments (--) that the store sells.<ep>
   ``I think it's very important that [customers] take their time in picking the person they want to help them,'' Ruby said. ``If they are uncomfortable with one designer, they can switch to another. It doesn't happen often, but it can. This is the beginning of a relationship that can go on for years or not get started at all if they don't click.''<ep>
   Decor House, which has one store in Coral Gables, has six staff designers who visit the client's home as any practitioner in a design firm does. But customers have to buy their furnishings at Decor House. In addition, the store charges a fee for its design service.<ep>
   ``It's usually 5 to 15 percent of the budget,'' Vice President Pepe Rodriguez said. ``There's no fee for smaller things. Eighty percent of our business is in Latin America, and if we fly a designer over there, of course there's going to be a fee.''<ep>
<m1>Turnkey plan for snowbirds<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Baer's Furniture, which opened its first design studio in 1979, offers design services in all nine South Florida stores with a staff of 25 interior designers.<ep>
   ``Our design service is free, but if there is a project that requires a lot of drawings, we ask for a retainer that will be applied toward the purchases,'' said Elaine Baer, who supervises the design studios.<ep>
   ``An advantage for our customers is that they are able to see many room settings and a large inventory,'' she said. ``They also have the option for special orders. We offer a turnkey operation for northern snowbirds.''<ep>
   Bob Sapan, who manages Baer's design studio in the Kendall store, said there is no set amount a client must spend to qualify for the free design service.<ep>
   ``Someone may want to do just a family room or just window treatments. We are totally flexible,'' he said. ``And they're not obligated to buy everything from Baer's.''<ep>
   Carl's Furniture Showrooms also offers free design service ``with no hidden charges, no minimum purchase,'' said Alan Steinberg, co-manager of the Kendall store with Julio Estades. ``Our designers are licensed and members of the American Society of Interior Designers. . . . We also have designers who are not licensed, but who have lots of experience.''<ep>
   While design clients are not obligated to buy furnishings at Carl's, ``we hope that when we've done floor plans, gone to the home to take measurements, created a color board with swatches if they want one, they will buy from us,'' Steinberg said.<m1><ep>
<m0>   After the furnishings are selected, a Carl's designer will go to the home to arrange the furniture and hang the pictures, Steinberg said.<ep>
   The ease of working with a furniture or department store design studio is appealing not only to customers. The arrangement suits designers who don't like the hassle of running their own business.<ep>
   ``We don't have to sell ourselves; we have Burdines behind us,'' Zwickel said. ``I had my own business in New York, and it was a lot of grief.''<ql>
<m1>DCOTA Designer on Call<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Another way consumers and designers can connect is through a new program called Designer on Call at the Design Center of the Americas in Dania. More than 50 South Florida designers have joined the program since it began in January. This is how it works:<ep>
   People seeking design assistance are introduced to a designer, who escorts them through DCOTA. There is no obligation to hire the designer, but a number of designer-client associations have developed because of the program. So far, participating designers have signed more than 30 retainers generating $1 million in new business for DCOTA, said Kate Lacusky, manager of the program.<ep>
   One such partnership developed between Craig August and Barbara Beltran. August, 38, a North Miami chiropractor, didn't think he needed design help, at first. But when he began to furnish his dream house (--) all 4,000 square feet of it (--) he gave up.<ql>
<m1><styl>cxon<m2> <ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   ``I went to a showroom and tried to find matching end tables, cocktail and sofa tables,'' he said. ``An employee told me that if I wanted matching, I should buy the whole room at one time. I learned that you `blend' these days, you don't `match.' ''<ep>
   Seeking help at DCOTA, August was introduced to Beltran, a Miami designer. After they toured the showrooms together, August hired Beltran to furnish and decorate his five-bedroom, 3 1/2-bath home in the Eastern Shores neighborhood of North Miami Beach. He recently purchased the house for $442,500.<ep>
   He expects to spend about $75,000 to complete the job.<ql>
<m1>Yuppie look is out<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   ``I saved for years for this house. Now I'm blowing it,'' said August. `I've outgrown the yuppie look of black lacquer furniture. I want something sophisticated.''<ep>
   But Beltran doesn't recommend trashing everything. ``Whatever he wants to keep, we can tie in with new purchases,'' she said. ``We'll keep the window treatment in the dining room, for example, because it's great.''<ep>
   Designer on Call has attracted clients like Robert and Johnetta Harris who never worked with a designer before.<ep>
   ``I heard from a lot of people that there was a nice design center in Dania,'' said Harris, 26, a New York Giants defensive end who lives in Heathrow, a suburb of Orlando, with his 25-year-old wife. `We decided that if we ever built a house, we would hire a designer.''<ep>
   At DCOTA, they were introduced to Elizabeth Lindholm, who is furnishing the couple's four-bedroom, four-bath home with a mix of traditional and contemporary styles. The budget for the 7,000-square-foot house is $125,000.<ql>
