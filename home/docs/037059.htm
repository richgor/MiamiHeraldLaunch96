Q.<BR>
<BR>

An American relative of German descent recently died. In his possessions, I found his mother's sewing basket. His mother was born around 1890, and in her sewing basket was, or what seems to be, a commemorative darning needle stamped ``Princess Charlotte Died'' on one side, and ``Nov 6 1817 Aged 21'' on the other. Does this commemorative piece have a history or any value beyond sentimental?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

You have a bodkin. It resembles a thick, large-size needle with a large eye and blunt end (measuring about 2 3/4-inches) and was used for drawing ribbon or tape through openwork.<P>

   Your bodkin has quite a history: It was made to commemorate Princess Charlotte of Wales, who gave birth to a stillborn son on Nov. 5, 1817, and died the following morning at age 21. If she hadn't died, Charlotte (who was the only child of King George IV and Caroline) would have been queen of England.<P>

   Your English bodkin would be of interest to collectors of sewing implements. An identical bodkin was purchased five years ago by a collector for $125. Today it would be worth more.<P>

   There were also Princess Charlotte commemorative silver thimbles, which are rare.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

We have many fishing lures that are more than 50 years old. Where can we find information about their value?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

You'll find lures of every type, age, material, design, and description ranging from patented examples to the now sought-after plastic types, pictured in color and black and white along with their current values in the 1996 fourth edition of Old Fishing Lures and Tackle -- Identification and Value Guide,  by Carl F. Luckey; it is available in a 622-page telephone-directory-size edition for $27 postpaid from Ace Enterprises, P.O. Box 59354, Chicago, Ill. 60659.<P>

   Two other favorite books that picture and price lures include the revised edition of Fishing Tackle Antiques and Collectables -- Reference and Evaluation of Pre-1960 Tackle,  by Karl T. White, which pictures and prices more than 8,000 items, for $34 postpaid, and Fishing Lure Collectibles -- An Identification and Value Guide to the Most Collectible Antique Fishing Lures  by Dudley Murphy and Rick Edmisten in hardcover for $27.95 postpaid. Both are available from Ace Enterprises. <P>

   To check out or sell old pre-1960 fishing lures and any other fishing-related items ranging from creels to reels, phone Dan Basore at (800) 347-4525. <BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

Where can I find Martin Bros. ceramic birds made in the early 1900s?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Send for a copy of the May 19, 1996, 2Oth Century Auction catalog offering two such birds made by the Martin Bros. studio of London (including a 12-inch-high example dating from 1905 estimated to bring between $8,000 and $11,000, and a 9-inch example dating from 1913, which has an estimated value between $6,000 and $8,000). One can bid by phone or mail from the all-color edition (which includes a prices-realized list sent after the sale) from John Toomey Gallery, 818 North Boulevard, Oak Park, Ill. 60301. <P>

   The catalog is loaded with Arts & Crafts, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, 50s Modern and Italian Glass, as well as American and European paintings that have collectors drooling.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

Can you tell me the monetary value of a Fostoria glass punch bowl in the American pattern that measures 13 1/2-inches in diameter and sits on a separate crystal base?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Such punch bowls on high- or low-footed bases have a value of between $200 and $300 depending on condition, size, and if they're original examples and not reproduced from an old mold.<P>

   Collectors of the desirable glass belong to The Fostoria Glass Society of America, which offers an annual membership and newsletter published eight times a year for $16, or send $2 for a single issue from FGSA, P.O. Box 826, Moundsville, W.Va. 26041. The society will hold its 16th annual convention June 6-9 in Moundsville, W. Va.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

I have an antique map (in excellent condition) of the Berry provincial area of France in 1587 by Ortelius. It is number 22 of a portfolio of maps he did in that year with French text. Where can I get it appraised?<BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Write antique map expert, dealer and appraiser George Ritzlin Maps & Books, 469 Roger Williams Ave., Highland Park, Ill. 60035-4704. Enclose a description of the map (or maps) and a self-addressed, stamped envelope for a reply.<BR>
<BR>
Q.<BR>
<BR>

How can I contact Hal Miller of Philadelphia (mentioned in a past column) who collects first-class relics of saints enclosed in small round frames or holders? I have two such relics. <BR>
<BR>
A.<BR>
<BR>

Write Hal Miller, 240 E. Evergreen Ave., Philadelphia, Pa. 19118-2823. Enclose a photo or photocopy of the relics and a self-addressed stamped envelope for a reply or offer.<BR>
<BR>

<P>

   Write Anita Gold, P.O. Box 597401, Chicago, Ill. 60659. Enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope. Not all letters can be answered. Priority will be given to those that include a copy of the column.
