<m0>   When most people think about building a multichannel home theater, they focus on speakers. Yet the real conundrum is choosing amplification for the system.<ep>
   The easiest way is with an all-in-one A/V receiver that holds an FM/AM tuner, audio/ video switcher, preamp/ surround decoder and five channels of amplification (--) for left-front, center-front, right-front, left-rear and right-rear speakers (--) all on one chassis. The most complex, and arguably the best sounding, approach is to use all separate components, including five state-of-the-art, mono-block amplifiers (--) one for each of the five channels.<ep>
   The third alternative, and the one I would propose, requires two pieces of equipment (--) an integrated A/V tuner/preamp (that contains the FM/AM tuner, switcher, preamp and surround decoder) and an all-on-one-chassis, five-channel amplifier.<ep>
   While the do-everything receiver is the least costly and most compact, and the mono-block amp approach is at the opposite extreme, the multichannel amp offers a compromise in terms of expense, space utilization and performance.<ep>
   Five-channel amps are available in a wide range designs and are priced <m1> <m0>from $849 to $4,500.<ql>
<m0>Multichannel amps<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   If you think a multichannel amp might suit your needs, here are some things to consider:<ep>
   (box) Be sure you buy an amp with sufficient power to drive your speakers. It's not a bad idea to pick one with a little extra power, for reproducing the sound tracks of those Arnold Schwarzenegger movies.<ep>
   (box) Amps with separate power supplies for each channel are better than those that share a power supply among several channels.<ep>
   (box) Try to choose an amp with individual volume controls (trim pots). They will simplify basic setup of your system.<ep>
   (box) Look for amps equipped with ``5-way binding posts'' for connecting speaker wires. These offer the flexibility of using ``banana'' (push on) plugs, ``spade'' connectors or even bare wire.<ep>
   (box) Make sure the back-panel terminals are not mounted to a flimsy surface. You'll be plugging and unplugging wires for years, so be sure the unit is up to the task.<ep>
   (box) If you think you might want to have a ``passive'' subwoofer (one that doesn't have its own, built-in amp), look for an amp with six channels.<ep>
   (box) Amps that are ``bridgeable'' allow two channels to be connected together to double the power for a power-hungry speaker.<ep>
   (box) Many amps have an ``auto-on'' feature that either senses an audio signal or a change in voltage. Both types free you from throwing another switch to turn your system on or off.<ep>
   (box) Audiophiles should look for amps that specify a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 0.05 percent or less. These amps will sound the best, but most of us needn't be so picky.<ep>
   (box) Give your amp a ``test drive'' in your home for a week or two. Make sure it meets your sonic requirements before you decide to keep it.<ql>
<m0>Good five-channel models<ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Here are three good examples of five-channel amplifiers:<ep>
   Carver model AV-405, delivers 100 watts to the three front channels, 50 watts to the two (rear) surround channels, THD 0.05 percent, not bridgeable. It employs a mono-block design, which means it has separate power supplies. Suggested retail price is $849.<ep>
   ADCOM model GF A6000 has 100 watts for each of the three front channels, 60 watts for each of the two (rear) surround channels, THD 0.09 percent, not bridgeable, 5-way binding posts. It has separate level controls for each channel, to make level-balancing easier and is priced at $900.<ep>
   Forte model FT1 has 125 watts for each of the three front channels, 55 watts for each of the two (rear) surround channels, THD 0.15 percent, not bridgeable, 5-way binding posts. An auto power-on feature lets it power-up automatically with your other components. It costs $1,790.<ql>
