<m1>   <m0>A few months ago we adopted a lovely little German shepherd from the animal shelter. We used to keep her in the house while we were at work, but when we'd come home the house would be in a shambles. She ate the arm on my couch and my pillows, and ripped the carpet. Scolding doesn't seem to help.<ep>
   We keep her in the back yard now, and she's started digging up my bushes. She also has a new habit: growling and giving us love bites when we take her for training (which doesn't work). Are there dogs who simply can't be trained, even with love? Are we doing something wrong?<ql>

<ql>
<m0>Just as with an adopted child who's had a traumatic past, you can have comparable problems with an adopted dog. Her destructiveness when left alone is probably a sign of extreme separation anxiety. It's a cry for help, not behavior that needs to be punished.<ep>
   Get her acclimated to sleeping and eating in an open crate. Then close the crate when you're gone. In time, she'll see it as her `safe haven. Remember to put in a chew toy and a blanket, and leave a radio or TV on to help her feel less alone.<ep>
   She also needs to go to obedience school with you so you can learn to handle her better. She should look to you not only as a caring friend, but as top dog. If the class you tried didn't help, ask your vet to recommend another.<ql>

<m0>My vet can't stand to see collars on cats. He once actually cut the collar off my cat when I brought her in for a routine exam.<ep>
   Presently, I have an indoor cat. My vet sternly told me not to put a collar on her. When I said I wanted a photo of her in a fancy collar, he said not to leave it on for more than an hour.<ep>
   I usually do what he tells me. But what's so dangerous about a collar?<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m1>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>Your vet has probably seen the consequences of cats wearing the wrong kind of collar. I, too, would cut a flea collar off any animal that came to me. Imagine wearing a plastic strip around your neck that emits a pesticide vapor that you breathe in and absorb through your skin. As for nonpesticide collars, indoor cats sometimes get a claw hooked into or under their collars and can't get free. This can also happen with dogs. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Also, outdoor cats have been known to choke to death or incur serious injuries when their collars get caught on fences or branches. Since all cats who go outdoors should wear an ID tag, the solution is a breakaway collarthat enables the wearer to pull its head free in an emergency.<ql>

<m1>Q.<ql>

<m0>We've had our golden retriever for 13 years, and he's just like a member of our family. About three years ago, I noticed that one of his ears was very swollen. The vet said it was a hematoma (swollen with blood), and aspirated it, but two days later, it was back again.<ep>
   So then he operated on our dog's veins. This was successful, until a month ago when the ear swelled again, requiring further surgery. However, this time the surgery did not work.<ep>
   Now the ear is still swollen, and there's a tube in it to drain the blood. I fear more surgery, since our dog is so old. Do you have any advice?<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m1>A.<ql>
<m2><ql>
<ql>
<m0>I presume he's not scratching and shaking his head because of a chronic ear infection (--) the most common cause of hematoma of the ear. Make sure he has no such problem.<ep>
   It would be best to avoid unnecessary surgery since it would mean putting your old dog at risk. If your dog isn't uncomfortable, I would not subject him to another operation. Left alone, the swelling will harden, shrink, and leave your dog with a shriveled ear. It won't be too unsightly since the long hair over his ear will help cover the deformity.<ep>
   Dogs sometimes develop ear hematomas after they've been playing too roughly or after they have been bitten on the ear in a fight. Immediate surgical intervention, before the blood clot starts to harden, usually corrects the problem. Your dog was one of the unlucky ones.<ql>
