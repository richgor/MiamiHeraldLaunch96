<m0>   Guests at Flo Woodiel's recent dinner party headed straight for the kitchen of her West Hartford, Conn., home and never left.<ep>
   There was no need for the crowd to congregate in such close quarters. The dinner was totally under control. The house had, of course, been cleaned for the occasion, so every other room in the home was available.<ep>
   But except for the occasional straggler into the living room, everyone settled in the kitchen for the night.<ep>
   ``That's my house,'' said Woodiel, a frequent entertainer. ``People literally walk in the front door, through the living room and into the kitchen.''<ep>
   Go to any party, and you'll find the majority of bodies pressed against the kitchen counters, hunkered by the stove and leaning on the fridge. Inexplicably, the kitchen has the power to draw a crowd and hold it. Casual or formal, most parties eventually seem to wind up in the kitchen.<ep>
   ``It's like being seen at the city's coolest coffee spot or nightclub,'' said Jackie Morsey, a self-proclaimed party animal from Hartford. ``It's definitely the place to be during parties.''<ql>
<m1>Koppel in the kitchen<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Jay Ginewsky, owner of The Whisk, a Canton, Conn., catering service, said he recently was forced to shoo TV journalist Ted Koppel out of a kitchen during an especially formal event.<ep>
   ``He was staring at this chicken that wasn't even cooked,'' Ginewsky said, chuckling. ``I finally had to say, `Ted, it's frozen. Go away.' ''<ep>
   And just a few weeks ago, Janet Youmans of West Hartford attended a dinner party hosted by a top-level Aetna executive that for the most part took place in her kitchen.<ep>
   ``She wore this lacy apron over her dress and rolled out pizza dough on the countertop while everyone stood around eating hors d'oeuvres and drinking wine,'' said Youmans, co-owner of Celebrations Unlimited, a West Hartford company that plans events.<ep>
   Answers to the great kitchen mystery include everything from the simple (--) hunger (--) to the philosophical (--) the search for emotional warmth.<ep>
   ``We all grew up basically living in the kitchen,'' Ginewsky said. ``Everything happened in the kitchen, so it just feels natural to want to be in there.''<ql>
<m1>Can't keep people out<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Frequent entertainers said that people who like to cook, the especially helpful and, of course, those looking for the brewskies, are usually the first guests to settle among the pots and pans. But the real reason for partygoers' huddling among the appliances, most admitted, is pure, unadulterated curiosity.<ep>
   ``People seem more willing to share things when they're surrounded by metal,'' Morsey said. ``The best gossip can always be had in a kitchen.''<ep>
   For safety reasons, Ginewsky and his staff have blocked the entrance to kitchens with chairs, jokingly warned hosts to keep their guests away and literally told people to keep out. But even those tactics keep kitchen crawlers away for only so long.<ep>
   ``I usually tell people it's $25 if they want to watch and $28.50 if they want to help,'' Ginewsky said. ``That usually clears them out for a while.''<ep>
   When those tactics fail, many employ an old host's trick.<ep>
   ``If you don't want people in the kitchen, then definitely put the food and drinks somewhere else,'' said Joan Walden, owner of Joan Walden Enterprises, an event-planning company in West Hartford.<ql>
<m1>Bigger and better<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   Despite the tricks, people are starting to realize that accommodating guests with a gusto for the kitchen can be fun and profitable.<ep>
   Eight years ago, Woodiel remortgaged her house to renovate and expand her kitchen, and just last year, Walden had her kitchen redone. Caterers also have begun to incorporate kitchens into gatherings, often letting people watch, or even serving the meal in the room.<ep>
   And area builders report an increasing demand for bigger and better kitchens with more user-friendly and conventional amenities, such as center islands.<ep>
   ``My clients' biggest demands are for large, comfortable kitchens,'' said Bill Ferrigno, president of Sunlight Construction in Avon and president-elect of the Home Builders Association of Hartford County. ``Maybe it's a return to some basic value that the hearth is central to the home.''<ep>
   Attention also has shifted from the more traditional living rooms to the great room or family room, which connects to the kitchen.<ep>
   ``There's really no reason why any house built from now on should have a living room,'' Ginewsky said. ``Think about it. The only people you put in there are people you don't really care for, or that don't really care for you.''<ql>
