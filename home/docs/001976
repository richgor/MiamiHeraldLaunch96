<m0>   An appraisal (--) an educated opinion of the market value of a property (--) is required by most lenders before they will approve a mortgage. The lender selects the appraiser, but the borrower usually pays the fee, $200 to $500 or more, depending on the location and size of the property.<ep>
    An appraiser determines market value by comparing the property to three others in the vicinity that are similar and that have been sold within the past six months. The appraiser adds to the value of the property for amenities it has that the others don't and subtracts for those it lacks. <m1><ep>
<m0>   Appraisals are somewhat subjective. They should be done by someone who knows the area. Establishing value is easier in tract developments, where there is consistency in home size and amenities, than it is in neighborhoods with lots of variability. Appraisals are easier to do when prices are relatively stable. <m1><ql>
<m1>Loan-to-value ratio<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>   When lenders evaluate loan applications, they look at the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. The LTV is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the property.<ep>
    The appraisal report is used to establish the value for the LTV equation. Let's say you have agreed to pay $175,000 for a property, and you have applied for a 90 percent loan, $157,500. If the property is appraised for $175,000, your LTV will be 90 percent. As long as your ratios are adequate, and your credit is good, your loan should be approved.<ep>
    But if the property is appraised for $170,000, you have a problem. The lender may still be willing to give you a loan, but it may not be for the amount you need. The lender may only be willing to lend based on a 90 percent loan-to-value ratio. Ninety percent of a $170,000 appraised value is only $153,000 (--) $4,500 less than what you requested.<ep>
    In this case, you would have a legitimate way out of the contract, provided you included a contingency in your purchase agreement for the property to be appraised for the purchase price.<ql>
<m1>Alternatives<ql>
<m2><ql>
<m1><ep>
<m0>    But if you do want to go ahead, either you'll need to come up with the additional cash or the sellers will have to agree to lower price. If the sellers won't reduce their price, they may be willing to lend you the amount you are short. However, that would require the lender's approval.<ep>
    Another approach, if you are convinced that the low appraisal is a mistake, is to ask the lender to review the appraisal. Have your real estate agent provide data on comparable sales to show the lender that the property should be appraised for the purchase price, or hire another appraiser to do this.<ep>
    A last resort is to take the loan package to a different lender. In general, portfolio lenders tend to be more lenient. You may want to discuss the low appraisal with a new lender. Provide comparables and get assurances that the loan will be approved before you apply.<ep>
    According to the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1991, borrowers who pay for an appraisal are entitled to a copy, if they ask within a reasonable period. Technically, the request should be made in writing, but an oral request to your loan originator should be sufficient.<ep>
