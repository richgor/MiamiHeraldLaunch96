<m0>   General contractor Mark built a home for Edward and Rhonda. After moving in, they noticed the hardwood floors were warping.<ep>
   Mark tried to remedy the problem, but it got worse. Mark offered to replace the floors, but Edward and Rhonda wanted to wait until the cause could be discovered and corrected. Edward and Rhonda sued Mark, alleging the house was negligently designed and built.<ep>
   Mark carried $500,000 in liability insurance (for $60,000 annually in premiums). He notified his insurer, West American Insurance Co., of the lawsuit. The company advised Mark to hire a lawyer, since his interests conflicted with the insurer.<ep>
   West American offered Mark $40,000 to settle and threatened not to pay his lawyer unless he agreed. Mark settled under protest for $56,500 and gave the money to Edward and Rhonda. Then West American sued Mark for reimbursement of the $56,500, plus legal fees.<ep>
   But Mark countersued West American for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and economic duress. Mark testified to extreme emotional distress, which cost him his construction business and more than $323,000 in attorney fees.<ep>
   If you were on the jury, would you award damages to Mark? <m1><ep>
<m0>   The jury said yes, awarding Mark $1.316 million in actual damages caused by West American's failure to settle the dispute fairly, and $12 million in punitive damages. <m1><ep>
<m0>   The Court of Appeals affirmed the jury's award, emphasizing that West American pressured Mark to settle for a low amount because it is less expensive to settle than litigate cases; if Mark were found not liable for the construction defects, then West American could not sue Mark for reimbursement.<ep>
   Based on the 1995 California Court of Appeals decision in West American Insurance Co. vs. Freeman, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 555.<ql>
