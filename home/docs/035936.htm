By STEVE RITTER<BR>
And MARY MISITIS<BR>
Herald Columnists<BR>
<BR>
Our neighbor has lots of brush growing in the back yard to hide a chicken coop. We are getting lots of snakes in our yard and I am scared of them. Is there anything I can get to repel these snakes?<BR>
F.L., Perrine<BR>
<BR>
Short of getting a cat, dog, ferret, hawk, owl or some other hunter to patrol your yard, you will find it difficult to repel snakes. If you keep all brush cleared from your yard, giving the snakes few places to hide, they may go elsewhere.<P>

  However, consider yourself lucky to have snakes. Snakes are quite beneficial and eat large quantities of unwanted insects and rodents.<BR>
<BR>
We have a citrus tree that has been declining. There don't seem to be any symptoms we can recognize except for the occasional notching of leaves. Can you help us guess what's wrong?<BR>
O.L., Fort Lauderdale<BR>
<BR>
Your citrus tree is probably being attacked by the citrus root weevil. The small weevil is black to white to aqua colored, with a pointed snout. It causes gradual or sudden decline of the tree. The adults of all species notch the trees leaves and the juveniles build galleries in the roots.<P>

  The weevil has recently been identified as being very active in the Fort Lauderdale area. The adult can be controlled with Sevin applied in accordance with the label directions. The tree should be sprayed twice when adults are observed.<BR>
<BR>
We have a jacaranda tree that has been in the ground for seven years. We have yet to see one single flower. What can we do to get the tree to flower?<BR>
K. D., Homestead<BR>
<BR>
Be patient and wait. Jacaranda trees (Jacaranda mimosifolia), when started from seed, often do not flower for the first 7 to 14 years. To get a newly planted tree to flower, you can purchase an older tree or a grafted tree. The beauty of purchasing a grafted tree is that you get a tree identical to a proven bloomer with a good blue flower.<BR>
<BR>
Our neighbor has a large gumbo limbo tree and volunteered to give us either a large branch to plant, or one of the seedlings sprouting under the tree canopy. Which would be better to use for a tree in our own yard?<BR>
J. C.,Miami<BR>
<BR>
If you have the option of a seedling or a cutting, choose the seedling gumbo limbo (Bursera simaruba). Trees started from seed have a more upright growth habit and quicker growth than those started from cuttings. Seedling trees also tend to have a stronger root system and better adult shape than trees started from cuttings.<P>

   The only time we would recommend using cuttings over seedlings in starting shade trees is if the parent tree has a desired trait you desire.<P>

   Cuttings will produce a clone, which is genetically identical to the parent plant.<BR>
<BR>
We seem to have more and more nutsedge growing with the St. Augustine turf. What can be used to get rid of the sedge?<BR>
W.L., Indian Creek Village<BR>
<BR>
Besides hand-pulling the sedge and digging out the roots, nutsedge can be controlled with Imazaquin, applied pre- or postemergence, and is effective on most of the sedges. Use this and all chemicals in accordance with the label directions.<BR>
<BR>
In a catalog I was reading, the caladiums were sold as tubers and the gladiolii were called corms. What is the difference?<BR>
H.D., Fort Lauderdale<BR>
<BR>
A tuber, such as caladium, is a thickened underground stem with many buds on its surface. A corm, such as a gladiolus, is a solid mass of stem tissue with a terminal bud on top. Corms, tubers and even bulbs are stems modified for nutrient storage and, like seeds, are a means of propagation for a plant. But unlike seeds, which produce a genetically different plant from the parents, a corm, tuber, or bulb will produce a plant identical to the parent plant.<BR>
