It's called the New Urbanism, an architectural movement  that seeks to halt the spread of walled, homogeneous subdivisions and proposes to replace them with something like a traditional town. </P>

	<P>Led by Miami architects Andres Duany and  Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, the revival of neo-traditional town planning has enchanted the media, repeatedly getting favorable coverage in, among  others, Metropolitan Home, Time and Newsweek, which last May devoted a 13-page cover story to New  Urbanist concepts.</P>

Know these key terms for purchase contracts</a></FONT></B>
<DD>Spring is the busiest time of year for real estate agents because this is when most home sales take place. But finding the residence you want to buy is just the first step. An essential part of successfully negotiating to buy that home is preparing a sales contract that protects the buyer, seller and realty agent. <P>

Buyers can sue sellers for failure to disclose defects</a></FONT></B>
<DD>Q. Almost three months ago we bought our first home. But it has turned into a nightmare. The refrigerator stopped working. The water heater barely heats the water. The roof leaks. The floors are soft and spongy. We foolishly bought direct from the seller without the benefit of a realty agent. How can we get our money back? <P>

Bodkin commemorates death of Princess of Wales</a></FONT></B>
<DD>Q. An American relative of German descent recently died. In his possessions, I found his mother's sewing basket. His mother was born around 1890, and in her sewing basket was, or what seems to be, a commemorative darning needle stamped ``Princess Charlotte Died'' on one side, and ``Nov 6 1817 Aged 21'' on the other. Does this commemorative piece have a history or any value beyond sentimental? <P>

5-channel amps: sound compromise</a></FONT></B>
<DD>When most people think about building a multichannel home theater, they focus on speakers. Yet the real conundrum is choosing amplification for the system.    The easiest way is with an all-in-one A/V receiver that holds an FM/AM tuner, audio/ video switcher, preamp/ surround decoder and five channels of amplification -- for left-front, center-front, right-front, left-rear and right-rear speakers -- all on one chassis. The most complex, and arguably the best sounding, approach is to use all separate components, including five state-of-the-art, mono-block amplifiers -- one for each of the five channels. <P>

Age of owners not only factor to keep out kids</a></FONT></B>
<DD>Q. Our condo board called a vote of the unit owners to make our project an ``adult community'' for people 55 years old and older in an effort to keep kids out. Most of us, however, recognize that the condo, built in the '70s, is full of 80-year-olds who soon may need to put their units up for sale. They would find the value of their apartment and the depth of the market would be greatly reduced if the age limitation restriction were passed. <P>

Antique or copy? Finding originals becoming tougher</a></FONT></B>

A warm Mother's Day story: Love that old stove!</a></FONT></B>
<DD>W hen it comes to loyalty and long-term relationships, Ellen Teagarden considers herself especially fortunate.    Her Magic Chef stove has lasted more than 55 years, a longevity she attributes, in part, to dedicated scouring. ``The beauty of the stove is that I can take it apart and really clean inside those burners,'' said the 84-year-old Dallas resident. <P>

Wicker's appeal: flexibility, durability</a></FONT></B>
<DD>The term ``wicker'' refers to a particular style of ornamental, woven furniture, not to a specific material.    Wicker furniture uses the techniques of basket-weaving through supporting spokes. It may be made of materials like cane, willow, reed, rattan, rush, raffia, or Oriental sea grass. The term ``wicker'' comes from the Swedish words ``vikker,'' meaning willow, and ``wiker,'' to bend. <P>

<DD>Many bedraggled royal palms in South Florida seem to be having bad hair days, their brown fronds full of brittle and split leaflets.    Coconut palms nearly everywhere you turn are clutching hayfields of lower brown or yellowish fronds, made more conspicuous by the new greens of spring adorning the mahoganies, seagrapes and pigeon plums. <P>
